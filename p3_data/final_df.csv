"Living overseas, investing in the US...worried about getting scammed. How to verify these brokers are legitimate?","Hi everyone, I'm living overseas at the moment and our investment opportunities are limited. We're unable to access normal retirement investments due to our residence overseas, so we've turned to a company called Harrison Brook, which allows us to invest our money in the US. I'm not sure I completely understand it, but they claim to operate through something called Beacon Global Advisor Network which is a registered investment advisor in the US, in order to be able to help expats with investing in the US. They handle this through a SEI Investments Company platform.

Everything we've spoken to them about and done with them has appeared to be above board. As we're getting ready to transfer funds to them however, I'm getting nervous. It's a lot of money (for us), and I don't want to see it disappear.

To their credit, they've not been pushy at all, but I do worry about being scammed.

Is there a way to verify these guy's legitmacy? I've only found positive things online more or less, but I'm not really sure what to look for. The situation they've described that allows us to invest seems complex, but  in our research this *isn't* a simple situation anyway. Any advice is appreciated!",0,1731653447.0

Early withdrawal after termination with outstanding loan,"I’m going to go over what I think I know. I’m very aware I could be wrong on many points. 

Took a loan from 401k and vested balance was reduced by the loan amount. Termination of employment occurs. Vested balance is $10,000 with  loan balance of $1,000. I need to withdraw the $10,000. Not concerned with tax implications or the 10% withdrawal penalty. Do I have any options to be able to receive the full $10,000 minus the taxes that are required to be withheld even if  the total $11,000 would be considered taxable? If not, is there any way I could set it up where I only receive $9,000 minus required tax withholdings but only the $9,000 would be considered taxable?",0,1732382751.0

Breed Questionnaire!,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
   * Yes *my* first dog but I have grown up with Dogs all my life and I have been doing dog sitting for about a year now looking after many different dogs with varying personalities and needs from bubbly puppies and helping keep training in line to elderly dogs that I had to help poop and even nervous dogs that usually hate new people that I have won over :)
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
   * I could definitely deal with getting a rescue but I would like a puppy so I can start from scratch with it and so I have a longer term buddy.
3. Describe your ideal dog.
   * Loves a walk (but only needs one or two a day - thanks work life balance...), good with other dogs so they can be mates with my mum and neighbours dogs (needs to be part of the gang) and not very vocal at all (I live in a flat/apartment and dont like being a noisy neighbour)
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
   * Retrievers and Cockapoos seem to be a great fit but I am fairly agnostic. I know what I dont like more than what I do like - which is why I'm doing this post...
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
   * Dont have to do all the tricks in the book, I'm happy with the basics and having good recall so I can trust the dog out on walks.
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
   * Nope

**Care Commitments**

1. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
   * I work from home so can commit to 1 or 2 walks a day depending on schedule and will spend all day with them in the house and can often be away from my desk when they need some attention but I would appreciate being able to get on with work during the day. Typical day would be 7am walk 45min to an hour, get my head down in the morning, lunchtime walk 30 to 45mins and then can give some attention in the afternoon and chill in the evening.
2. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
   * I live very close to a good place to walk, the end of the road is an entrance to the local woods and there are lots of people walking dogs there often. Typical day will have 2 walks here resulting in around 1.5hrs of walking a day.
3. How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
   * I wouldnt mind brushing weekly but I dont want to have too much to do on this front. I know a local groomer and would consider taking the dog regularly but would prefer to have less grooming to do than otherwise.

**Personal Preferences**

1. What size dog are you looking for?
   * Medium. Cockapoo/Collie seems to be the perfect size for me, I like to be able to pick the dog up for a cuddle but I dont like small dogs as much.
2. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
   * Dont mind shedding, less is a bonus but shedding isnt a deal breaker. Barking I really wanna avoid, I hate being the neighbour with a noisy dog and live somewhere with a loud front door right by my living room with people coming and going from other flats/apartments, I would hate having a dog that barked every time someone else left the building. Slobber I dislike but a little bit isnt a dealbreaker.
3. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
   * I always do this out on walks, I even trust dogs where their owners dont and they get on great with me as I keep control still. But thats it really, otherwise will be out in the garden or in the house, I dont have some big plot of land they will be running around on.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

1. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
   * Love cuddles but dont like the dog to be needy like begging for attention.
2. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
   * In the middle on this one. I feel like if I want a cuddly dog they will be on the eager-to-please spectrum by default tho?
3. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
   * Friendlyness on this front is important. Can understand the odd bark when there is a knock at the door but dont want a very vocal dog.
4. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
   * No - and this is a must. I live close to my Mum and would want to walk the dog with hers and take it over to her house often as well as be able to be walked with my neighbours dog who I already walk a couple times a week.
5. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
   * Eating poo! I hate this but could probably deal with it ok... it just makes me feel ill thinking about it haha. Chewing is also something I dislike in a dog, I hate being worried about my stuff around the house.

**Lifestyle**

1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
   * Not often at all. I work from home and would make sure I can take the dog with me when I go out or leave it with someone when I can't
2. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
   * Just me. I would maybe leave it with my mum or get my sister to help out sometimes but they get no say in what breed I get >:)
3. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
   * The people above me have Cats, thats about it and I would want the cats to get to know the dog and be friends if possible, otherwise we would just avoid them (which is what I have been doing with about 95% success with all the dog sitting I have done this year)
4. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
   * No but I like a dog that is good on this front, good personality trait in my opinion.
5. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
   * I rent but no restrictions by weight (I guess this is an american thing? I also have a really chill landlord so maybe its just me)
6. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
   * UK banned breeds (its ok I dont like them anyway) - American Pit Bulls, XL Bully, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino, Fila Braziliero
7. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
   * Summer is mid-20s and winder gets down to around freezing but mostly low 10s. (Degrees C)

Other notes:

* I dislike dogs that have weird fashionable breeding characteristics and dont really want a small dog. I like a proper dog with a typical shape snout and body. Really short legs or a scrunched up face they cant breathe through are really ugly to me. I have a bias towards how a collie looks (my first dog as a kid was a collie cross) but I'm not sure I would be able to be active enough for a collie and not sure it would be a great fit as a breed.",1,1728596524.0
Dog just peed on my bed?,"My dog (well technically not mine, he's my sister/brother in laws who live with us but definitely favors me in the house) is a 2-3 year old Shih Tzu/Maltese and has always been very cuddly and has very much lapdog qualities of always wanting affection and being close to me or the other family members. He tends to always sleep in my bed as well.

Just a bit ago, he had been whining which I assumed he did because he wanted attention and he also sometimes does it when he needs a bit of encouragement or help to jump on the bed. He successfully jumped on the bed, began to whine a bit more, started digging at my bed a bit and then out of no where, I felt him begin to pee on my bed and partially my leg. I looked it up and the reasons on google said that it could be anywhere from anxiety to a medical disease to marking territory? Does anyone have an idea for why that might have happened? Even when he's been needing to go outside he's usually more barky or insistent. Additionally, even the one time when he was younger when he had to go out and I was asleep, he still chose to jump on the ground to poop rather than do it in the bed.

One factor that I wonder is that I was gone this weekend to stay the night at my boyfriends and if it was an abandonment behavior? But it's not like this is the first time I've left for extended periods",1,1726465446.0

Pee pad training,I have an 8 year old frenchie female who was my boyfriends parents until a few months ago when we bought a house and now she lives with us. His parents bred her and she lived with 30+ other dogs and was taught to pee on pee pads all over the house. This is my first dog ever so this has been quite the challenge. We take her out several times a day but she often won’t go to the bathroom until she comes back inside. I have pee pads for her in the living room that she does use but won’t use if we’re in the room. She has had three litters so I give her a pass on not always being able to hold it in for us to bring her outside. I bought a dog crate with a wooden box to go over it thinking it would give her some privacy but she won’t go in the crate if it has the top on or just pees on a carpet in another room if we’re in the room.

Got terminated from a startup. Need motivation to find my next gig,"Since COVID, my career has taken a pause. I moved to a new country (Canada) during COVID after I quit my previous job in the US. I now permanently live in Canada. For the last year, I worked for a startup, gave it my all but never went anywhere. Failed to secure investment. So, haven't been paid on that role (executive role) - dealing with lawyers on that. 

The thing is I am tired and exhausted of constantly looking for the next challenge that I would truly love. Trying to figure out what to do. With regards to finances, I am ok. 

1. Have over 200k US in a brokerage account that is my primary trading account that I use to withdraw monthly expenses. 

2. Around 100k US in my IRA account. 

3. 55k US in my bank account and 5k CAD

4. I get a settlement payment in april around $105k US 

5. Debt is around 50k US - around multiple credit cards.

I am confident of securing a 6 figure role but I am realistically giving myself 6 months. Then I will be comfortable with salary as cash flow than rely on trading for my expenses. I just feel behind in terms of getting a place of my own, but I can't figure out where in the world I want to live and work. 

I do recognize I am in a better place financially, but I still feel more i.e. making smarter investments in real estate or something. I don't know. 

Sorry for the rant!

Pay down loans or invest in stocks,"Hello,

I have been paying more than required for my student and car loan, I know it doesn't make financial sense since it is worth more in the stock market. But I also want to stop paying the loans faster since it will be nice to be done paying them in 2 years rather than like 5. But if it's a dumb thing to do then I will stop.

Car loan- $17k owed, pay 500/month but been paying 700/month interest rate 6%

School- $13.5k owed $250/month but been paying 500/month interest rate 4%

So I could be putting an extra 450/month into stocks and my portfolio has gone up 35% in the last year.

I know basic math tells me the money is better in stocks but someone tell me I'm dumb because not having payments in 2 years rather than 5 also sounds really nice.

What's your daily dog routine?,"We all know dogs love routines, so I'm just wondering what everyone's typical day looks like. 

My dog loves to sleep in, so I have to work hard to get her up to go potty and eat breakfast before I leave for work. How do I do it? Scrambled eggs. Every. Single. Morning. 

She sleeps while I'm at work, and when I get home at 3:00, we play fetch in the backyard. She'd go forever if I let her, but after about 10 minutes of hard running, we come back inside while I unwind for a bit.

After she's calmed down, we usually wrestle with her stuffies for a while, and then she stops and stares at me until I give her an afternoon snack. I give her food some time to settle, and then I put my shoes on and take her for a 1.5-2 mile walk.

Afterwards I make dinner, with her supervising very attentively, hoping for a few scraps along the way. When the family is done eating, she gets her after-dinner treats, where she goes through a random list of her tricks to get each of the treats.

Once the kitchen has been cleaned up, she gets something to chew on (usually a bully stick or no-hyde chew) while everyone gets settled in for the night. 

Around 9 or so, she finally wants dinner, so she gets her biggest meal of the day, and then it's snuggle time in bed. She stays there for an hour or so, and then she chooses to retire to her crate for the remainder of the night.

Wife is in hospice. We expect some monetary gifts that will be put to our children' 529 plans. Lots of questions.,"So as the title, my lovely wife (35F) has started hospice two days ago after fighting colon cancer for the past 3.5 years. We have 3 young boys (5YO, 3.5YO, 3.5YO). Due to costly medical procedures, we have never had extra money to put aside for the their education. We are expecting gifts (a few hundreds to a few thousands dollars) from relatives/friends. We already have funeral fund reserved, so we want to set this money aside for college if they so choose in the future. I have been researching for the past few weeks regarding 529 plans for our state Maryland.

However, there are a few questions I still have:

* Should I go with Maryland 529 plans instead of Nevada (or any other states) 529 plans? NV 529 seem to have the best reviews/recommendations due to their low fees, better yield/returns for investment. Going with MD 529 plans, I will have $2500/child tax deduction, which seem to be a minimal benefit compared to the better yield rates of NV 529 plans. MD 529 is administered by T. Rowe Price.
* It seems that I can open an umbrella 529 plan under my name (36 year-old) and name our kids as beneficiaries. Would that help with their Financial Aid situation in anyway? Any benefits of doing that instead of individual 529 plans for each child? From my understanding, if they have assets (529 plans under their names) during the FAFSA application, their Financial Aid amount will be smaller. I don't want to take advantage of the system, but I also want the best potential support for my children and maximize the value of our investment.
* If I choose MD plans, should I avoid MD's prepaid trust plan? It seems great on paper, but so many parents have issues getting money. Is that still an issue?
* Any other plans I should look at? Opening a 529 plans with Vanguard seems to be a pretty good investment as well. MD 529 (ran by T. Rowe Price) has higher fee (.64%) than Vanguard (.03%).
* My wife has been staying at home for the past 7 years, so she has insufficient social credits. Hence, the children will not get any survivor benefits. I am on my own to support them, which I have no complaints about. I just want to ensure the best possible future for them.

Thank you in advance.

Tax and investment advice to deal with 401k required minimum distribution,"Good afternoon everyone!  My mother-in-law asked me for some advice on her situation and I'd like to get some feedback if possible.  She's trying to maximize her funds, minimize her tax burden.

A little bit about her:

* Turned 72 this year and therefore next year she'll be required to take the minimum distribution.  She's not touched it yet, doesn't need the cash at present and is doing fine on her Social Security.
* RMD will be about $20k (and will almost double her current annual income).
* SS is about $24k a year.
* 401k is mostly in stocks according to her (she's not very savvy, I will be reviewing myself to better understand positions).
* Does not currently have a Roth or taxable brokerage account.
* Lives in CT.
* House is paid off but does have an property tax bill for it of $8k/yr.  CT gives a credit of $200 for her tax bracket towards home taxes paid.
* Not married or planning to get married, lives with long-term partner.



My thoughts:

* Start moving 401k funds into less risky investments due to her age.
* Open Roth and taxable brokerage accounts for her.
* Use RMD to max Roth, put rest in taxable brokerage.  Similar investments as the 401k, lower risk stuff due to age.

Do you think my plan is good?  Is there anything else you would do or something different?  In the short term to limit risk but maximize her return should I be looking for other vehicles like CDs while the returns aren't too bad on them (I know with the Fed rate changes this isn't going to last)?",0,1731608444.0
Should I liquidate all my investments to buy a house with 20% down or keep my investments and go for an FHA loan?,"Hi all,
I’m in a bit of a financial dilemma and would love some advice. I have around $70k invested outside of my 401(k) across stocks, bonds, and other assets. I’m thinking about using these funds for a 20% down payment on a house to avoid PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) and keep my mortgage payments lower.

However, I’m also considering leaving my investments in the market and going for an FHA loan, which would allow me to buy a house with just 3.5% down, keeping my investments intact and possibly benefiting from market growth.

Here’s what I’m weighing:

Option 1 (Liquidate investments for 20% down): Avoid PMI, lower monthly payments, and fully own a larger portion of the home right away. But, I’d be pulling out most of my investments, which could be difficult to get back into once liquidated.
Option 2 (Use 3.5% FHA loan): Keep my $70k in the market, potentially benefit from growth, but my monthly mortgage payments will be higher due to PMI and possibly a higher interest rate.
What do you think is the best financial move here? Should I prioritize avoiding PMI, or is it better to stay invested and accept the higher costs of an FHA loan?

Thanks in advance for any insights!",0,1732240181.0

Is it dumb to finance a car at 18? ,"The car I currently drive is old & not very reliable - insurance is as cheap as u could get for my age and it’s under 50K miles. I do an hour commute 3-4x a week and maybe 30-5 miles every other day. 

I’m a uni student and I receive just over 8K a year in student finance and I work alongside. My job is non contracted so some weeks I could work 48 hrs and other weeks I’m doing under 20. My pay has ranged from £700pm to 1500pm.

I want to finance a car with a 1K deposit? this would mean 128pm / 2yrs with finance. 

My month bills (rent, insurance, phone bill, petrol) are around £340 give or take. With the car payment it would bring it up to 470pm, excluding usual monthly spending on other shopping, necessities and activities. 

I have a decent amount in savings atm but do expect this to increase soon. 

I was hoping to get a new car at the start of 2025, but is it better to just save up and buy a used car outright? 

If I cut out stupid spending & put my sf towards the car I could save £7500 by April towards a car. And I  could expect to get around £1500 for my car rn. The cars I’ve been looking at are around 5-6K so this could take into account insurance costs.

My dad wants me to open a credit card under my name with 0 interest for 2 years for him to transfer his debt there.,"Hello, I (26F) recently moved back into my dad’s house after living independently for over 8 years due to not being able to afford rent in the city I was living in. I have a good job and make more than my dad but housing in the city is too much. Him and I have had a rocky relationship as he used to be abusive and neglectful and I did stop talking to him for a year, but since moving in we have been doing better. I am only paying $250 a month for rent and only spend half of the month in his house and the rest at my boyfriend’s. My dad recently asked me if I could open a credit card under my name since I have a good credit score for him to transfer his credit card balance and pay it off with no interest for a year or 2. I didn’t ask for the amount but I am guessing he has 5-10k in credit card debt, or else he could just pay it off at once. I really don’t want to because I dont want to be responsible for his debt in the case he decides to stop paying or if we get in a rocky situation again. I feel obligated since he is letting me stay at his house. Is it even legal to do this? Would I get in trouble? How could it affect me if i agree? What would you do in this situation?

Looking for breed recommendations,"Myself (25M) and partner (23F) are looking to get a dog as we move into a house/ townhouse instead of an apartment. I work in the largest pet store chain in Australia so I've had taining on dog breeds and care, but advice here for day to day ownership would be more beneficial than the general information I know about nutrition, grooming etc.

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Owned family dogs when I was younger, but first dog I will own myself as an adult

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Medium sized, medium-long coat dog that will be a companion going out to places, lots of walks and trips to the local beach, parks etc and a dog that can be both inside and outside

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Australian Shepherd as we are in Australia so we see many, they are the correct size and have a beautiful look and temperament. I'm also fond of Belgian mallinois, border collies and larger dogs like German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans etc but they may be better suited later on after more experience training and owning dogs myself

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The basics of sit, stay, shake. Some more advanced tricks, I'm very interested in the training aspect so I'd love to be able to train the dog to follow me by my side without a leash and come to me on command (at home and in off leash environments, I'd always keep it on a leash otherwise)

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No competing or work for the dog

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Minimum one hour everyday, longer on days I don't work, I'm very interested in the training aspect so I would spend longer on this in addition to playing and walking, as well as smaller interactions many times a day, the dog would be well a part of the family

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Minimum one hour everyday with a walk, and taking it to a dog park once a week ideally, and playing with the dog in the backyard daily.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I will brush and groom the dog as much as it needs, and will pay to have it done professionally every so often

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium size

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Average amount of shedding, average amount of barking but ideally kept to a minimum as the property has close neighbours 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I'd definitely like to be able to train it to do this 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in the middle is fine

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Given that I'm very interested in training I'd say eager to please

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

* A guarding presence would be nice, but friendly once it knows everything is safe, but it isn't extremely necessary if the dog doesn't have much of a guarding demeanour

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes, but my partner would be much more comfortable with a dog that isn't aggressive so that is also a consideration 

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Maximum of 8 hours if me and my partner are both gone for work, but some days we have separate off days so it may only be alone for a few days of the week during that time period 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My partner has similar preferences to me but they aren't interested in training the dog anymore than toilet training/basics, they will mainly take it for walks or play it with/accompany it with me

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We plan on having a cat as well in the future

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not now but in a few years

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We will be renting but a medium size dog is fine in these conditions

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in NSW Australia, Pitbulls and fighting dogs are banned here

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer can be mid-high 30 degrees C with humidity, winter is around 10-15 degrees C

**Additional Information and Questions**

25)	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* As previously mentioned, I work in a pet store so I interact with dogs daily and have been trained on their requirements and behaviour, so I feel like I have a good foundation on owning a dog. I also have a large employee discount so there's no barrier to providing high quality products for the dog",1,1727699921.0

Adopted husky has turned our home into a war zone ,"We recently adopted a 7 year old female husky and our home has turned into a war zone. We have 3 other dogs, two females (7) and one boy (5), all of them smaller than our husky. We rescued our boy from the pound a few years ago and he is STILL working on coming out of his shell, even though he’s com a longggg way. Our husky is full of energy and does not act like she’s 7, so all she wants to do is play. Our female dogs have been slowly warming up to her but our boy really hasn’t. Our husky has picked up on our boy not being happy and has taken that as a challenge. Our boy is never the one to attack first, I’m not sure what he’s giving off, but it’s making her lunge first. Thankfully we can see the body language change and intervene before it gets too bad, however, at first we thought she just wanted to play with him, now we’re thinking it’s something else. Even after we get in the middle of them, our boy is shaking scared and our husky is still trying to get to him. After we take their mind off of it, like take them outside for example, everybody is fine and happy and running around together. So, 🤯 

We also noticed yesterday that she was just wandering around the house aimlessly and one of female dogs was eating. The husky kept circling our female dog that was eating and then once we called her away, she came into the living room and got into another fight with our boy. Was she hunting? Is she bored? We’re at a loss. 

She truly is a sweet girl however she has been alone almost all of her life, with occasional interactions with other dogs. Her first owner was a friend of the family and he had her for 2 years. He was elderly and passed so my grandfather helped find her another home with an elderly man as a solo dog and he has had her for the last 5, until she became too much for him in his age. We have absolutely no history on if/how she was trained, we just know she had very limited interactions with other dogs. She was with my grandfather for a bit but he has 3 other big husky dogs and she just seemed to fall in line. Is it because she’s the biggest? Is this normal husky behavior? I know huskies can be unpredictable and protective, and if that was never broken in her are we playing with fire? ",1,1728314650.0

A medical bill I didn’t know existed was sent to collections. Advice?,"I got a call from a collections company about an $800 unpaid medical bill from 9 months ago. The thing is, I never received a bill nor any other type of communication - until now. I called the hospital and they claim they sent out the bill FIVE TIMES to my home address. I verified they have the correct address, but I never saw any of the bills. I’m very confused and obviously sound like a liar - how could 5 bills not show up in the mail?! They did confirm they never tried calling or emailing me before sending it to collections even though they had my contact info because they “don’t do that”. 

I do suspect the bill is legit because I did get medical care around the time they say the bill is from. I thought my insurance handled it since I never saw any bill but didn’t realize part of the care I received was out of network. The collections company is sending me an itemized bill so I’m not doing anything until I can review that.

I tried telling the hospital about the situation and asked if they could take this back from collections so I could work it out with them directly, but they said that’s not possible.

Assuming the itemized bill looks legit, what’s my best course of action here? Do I try to negotiate with collections to pay a lower amount? Is there some kind of complaint I can file?

Dog Boots for Goat Head Spurs,"I recently moved into a rental house that is INFESTED with goat head spurs and my two pups keep getting them stuck in their paws while playing in the back yard. I’m doing what I can to get rid of them but it seems it will take a while for them to be fully gone.

In the meantime, does anyone have any recommendations for brands of shoes/boots with a thick enough sole to stop the thorns from poking their paws?

TW: Slightly morbid question wrt my late Alsatian ,"Hi all!   
I’m so sorry to bring such a morbid and potentially upsetting question to the sub, if you aren’t in a spot to read something regarding the death of a dog, GDV/bloat, or are quite sensitive to things of this nature, please dont read on.

I grew up with my Alsatian/GSD mix rescue, Junie, for half my entire life—twelve years old till i was twenty four. she was my absolute best friend in the world, my sister and my guardian angel. her death last year hit me incredibly hard, which is why ive spent the last year debating whether or not I actually want to know the information or answer I’m looking for here. 

she was always a very very healthy girl, and remained active and spirited right up until her last week of life—though she had arthritic back legs which no longer could support her, with my partner and i holding her hind legs in a sling, she ran down the beach chasing her siblings with the biggest smile, just two days before she passed. 

her issue arose quickly and unexpectedly in the form of GDV. I was able to recognise the signs well enough to suspect what it was, and she was rushed to the emergency vet where she had the gas removal procedure under anaesthesia. Though it was a risk due to her age, she went through the procedure just fine and the vet assured us that the bloat had subsided and she would be absolutely fine. We took her home,  put her in her bed next to my side of the bed, and though i did stay awake for an hour or so, i fell asleep around 5AM, with Junie sleeping completely normally beside me (Small shifts and stretches, normal breathing). 

four hours later i woke up suddenly and immediately looked over at her, but saw her unmoving. Id prefer not to expand too much here since it’s difficult for me to recall, emotionally. She had passed away at some point in the last four hours, but from the point of view of medical normalcy, nothing seemed out of the ordinary for what would have been expected. 

my question lies in this—though everything else seemed like a death you’d expect from what were  complications from GDV, there was something which i noticed that always stuck with me. The leg of a nearby chair had been chewed quite badly, and she had bits of the chewed-up chair leg around her mouth. I have always thought it may have been that she was in pain and thats why she chewed on the chair.  it hurt so badly knowing I was asleep when I should’ve been  with her in those moments so she maybe wouldn’t have needed to resort to that, but I just need to know for certain. I’m trying my best to work through the guilt of falling asleep that night and feel like it would at least help me stop wondering  why she did what she did in her final moments. Whether it was pain, fear, or confusion, I want to understand so I can (in some sort of universal way) apologise to her. 

\[I’d also ask that if you feel inclined to be harsh in any criticisms you may have of me/my handling of the situation, please please do your best to mitigate the harshness. I’m self-admittedly incredibly sensitive, and U assure you all I take complete onus for falling asleep that night, trusting the vet implicitly, and not doing something/anything more— that weight has not even slightly subsided a year later.\]

thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope all your dogs are doing incredibly well. If you havent yet, I’d urge you to use this as your sign research signs of GDV and preemptively understand emergency procedures available within your means. And maybe send a lil treat to Junie in heaven, she’s the best girl. ",1,1732068598.0

Working Dog Companion,"    **Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * No, I've owned 3 pitbulls, a husky and 2 chihuahuas- all rescues. I really miss my one dog who loved training- everything from obedience, to scent games, really simple coursing, to basic therapy (cuddle on command).
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    My most recent pitbull had a working dog spirit, high intelligence, combined with extreme affection. If I can find that in a rescue I'm OK with that, but would consider a breeder, especially for decreased risks of health problems.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    High trainability/intelligence, medium energy level, loves obedience training, extremely affectionate, eager to please. Good with people and other dogs. 40-80 lbs. Low maintenance coat
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    I'm fine with finding a pitbull again, but it's just so hard finding what I'm looking for in rescues. It seems really hard to find an ethical pitbull breeder. I'm considering German Shepherds for their trainability but I'm concerned about their health and somewhat their shedding. I'm considering a Dutch Shepherd for trainability but would be looking for as low energy as possible, relative to their breed.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    Basic and advanced obedience, Canine Good Citizen, scent games if they enjoy it. If I found the right dog, training it to provide assistance for emotional distress.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    No, just a stellar companion dog.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    6 hours
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    About an hour per day, it would be combined obedience/informal agility or fetch/walks or runs. No dog parks.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * Open to it all but would prefer low shedding. My husky was crazy upkeep, and I prefer not to deal with that if I can help it.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    40-80lbs
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    Medium shedding or less, barking is fine as long as hearing protection isn't required, some slobber is ok.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    This would be great, I've never had a dog with recall strong enough to trust doing it.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    Extreme snuggler
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    Very eager to please
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    Barking is fine, aggression is undesired. Should be capable of meeting new people without aggression.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    Yeah, but I'd much prefer a dog capable of being around other dogs.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    Strong people reactivity/aggression. Bad separation anxiety. 
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    I hybrid work, when my wife and I are gone, it would be about 8 hours. I can come home on my lunch break on some days.
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    My wife prefers we adopt. She really wants an affectionate dog. She cared for our dogs, including walks, but doesn't do much training.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    No pets.
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * No, just occassionally in public or visiting family.
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * No.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    US, no bans.
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    Summer high upper 80's, Winter high in the 30's
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    We really miss having a dog in the house!
    
    26) Feel free to ask any questions below.
    
    I've never had a dog from a breeder, I can't tell if it's a route we should go, advice requested on adopt vs ethical breeder?
    
    I met the most amazing dutch shepherd, calm but alert, extremely intelligent, good with strangers- good size with a managable coat. I'm wondering, was he just a fluke or can a similar one, toned down enough to be a companion/pet be found?

Cheyenne,"I lost my girl 3 weeks ago and I just needed to share.

Yesterday I got red ferns added to Cheyenne’s paw print tattoo. Inspired by the book, Where the Red Fern Grows, I knew it was something that I would add once I said goodbye each of the animals. Getting the piece done, though, has had a different effect than I thought it would. I thought it would help me feel better… make Cheyenne feel closer somehow. Instead, it makes it final. I know it was final before, but I still expected to see her staring in the window or hear her tail thumping against the wall.

She’s not the first dog I’ve mourned: Delilah, when I was 7; Max, when I was 13; Misty; Sadie; Ranger… And I know that big dogs don’t last long into double digits. So with a 10 year-old and a 12 year old, I’d been trying to prepare myself for the eventual goodbye. I had an idea of what to look out for to signal that it was time and I had a plan for them to go to rest at home. I wanted everyone to be able to say goodbye and for the animals to feel loved.

Cropper is 12 and slower and grayer, while Cheyenne still sprinted and bounced around like a puppy. I thought Cropper would leave me first, so I hugged him just a little tighter and a couple seconds longer. I thought I had more time with Cheyenne.

It was a Wednesday morning when she was unable to walk on her back leg. Poor girl, dragged herself around the house - still trying to sprint to her treats - on just her front legs. Luckily, I was able to get an appointment for her the next morning and in true Cheyenne fashion, she bounced into the vet as if nothing was wrong. In fact the text I sent Husband was, “That bitch walked in there,” at which he laughed. The vet said she looked like she was in great shape and her bloodwork from a few months ago was perfect.

We should have had more time.

Friday we gave her the prescribed pain meds and tried to have her take it easy because she was intermittently having leg issues. No pain meds Saturday and she seemed to be moving normally. Sunday we tried to take her for a walk. Not even a quarter mile from the house, she sat down, obviously not quite ready to go further. As we headed back to the house, I decided to take Cropper around the block thinking, “We should probably get them used to walking separately anyways.” Cropper was getting worn out sooner than Cheyenne on walks and I thought we’d have to shorten his.

We were home just a few minutes later. Husband said he had to carry Cheyenne inside. She was still happy and alert, just relaxing on the floor. I gave her some pain medication and let her rest. Not even an hour later she was seizing. We weren’t sure what was going on and thought it might be a reaction to the medication. We tried to cool her body temperature down and I called an emergency vet, who advised that we bring her in. That ride to the vet was heartbreaking. I know she was scared; I only hope she wasn’t hurting and didn’t feel alone. Husband carried her in. The vet staff performed CPR on her for 8 minutes.

We didn’t get more time.

So now I have these red ferns around my girl’s paw, a broken heart, and the feeling that even for as much as I loved her, I know it wasn’t enough. I thought I had more time. Why did I save any love for later? She deserved so much more than that.

Cheyenne has left a hole so much greater than I imagined it would be. I miss the sound of her chasing the cat or her barking at absolutely nothing in the backyard. I miss being so annoyed by her just staring at me. “Do you want outside? Dinner time? No? You just want lovin’?” That’s all she ever wanted: to love and be loved.

As much as I loved that dog, I should have loved her so much more.

I miss you, my sweet girl. I will always regret falling short of what you deserved.

Dog for the  Future,"I will start off with saying I plan on reaching out to breeders/people with the breeds, but I felt like this was a chance to get more peoples opinions at once.



1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

No, I have owed a sheltie, a husky/border collie mix, and two rough collies. 



2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]

Reputable breeder 



3. Describe your ideal dog.

I want a higher drive dog that is biddable. I would like to continue to compete in rally, fast Cat, and agility. I’ve been training my collies in scent work so I plan on starting to compete next year for that. I would also like to potentially start to do dock diving, and barn hunt as well. I like a medium to long coat that is softer. I tend to love herding breeds. I love my rough collies, but they tend to be a bit lower drive, and I want a dog that can keep up with me more. I like having a dog that I can train how to settle when needed to, but I am decently active between training, playing with dogs, hiking, walking, and competitions. I do not care about barking, my collies are very vocal. And I’ve dog sit dogs that that just scream. The barking or screaming noise has never bothered me. 



4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



I am thinking about a Mudi or a Border Collie. Something about Mudi’s interest me a lot. They overall seem like the entire package. I was looking for a smaller sized (18 inches or smaller) with a higher drive. The low maintenance coat is a plus, but yet they are still furry. I am used to a lot of coat, and having a third dog with a lot of coat I would end up wasting so much time brushing which I already do. The border collie is known for being very biddable and trainable, but honestly bigger than I was originally looking for. The problem with the mudi is I’ve heard a lot of conflicting information on being biddable. Some say they are and easy to train others say prone to reactivity, hard to compete with, and usually unwilling to train. I’ve seen that some mudi do well in multiple different sports too. But also border collies can excel at multiple different sports. 



5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 



Opps sort of already answered this, but looking for a dog I could potentially compete with agility, rally, scent work, barn hunt, fast cat, and dock diving. I also like working on trick titles with my dogs, since it helps to build my dogs learning new things faster the more we problem solve and shape new behaviors. 



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport 



Yes, right now just rally, agility, and fast cat. I am currently on working on scent work with the hopes to start competing next year. My dogs are progressing better than I hoped and so proud of them! I would love to get into some other sports as well such as dock diving  and barn hunt. This is less available in my area so I will need to drive further. But I am excited to try it in the future. 



7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 



Oh my gosh dogs are my life. Besides work I am interacting with them. I have no friends. Well I have one friend who is just as dog crazy as me. Dividing up between my dogs easily like 6-7 hours, between in person classes, training, playing, feeding, enrichment, and walks. 





8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?



As much as they need to be enriched. Again my dogs are my personality. Walking is more for me, but my one dog demands walks at the exact same times every day so they get at least two walks, since that’s what he demands. But sometimes it’s three. No dog parks, yikes. I have fenced in back yard for off leash fun. Hiking, and lots of training, puzzle games or licky mats for a calming behavior. 



9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional? 



Well I do all my own grooming. I have two rough collies, so when I say I groom a lot, I groom a lot. Plus my one rough collie’s favorite activity is to find burr bushes in the forest. Nails and hair between pads get done once a week. Brushing pretty much daily. Cleaning ears when needed. And brushing teeth daily. I do not mind the grooming, but having a lighter coat than a rough collie might be nice. 



10) What size dog are you looking for?



More on the smaller side/medium. Maybe more like 20-40 pound range. My current are 55 pounds and 70 pounds. I have a collie that is half an inch over sized now and a collie just barely meeting standard both male. So I’m looking for something a little smaller and more agile. 



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



Used to shedding, my dogs love to bark, barking does not bother me. Slobber not an issue

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



My county has strict leash laws. No off Leash dogs.



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



I like a snuggly dog, but not a dog that wants to live in my skin. Some of the Aussies I’ve dog sat where they are not happy unless they are practically wearing you. Aussies are a little too clingy. Maybe dial it back by one and I can handle anything from that point and lower 



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I like eager to please 



15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

 I do not care either way if they greet or bark.  If a tendency I am willing to train a place behavior at a young age to prevent issues.



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I do not love the idea, but things happen. I am willing to face whatever happens. I do need a dog that can learn to coexist with other dogs though even if management is needed. 



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I can’t deal with dog that just is completely uninterested in learning new things. 



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



2-3 hours, max 4. I work remote most times, and have set up for them family to be with them when I do work. 



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

No preferences. 



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?



I have two rough collies and a rabbit. I do have a rabbit most of the time he allowed loose in the house. Mudi vs Border collie being with small animals? My rabbit is a larger rabbit and punches the dogs if they get in his face too much. 



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Nope, house with backyard 



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

No, I live in Indiana . The only thing is the city limits I live in do have strict leash laws. 



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Uh winter like 20 F

Summer up to 90 F. I would say summer normally is more like 80 F.

We get all the seasons. But most of the summer is not that hot. 



Anyone that is familiar with Mudi or Border collies I really would love to go with what best fits my life. My friend has a border collie, and I have met more border collies than Mudis, but my biggest concern with Border collies is the higher prey drive, and larger size. I mostly just want a very versatile dog.",1,1730473987.0
Tough Dog Toys?,"Hey everyone! i have a 9 month old doberman mix who loves to chew things. the only issue is i’ve yet to find a toy he hasn’t been able to destroy. i’ve tried almost all the different kinds like crinkle toys, squeaker toys, those balls that when you roll them treats come out, and even the toys that are marketed “tough” at the pet store. somehow he finds a way to destroy them all and i feel bad because i have to end up taking it away so he doesn’t eat it. i was wondering if anyone had any good recommendations on strong toys/chews that they’ve used (that have held up). i live in canada and unfortunately a lot of toys i’ve seen are only available in the US. any suggestions help and thanks so much in advance!

My Friend Overpaid on His Mortgage Due to Hidden Fees Could He Be a Victim of a Mortgage Scam?,"I'm looking for some advice on behalf of a friend who recently went through a rough experience with his mortgage. He was excited about buying his first home, but the process ended up costing him a lot more than he anticipated, and he’s now worried he might have been taken advantage of.

Here’s what happened:

When he first signed up with the lender, he was quoted a certain interest rate and monthly payment. But as he got further into the process, he started seeing additional “administrative fees” and “rate lock fees” pop up, which weren’t discussed upfront. By the time he closed, he had paid thousands more than he originally budgeted for.

He’s also been charged “early payment penalties” for trying to make extra payments toward the principal to pay off the loan faster. He’s feeling frustrated and uncertain if this is standard in the mortgage industry or if he got scammed.

Questions for the community:

1. **Are these kinds of fees normal in mortgage agreements?** What kinds of charges should homebuyers expect, and what should be a red flag?
2. **Can he dispute any of these charges?** Is there any way to request an audit or speak to a consumer protection agency to look into whether he was overcharged?
3. **What steps can he take to avoid these issues in the future?** For those who’ve been through the mortgage process, any tips on spotting hidden fees and negotiating better terms?

He’s feeling pretty discouraged and doesn’t want others to make the same mistakes. Any insights or advice from folks who’ve dealt with similar situations would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",0,1731868802.0
How has spaying changed the character of your female dog?,"
Hello all, 

I have a working line hunting dog from a rare breed. In my country, there is only about 30-40 dogs of this breed, and mine is one of the only 4 females known to the club that could breed. Because of that, I listened to the recommendation of her breeder and the breed club not to spay her yet. My vet also recommended not to spay large dogs unter 2 years of age because of hormones associated to growth. 

Now she is a little over two years. She has had a little problem with resource guarding, but I thought with training I had succeeded at resolving it. There was one single guarding event than at her first heat, than another at her second heat, but since her third heat she seems to be back to resource guarding. 

Now I wonder if spaying would resolve this. Has someone hat a dog that was resource guarding and affected positively or negatively by spaying? Or also if your dog was never guarding at all, how did spaying affect their character?

About health risks I have already read some studies and got information from my vet about elimination of pyometra risk but increased cancer risk. So I think I am informed about that topic already. But I am curious to hear how spaying affected your dogs behavior!

Thanks all!

Edit:

- the das was trained and still is trained against guarding behavior using counter conditioning. The training proved very efficient since there was only one guarding incident until she was more than two years old - a case where she guarded a bone during her first heat. 

- however, now, at two and a half years and during/after her third heat, the behavior has reappeared

- I do not want to spay her to fix her behavior - I know that behavioral problems always require training - instead, I wonder if spaying would make the behavior worse.",1,1729868993.0

Am I over leveraging on my monthly payments?,"In over my head with monthly payments?

Hello Reddit,

I am married, 24 years old, and I’m currently making ~$108,000 annually with RSUs for around $50,000 this year, and an annual bonus of around $10,000. 

Post- tax I take home around 4000 a month with 401k, and closer to $6700 without. 

I recently purchased a home for around ~400k, with a monthly payment of 3100. I was previously renting at 2100. 

Pre-tax 401k - ~$2000

House 7% - $3100 (400k remaining)
car 8% - $860. (39,000 remaining)
Utilities - $500. 
Student loans - $400 (25k remaining)

Unvested RSU value: $175,000

Is this over leveraging? I am afraid with a near 50% contribution to 401k while I will max in June next year for the first few months I will only be making ~4000 a month. 
Also, with kids I’m worrying about starting HSA contributions for daycare from pre-tax money. 

How would you handle your contributions? Is this too much monthly?

Do you have any suggestions for how I can improve my situation?

My priorities are getting out of debt as quickly as possibly so I can enjoy the income, and behind saving seriously without a constant monthly drain on my head. Work is enough. 

Edit: 401k: ~40k
Savings: ~5k

Dog isn’t interested in his food anymore,"I adopted my mini golden doodle almost one year ago and when we first had him he was ravenous when it came to his food. We had to feed him with a slow feeder and only give him quarter portions at a time or else he would throw up. Fast forward to about a month ago, I go to feed him and he would just sniff it and walk away or grab a few pieces, take them to a carpeted area and either drop and leave them there or eat it but leave majority of his food in his bowl. I tried transitioning him to a different food (the same one my mom feeds her dog and he always really liked) and he would eat it better but still leaving at least half when the food is initially put out. I have tried using toppers, wet food to mix in, and even cooked chicken and turkey and he will still never eat all his food in one sitting (he’ll pick out the extra stuff I put in there, sometimes. Other times he’ll sniff it and walk away). I took him to the vet yesterday for his annual checkup and they drew blood and took a stool sample and said everything looked normal. Does anyone have any tips to help him go back to at least eating all his food in one sitting? It’s such an abrupt change from how he was before, it really worries me. ",1,1726453024.0

31 need some advice - Australia,"

Hi everyone, I’m looking for some general advice and help with budgeting as I am 31 and always been terrible with saving. 

I’m an engineer, 3 years into my career and just got a new job where I’ve jumped from 90k/year to 130k/year (plus super) - with HECS I’m netting about $7,300 a month. 

I started my career kind of late and at 28/29 on my first salary I was living in Melbourne and wanted to enjoy having a non-hospitality job and salary so I did not live frugally. I recently moved back to the Gold Coast and had unfortunate car troubles which took all my savings. 

As I have just had a considerable jump in wage, I feel like I am in a position where I can start saving properly and feel like I am quite behind. 

My current financial scenario is:
- 7,300 a month
- $500/week rent
- 10k credit card debt
- 60k HECS debt
- I need to buy a new car and drive about 500km a week
- I am looking at 2 options for cars: 
Option 1: 10k car loan for a 2000-2005 Toyota hilux or Prado that does about 14 litres / 100km
Option 2: 25k-30k car loan for a 2010-2015 Toyota hilux or Prado that does about 8.5 litres/100km
- I have done some analysis and both options work out to have roughly the same monthly cost when you look at loan and fuel consumption - about $800/month
- I also am wondering if it is a good idea to put an extra 10k on the loan to consolidate my credit card debt and cancel the credit card so I have a singular debt to be looking after. 

I am concerned about having such a big loan with Option 2 (around 40k loan) - but it seems silly to be paying the same amount a month for a 20+ year old car. 


Looking for some answers to the following questions:
- What percentage of my income should I be trying to save? Two streams of saving: fun and house deposit
- What percentage of my income should I be trying to budget to for food and expenses?
- is it dumb to get an increased personal loan to consolidate my credit card debt?
- is it dumb to buy a 20+ year old car on a loan?

Dog Weight Issue,"Hello. I am here for recommendations regarding my dog. My girl is due to be 9 on February the 14th. She is a Pomeranian and Fox Terrier Mix. She’s adorable but I have some issues regarding her weight. Now I’ve taken her to a vet (2 different ones) to which they say all tests have come back fine and she has no issues aside from just being overweight that in fact she’s quite healthy including her great dental. To size, she should be 15lbs but she is 20lbs. It’s a lot for her little body. I’ve done years of diet foods, changing foods, cutting her intake. Increased exercise, cut treats down. Etc. I’ve done everything the vet tells me. It always ends back to them saying let’s try this diet food to which never helps. I’m really doing my best to help her lose weight because as she gets older, I know it’s going to weigh down on her joints. Are there any recommendations someone can give me? Has anyone done something that maybe they think I may have not? I’d like to really get my girl into shape. She’s been a great dog to me and deserves the absolute best. ",1,1728260812.0

Buying land with a loan and building a home with my own cash.  Do I need homeowners insurance?,"Greetings,

I live in Florida where home owners insurance is extremely expensive and so is the hosing market in general.  Fingers crossed for the market to come down in 2025...

I will soon be in the market for a home and am interested in buying a more rural area of south Florida.  
I am considering Agricultural land because I like farming and gardening etc.  

One scenario Im thinking about that I'd like clarity on in regards to Home Owner insurance.

Scenario  
\- Purchase an Agricultural land with a USDA loan.  
\- Build a house on this land with my own money.  
Since I built a house on land that is financed, will that mortgage require home owner insurance even though the house is fully paid for???

Help: 401K vs. Saving for a House?,"**Question**: Is it irresponsible/unwise to **temporarily** lower HSA and 401K contributions to save for a house in my current situation?  I know the common advice to never touch this--is this a situation where it makes sense to do this?  Conservatively (i.e., not counting any bonuses) if I stopped contributing for 3 years, I would have as much saved as I wanted to have for down payment + reserved savings.  More likely (i.e., based on low-end of bonuses previously received) if I stopped contributing for 2 years, I would have as much as I wanted to have saved.  Add 2 years to each time estimate with no change to contributions.

**Sorry in advance for the long post...really just don't know what to do.  Any and all advice/experience is greatly appreciated.**

**Current Situation**:  In a HCOL area.  Max out HSA and 401K IRS contribution limits; save/invest 27-30% of monthly budget + all stock grants/bonuses; rent is 25% of monthly budget; student loans are 13% of monthly budget; car payment 7% of monthly budget.  ""Monthly budget"" = 2 paychecks, post-tax/withholdings/HSA/401K contributions, so there are 2 ""extra"" paychecks per year that are saved/invested/put towards student loans.  Stock grants and bonuses after taxes = about 18% of annual salary and are saved/invested/put towards student loans.  Don't carry a balance on credit cards. 

I support both myself and my spouse, who hasn't had success job hunting/hasn't had steady employment to reliably contribute to shared recurring expenses since getting an MBA.  Goal is to pay essentially all expenses with one salary (my salary for now or forever, tbd).  We want children in the next year, so  goal would be to save most of my spouse's future income/use it to pay for childcare, or if spouse is unemployed, they'll be the primary caregiver even though that's not exactly what we want/planned.

Like so many others, I've been saving but cost of the houses/areas we're interested in have run up faster than I could save over the past couple years.  Prices are starting to normalize a bit, but they're still quite high.  It seems that we won't be able to have an affordable monthly payment without putting at 20% down, given the interest rates and increasing home insurance costs (plus high property taxes in our area).  

Our apartment is well-priced, but the location is beginning to wear on us (me especially).  My new car has dents and scratches from other careless tenants parking crooked in the lot and hitting whoever is next to them with their car door, there's been a notable increase in crime in the area in the past year, hallways constantly smell like weed and garbage, terrible to go for walks as it's on a main commercial road, and it's hard for me to justify paying more for a 2BR apartment with these conditions. At that point, I'd rather ""go for broke"" and really stretch our budget just to have some peace and be paying into an asset (but I won't actuallyyy do that, hence wanting to beef up down payment/reserve savings...).  The school system in our current town is also not good, but the towns around us where we'd like to buy are excellent.  Also, if my spouse does find employment, we would want to employ an au pair for childcare, which would require being able to provide them with at least their own room, if not their own bathroom.  If we have kids while renting, we will need to pay for daycare which can be more expensive than au pairs in our area, and will also make it more difficult to continue being a 1-car family (which we want to be).   

**Other Info**: I'm pretty disciplined when I create a savings goal--there's really no ""fear"" that I'd plan to save money and that I'd end up spending it.  I don't like the idea of borrowing from my 401K for a down payment because of the rules about paying it back and how changing jobs could affect paying it back.  ",0,1731955296.0

Picky eater,"Hi everyone, hope you are all doing well!

I have an 8-year-old medium-sized dog (22kg) who’s super picky about her food. We’ve tried all kinds of kibble—different brands, flavors, etc.—but it always ends with us having to hand-feed her, which isn’t great for either of us. Recently, she started having some tummy issues, so we switched to Royal Canin Gastrointestinal vet food. She loved it, and the small kibble size was perfect for her.

But here’s the problem: it has fish oil in it, and she’s intolerant to it. After a while, it builds up in her system, and she starts getting reflux.

I’m at a loss because I can’t seem to find a small-kibble, sensitive-stomach food that doesn’t contain any kind of fish oil.

Financial advisor sold and bought stock without permission,"I had asked my FA to transfer all positions in one of my accounts that is currently managed into one of my accounts that is not managed. I did that on Monday. He was not happy and tried to make a case why I should not. We decided to talk on Friday which we did and I had a few more follow-up questions which he answered.

Today, I see that he traded positions in that exact account YESTERDAY, the day we talked! No mention on the phone, no asking me if I want that! In the past, he ALWAYS confirmed with me!

Given that I asked to move positions into unmanaged account should be obvious indication alone that I would NOT AGREE with selling/buying of stuff by him.

On top, he bought some stocks that I was planning to sell at a loss. Now I cannot do that or it would be a wash sale (for 30 days). He also created about $10k of long term gains which I now have to pay taxes on. My plan was to harvest about $6k in losses but I no longer can do that (wash sale). So overall I am worse $16k long term gains which are now taxable.

So, not only can I no longer use the losses on the account, he created more gains!

What can I do? Can I make him/the company pay for this?

Pretty sure my dog refused to play with a doll because he mistook it for a real human,"My dog loves to shred/disembowel/dismember stuffed animals.  I have a Joe Exotic costume this year for halloween, but because I'm a lady people assumed I'm dressed as Carole Baskin.  I decided to just roll with it and decided a good addition to my costume would be a ""husband"" that I fed to tigers (ex. a dismembered doll stuffed inside of a tiger purse). I got a doll (think American girl doll) from the thrift store and decided I could have it mauled and dismembered by a ferocious beast (my dog of course).

When I give the doll to my dog, he just kinda looks at it and goes ""meh"".  I figured he probably didn't recognize it as a toy.  So I tried to shake it around, make it exciting, etc. He was interested and  started to play, but then stopped, sniffed over the doll, looked really uncomfortable and just sat off to the side and gave me weird side-eye.  My boyfriend pointed out ""um, he thinks that's a real person"" and I think he was right. The more I tried to get my dog to play, the more he was sniffing and nudging at the doll's face and hands until he gave me this look of ""nah mom, I ain't about this, you're on your own"" and sat in a corner.  It wasn't unit I snipped into the doll with scissors and showed him it was made out of stuffing that he started playing with it, then happily mauled it like the ferocious toy-destroying monster he is.

On a completely unrelated note: my dog asks me for permission before shredding up a toy.  It's really cute.  He'll bring it to me and drop it on the floor and just stare at me.  If I say ""go ahead"", the massacre will commence; if I say ""sorry buddy, that's not yours"" he'll leave it alone even when unsupervised.

I have savings aside and this money(4K) can sit as long as it needs to.

I (British) was just paid in cash in USD while on a business trip. What best to do?,"Hello, possibly a silly question I'm overthinking.

I'm from the UK and recently travelled to the US for a business trip. My client, who normally pays me via transfer for remote work, decided to give me a giant (to me) handful of cash (USD) instead. (It's not that crazy, low 4 figures, but more than I'm used to).

I'm a bit nervous just having it about my person, but not quite clear on what the best course of action is to pay it into my British bank account. Should I go to a bank here (pretty sure they don't have an HSBC in this town), or should I hold onto it and pay it in when I get back?

Looking for a medium-small dog,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Second dog. We had a family dog (bichon) that I trained to know commands and tricks, walk and care for whenever I am home (it was always my parents' dog so it was never a question of taking him with me when I moved out)

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)

Not really. I would much rather adopt if possible.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

Can be left alone for 6 hours a day when fully grown. Doesn't have separation anxiety. I live near a lake so love of water would be a plus. Low shed

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Cocker Spaniel but I'm concerned about the shedding. Jack Russel Terrier. Mini Schnauzer. Medium poodle. I like that they are (minus the Jack) semi active dogs afaik, slightly athletic, intelligent.

Biking along would be a dream but I will settle for him/her joining me outdoors for hikes, rollerblading, swimming, walking.

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

About 3 hours during the week, definitely more on weekends and days off.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

I can definitely do 2 hours of exercise, constantly. Walking, hiking, swimming, exploring around, tossing a ball around (I play tennis and I can def take the dog to my training and set him up with an automatic ball launcher, stuff like that). I intend to incorporate him into most of my activities, whenever safe and possible for the dog.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Grooming is no problem, the family bichon needs plenty of that and in between oficial cuts, I am the one keeping her trimmed (paws, face). I am willing to both pay and help maintain in between appointments.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium small.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I would rather not bark down the building. How to greet visitors: politely, I will teach it not to jump on people.

No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Separation anxiety.

**Lifestyle**

During the week, once it is old enough (near adulthood), around 6-7 hours.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

I live alone but have family and friends nearby to help when needed (vacations, if I for some reason would be later than 6 hours and so on)

Fish.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

I do want a child safe dog.

N/A

Context: I was raised religious and taught all about tithing and nothing else.

Starting over completely from scratch in personal finances during medical struggles. Ideas and suggestions are very much welcomed!,"Hello Reddit! Long time reader, first time poster. Yikes, I'm so nervous...

Where do I even start? I want to be concise, but fear this will end up being extremely scatterbrained with seemingly unrelated questions. Please bear with me.

My husband recently let me in on a little secret of his: over $30k in various debts. We had assorted debts 10 years ago, and I was under the assumption these were all taken care of (minus my student loans). About 5 years ago I had a severe mental breakdown which left me hospitalized, and have been in intensive therapy (2+ times weekly) ever since. He had told me not to worry about finances so that I could focus on healing. At the time of my hospitalization, we had already been working steadily on our finances so when he told me not to focus on it, I assumed things were still going in the right direction. Yes, yes, I know what 'assuming' does, and I'm not proud of it. I already feel like an absolute fool! \*cue tears\*

At the time of aligning our finances 10 years ago, we sold a lot of our things (spare items, duplicates, collector's editions, kitchenware,  tools, etc...) to go toward an emergency fund and start the snowball process. We downsized our living arrangements, sold the second car, and he even got a promotion that transferred us to a lower-cost-of-living state. As of right now I still do not know the full extent of our current situation (context: the last time a huge stressor happened, hubby ended up in the hospital with Bell's Palsy induced by the stress. My goal right now is to do as much damage control as I can without triggering another paralytic episode, which is frustrating because this is incredibly important information for me to have, but not so important as to risk his life again). No, I don't know what exactly these debts paid for, nor do I care to find out. I have a feeling they are in part to my medical bills, in part to inflation, and in part to our diets having changed for less takeout. But the fact of the matter is that it is here now and it is no use of me to dwell on the ""should ofs"" and ""could ofs"" of past circumstances. I am well aware that the first thing I need to do is get all the information, which I will have by the end of the week.

Okay, on to our dilemma. He wants to take out a loan to pay back these various debts. My concern is that our income-debt ratio will not allow us to do this, plus I'm certain any application we put in will be flagged as high risk. I want to go back to a sort of 'snowball' method because that seemed to work decently enough for us the last time, but last time I was also employed and this time we have no 'extras' to sell off. I don't want him overly stressing about figuring how to get out of this hole, I'm home 24/7 and the very least I can do is try to figure this out for us. However, I'm grabbing at straws with such limited information and have absolutely no clue as where to begin. I'm open to ideas, even if it's something I've already tried. Maybe you'll have a approach that has not yet crossed my mind.

On to my dilemma. (This is starting to feel like a pity-party, and I'm getting off my own topic... Shame on me, but I'm going to write this out anyway if only to get off my chest...) My therapist and doctors don't want me working yet. ""When?"" I asked. ""In another 4-7 years."" 7 years! In this economy? With our current circumstances? Absolutely not! I need to figure out a way to help support our household outside of domestic duties. I am furious with myself for not having been able to contribute financially, and their telling me 'no' is only fueling my rage. I use to work as a physical rehab therapist and did retail on the side. Both were very physically demanding jobs that required hearing, which I am no longer capable of. So remote work it is. However, from what I can tell remote work has decreased immensely over the past two years. What few remote jobs I've seen are looking for roles that are way out of my league, or they are call centers which I would not be able to hear the caller. My biggest concern in finding remote work is that I would need to go back to school and take out atrocious loans to even begin to be qualified for these roles. If I want a remote job, then I need to learn more about technology based things. I learned how to type on a ribbon typewriter back in middle school, and learned Excell and other Microsoft programs in college. I can currently touch-type 90 wpm, and I use Inkscape in my hobbies. This is the extent of my up-to-date computer knowledge. I feel that these computer skills are now obsolete (especially with how quickly things change), and silly me didn't keep up with computers as it was not my career focus. I've no idea where to begin looking into learning a new tech skill. Is there even tech work that doesn't require a degree? Can tech things even be self-taught? I am very good at teaching myself new things, but I will only ever be as good as the sources my information comes from.

So, Reddit. I guess my questions to you here are two-fold: does anyone have insight where/how to begin balancing finances when starting over from scratch? does anyone have insight where/how to pursue a remote position for someone with hearing loss?

Thank you for your time!

My dog is terrified of ear medication and I feel so guilty. Any tips or guidance?,"Got my rescue pup around three years ago (\~5.5 years old, 17lbs, chihuahua mix (possibly w/ dachshund?)), and she is petrified of getting ear drops (this medication is in a syringe, so it's just one ""push"" per ear)

She won't be distracted by high value treats, lick mats, etc. during these moments. Even vets and vet techs have been shocked at how scared she gets and how hard she fights back (never to hurt, just to get away). She was once given calming medicine to get an ultrasound and had to be sedated twice because her anxiety was so high she just fought through it the first time.

The vet recommended my boyfriend hold her and I do the syringe, but she's secretly a tank and wrestles out of the hold every time. We sing, baby talk, give scritches, hold treats, spread cheese/PB on a mat, the whole nine yards -- and she is hyper-focused on running away and ended up ass-up in my boyfriends arms and scratched his neck with her hind legs. Last night, after half an hour trying to get the medication in, she pooped a little bit while trying to run away (which she has never, ever done out of fear before) and I broke down crying and couldn't do it anymore, I felt so bad. My boyfriend tried to sneakily put them in while she was dozing off later and she must have smelled it, because she woke up and squirmed away. 

I feel absolutely *horrendous* for making her so scared. I feel like I'm retraumatizing her and am kicking myself for being such a terrible owner. And I know the best thing is to make her happy and do it while she's distracted or otherwise, but none of the distracting methods have worked because even when we've desensitized her to us touching her ears, she's SO hyperaware of what we're doing when it comes down to medication time. It's like she has a sixth sense for it when we hide it behind our backs, up our sleeves, pre-placed under a blanket near her basking spots, etc. 

**My question is: How do y'all do ear medication with super anxious dogs??**


Update: Thank you all SO much for your responses!! They’ve all been so genuinely helpful and I’m relieved to have some tips I can employ later as well, once we get through this course of meds and can get her desensitized to the syringe more in general. Thank you all again so so much!! I really, truly appreciate it.",1,1730227319.0

Getting divorced. Need help with the split.,"My wife and I are slowly, amicably planning our divorce at the end of this year.

I need help with ideas on how to do this split.

Background:

Married 17 years. We've contributed to my retirement SEP IRAs, but she has a school counselor job which will not bear fruit in retirement (came to it late).

We have about $950k in various IRAs. We have a house we paid $239k in 2007 at top of the market. I have a previous house that is a rental worth about $165k. We owe about $225 total on both houses. I make about $201k/year, plus $25k-40k extra by working my vacation time. She makes about $60k.

I'm keeping the houses. She wants to get an apartment and work out her three-year contract, then move and purchase a house closer to family and friends.

She doesn't want the houses, but suggested $300k cash, and $1000/month alimony for five years. I agreed.

Here is my problem -- how do I give her $300k cash without taking a tax penalty for removing it from an IRA? I can borrow against my $275k in my TSP (government IRA). I can take home equity loans against the houses.

Ideas? I know we need a financial advisor, a lawyer, or both in order to navigate the tax problems here.

Seeking Advice for Moving In with My Girlfriend Next Year,"Hi everyone,

My girlfriend and I are planning to move in together in October of next year. We’re both ready to take this step and could technically move in as early as next month, but we’ve decided to take this extra year to save and prepare while we’re living rent-free.

I wanted to reach out to this community for advice or tips on navigating this transition, especially in terms of financial preparation. We’re committed to being as ready as possible for this move and ensuring it’s a smooth process.

I’ve heard about something called “bank certification” but am not entirely sure what it entails or if it’s relevant in our situation. I also currently have a high-yield savings account to grow our funds, but I’d love to know if there are other financial tools or strategies we should be considering.

Beyond finances, any general tips or advice for cohabitation, setting up a home together, or things to plan for in advance would be greatly appreciated.

Best grass for the runners!,"Not sure what flair to tag this under.

Start new job now or wait until 401k fully vests?,"Hi everyone,

I'm facing a decision and could use some advice to figure out which option would be best for. I recently received a job offer from a competing company with two possible start dates: **January, 2025**, or **June, 2025**. The new job comes with a 50% raise in base salary: 80k->120k.

At my current company, my 401k will fully vest on June.. by then this will amount to around $14k in only **employer contributions.**

If I start my new job in January and try and recover by maximizing my contributions, I will still be 5k behind by June.

This is where I'm at a predicament.

Is it worth waiting to start a new job for 5k in a 401k?

On one hand, im in my early 20s so I feel like that 5k have potential to grow into a sizeable amount by the time I retire.

On another hand, it might be best for my career to start the new job as soon as possible...

How do I entertain a dog that only likes his owners? ,"I dogsit for my friends occasionally and they have a small poodle. He’s a couple years old but has a lot of health issues. About once a week, I’ll head over to hang out with the dog for an hour or so. His owners feel bad leaving him alone all day so they can work. I’m not used to small dogs. I used to have two big dogs and they liked going on walks and playing with toys. This dog, Joey, doesn’t really like doing stuff with me. He hates walks. He doesn’t have many toys and he keeps taking them and hiding them upstairs. I’ll chase him around the house which he seems to like but the house isn’t very big and I don’t want to accidentally break anything. I’d play with him outside if he didn’t gag when I try to put his harness on. One of my dogs used to only really love cuddling but Joey doesn’t like that either. I can pet him for a couple minutes and then he’ll move to a different place and move again if I follow him. He really just lies on the couch. I feel bad that I don’t do more with him but he doesn’t like me like he likes his owners. I think he just tolerates having me around.

Thoughts on leasing vehicles as a luxury expense,"I’d love some thoughts on this - to clarify, I’m not looking for anyone to confirm my thinking or talk me out of it, I’m just curious how others would approach this.

My business has done fantastically well in recent years, with my income going from under $30k in 2019 to well over six figures this year and the last few years. I have been cautious to not inflate my lifestyle but at this point I want to spend some of that money on things that I want.

I got my finances together partially by listening to Dave Ramsey, and he is against any way of using a vehicle that does not involve buying it in cash. I think this is great advice for people struggling with money, or if you look at it from a purely practical standpoint.

The big caveat is that I am looking at this as a luxury expense, not a practical expense. I don’t “need” a nicer car but I want one lol and I can easily afford it. Practical advice would say that’s fine, but pay cash. 

My pushback is that I want a new vehicle every few years, and I don’t view vehicles as an asset because their value goes down so quickly and drastically in most cases. I got burned by buying a $30k used car at the peak of Covid-era used car inflation that is now worth under $15k.

All that is to say, I’m failing to see the downside to leasing a vehicle under the following assumptions:

1. I have no other debt
2. I am saving and/or investing 25% of my income
3. I have enough cash reserves to pay off the lease and buy a used car cash in a worst-case scenario
4. I understand that this is purely a luxury purchase and the money spent is never coming back to me
5. I don’t plan on keeping the vehicle for more than three years

Please help me choose my second dog. [Breeds],"
 **Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No. I’ve had an ACD mix for over a year, since she was 5 months old. I also volunteer at my local ACC weekly working with lots of different types of dogs in the play yard. I’m not an expert by any means, but I have picked up some stuff. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Nope! Either is okay with me. My current dog is from a shelter.



3) Describe your ideal dog.

* A snuggle bug, if possible. I tend to lean towards semi-velcro dogs. I do a lot of walking/hiking in the summer months, so a dog that can go several miles in a day. However, where I live it gets extremely cold in the winter, so conversely I need a dog that isn’t gonna lose its mind when we’re doing mainly indoor enrichment for 5 months out of the year. Low prey drive, as I have cats. One thing I really like about my ACD mix is how much she seems to have going on in her little head. She’s really smart and has a lot of personality. She’s also kind of sassy, which I do honestly enjoy. 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I’ve always wanted a German Shorthaired Pointer, but that’s mainly because they look really cool and I love it when they point. I don’t actually know if they fit what Im looking for. I have considered a lab because I’ve read a lot of stories in which they pair really well with ACDs. I also love bully mixes, but will admit I am fearful of bringing home one. Just because I have cats. I’ve loved all of the bully mixes i’ve worked with at the shelter, but a good majority of them could only go to cat-free homes. I also have been looking into medium-sized spaniels, selfishly based off of aesthetics alone. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Off-leash training is a big one. I do a lot of road tripping/hiking/camping. My current dog is still not to be trusted off leash on hikes, but I know I can let her off leash to potty at a rest stop, or when we’re at the beach, and she won’t run off. Swimming! I love to swim, my current dog loves to swim. I don’t do any sports or anything with my dogs. Just a lot of outdoor activities.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Not necessarily, no. I’ve always been interested in dock-diving and agility, but I’m not invested in it. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

*5 hours a day on work days, longer on days i have off. i’m not a super social person, so, my dog is my hobby. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I walk about 3.6 miles a day after work with my current dog. Distance from my house to the river park and back. On days I have off in the summer, we do the beach and swimming. In the winter it gets super cold here, so we do short walks and fetch in the yard. On days that’s not possible we do snuffle mats and indoor fetch. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* As much as necessary. My current dog sees a groomer regularly, and that groomer is 2 blocks from my house. I have no limitations as far as grooming needs or budget. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium/large-ish. 40-70 lbs. I’m small and I need a dog I can carry in case of emergency or injury on hikes. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding isn’t a problem. I don’t need a silent dog, but I don’t necessarily want husky level vocal, either. Slobber kind of grosses me out, so the less the better. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* important. we do a lot of road tripping/camping. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly, but it doesn’t have to be attached to my hip, either. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Somewhere in between? 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Prefferably with minimal barking. Limited agression. I would like my dog to be on the friendlier side. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. I have a dog currently in my home and i’m not willing to keep them entirely separate. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Agression towards cats. I know that’s also a training issue, but some breeds obviously have larger prey drives. Resource guarding. Escape artists. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work 7-9 hours in a day, but my mom or a friend drop in on my dog around noon for 30 mins. On my days off, I usually am out of the house for 2-4 hours. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I am the only person in the house. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have a female ACD mix who is almost 2, and 4 cats. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No children live in the home, but a lot of my family members have small children. This would only really be an issue on the holidays, but even then I can separate if need be. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent currently. There are no breed or weight restrictions in place. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Allen County, IN. Yes, I’m aware. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* summer avg is 74F, winter avg is 22.9.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I truly have no breeds that I’m set on or leaning towards, so recommend anything! I also am in no rush to get my second dog, so feel free to hit me with hard to come by breeds as well. 

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

"Debating using a credit card for big ticket aesthetics purchases to immediately pay off, rarely","Hi all! I have a credit score in the high 700s and am unsure if my thinking makes sense credit-wise.

I'm debating getting a credit card for rare use for large aesthetic transactions, as follows.

I have the funds for what I'm interested in doing, but hoped to use a credit card as the payment method, then immediately pay off the transaction in full, and am unsure which credit card would be best for such a purpose - for cash back or related rewards purposes.

I don't know if putting such a large expense is counterproductive credit wise, or if the immediate pay-off in full affords more upside than any small hit for putting a large balance on the card.

I don't travel much so I'm avoiding Travel/ miles credit card ideas. I get seemingly good credit card offers but hadn't joined any of them as this is a niche, random strategy.

I have three credit cards now, the longest one is Golden 1 Credit Union's cashback card with a $15K limit so maybe I'm better off doing this on that card?

Any and all advice appreciated - I also posted this to the Plastic Surgery subreddit.

I would like to do a large expense say $2-6k once to twice per year, and pay off the full balance immediately once the transaction processes. 

I have the money to pay outright and am very unclear putting the expense on the card, and immediately paying off the card, confers any advantage with respect to my credit score. Thanks in advance!",0,1732469761.0
Looking for new and creative enrichment ideas,"I am constantly trying to find new enrichment that my dog can do. He’s very happy working for his toys and food with our current activities, but I want to expand what we do. When I turn to the internet to find new ideas, most of it is the same: puzzle toys, lick mats, kongs. Those are great for some dogs but he doesn’t get a whole lot out of it. I am usually very creative with this but I am stuck atm and want to see if anyone has something we could try out. **I wanna focus on engagement, building up and reducing arousal level, strengthening our bond, and independent problem solving.** 

some information about him: He is a senior german shepherd mix. he’s still very active but because of his age, I obviously want to avoid anything high impact. he reacts to bikes and joggers (but has improved so much since we got him), and I don’t know if that’s relevant but I figured I’d add that. He is highly intelligent and gets bored easily, so I am looking for something with a bit of a higher level of difficulty. when we are inside, he seems uncomfortable doing these activities, when either him or I, are standing or moving around. We don't know anything about his life before we got him, but we think he was confined to a small kennel, and overall wasn’t treated well. so he does most enrichment activities on the floor, except for tearing apart boxes and newspaper, scent work, and when I throw a treat across the room and recall him. 

What we already do that works:

* scent work and scatter feeding
* fetching, herding, and racing to basketballs
* loose leash walking and skill practice on a long lead
* walks specifically for sniffing and exploring-around our neighborhood and wooded areas, and walks more focused on obedience 
* tearing apart boxes and newspaper
* free shaping: resting his head on the ground, stepping up on a platform (I really want to do more free shaping exercises)
* obstacle courses
* relaxing outside of our property and observing surroundings (still working on)

What hasn’t worked, not interested in:

* retrieving objects
* playing with toys, other than basketballs, outside
* flirt poles
* he breaks most puzzle toys 
* rolling food up in a towel
* anything that involves him getting wet, unless it’s with the hose

I know this is very limiting but I figured I’d see if anyone has any ideas.

TLDR, left the country (US) in 2022, came back with ex who destroyed my credit by not making payments on a card that was in my name. Needed my own personal vehicle, bought a 2016 Chevy Spark LT manual. Loan totaled to 11k from Carvana. Been making base payments since 2023, with $1377 principal paid ($291/month).

I have a costco citibank CC, and it appears I have coverage up to $50k (the cars I rent are worth $20k max), and there seems to be no OOP costs for me for up to that amount regardless of who's at fault. This insurance always works as primary when outside the US, so it'll work in Greece.

How much house can I afford?,"Hi!  I’m 22, my husband is 23.  We currently have a home that we bought for 134,000 and we owe 78,605.  I make roughly 45,000/yr and he makes 52,000 without overtime (71,500 after overtime).  We owe 60,000 on a truck (his work truck).  We have 15,000 in savings, and our monthly expenses are usually a little under 5000/month.  (Including groceries, gas, etc).  We typically have around 2,000/month left over.  We are wanting to move, but not sure how much home we could afford.  We bought our first house when my husband was making less than me.  Our incomes have both increased since then, and we have put a lot of money into fixing up our current home.  Assuming we could get 145,000 for our current home, what could we afford?

Crate training dog ,"I have a six-month-old Eskimo, and overall, he’s been easy to crate train. Once he’s in, he doesn’t cry, and he doesn’t whine in the morning to be let out either. The challenge I’m facing is actually getting him into the crate. He’ll happily run into his crate when I feed him his meals, and sometimes during the day, I can say ‘crate,’ and he’ll go in, and I’ll reward him. However, at night, he refuses to go in, even for high-value treats. Based on my research, dogs are supposed to love their crate if you train them correctly, but he doesn’t seem to enjoy it. He doesn’t go in during the day or for naps. I’ve tried giving him high-reward treats, all his meals, and enrichment activities in the crate, I have tried the cover to make it den that, it’s comfy in there I do training games with the crate and crate him even when I’m home so he doesn’t associate crate with me being gone but he still refuses to go in and it’s a 20 minute struggling trying to trick him to go in at night or when leaving for the day. Any tips?

Advice on owning an aggressive dog in apartment building ,"I’ve never been on Reddit before but I’m desperate for advice. Has anyone dealt with a human aggressive dog? I’m a 24 year old female living in a studio apartment in Los Angeles. About 6 months ago I rescued a 50lb Shepard husky mix. The rescue told me he was friendly and ready to be with a FAMILY. However, 6 months later and I’m now dealing with a very aggressive dog. It’s odd though because he gets aggressive if people are in my apartment or car. If we are outside walking he doesn’t bark, growl or pay any mind to other humans OR DOGS. If I am stopped or sitting at a table outside and someone approaches, he will lunge and growl. He lunges at people walking in the apartment building. What’s weird is if we are outside and another person has a dog, he has NO issue with the human. He loves on the human.
I’ve done group training classes and recently had my first one on one session with an amazing trainer. It was so intense that my dog ripped off both dew claws from trying to get his muzzle off. To be clear I do my ABSOLUTE best for this dog. I know his triggers so I’m very cautious of entering/exiting the building. I feel so exhausted and desperate for advice. I love this dog so much.

That said, if there’s a great fit among rescue dogs, we’d be happy to consider a small poodle-mix.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* We’re looking for a dog with basic obedience and minimal excessive barking. (We understand that training and socialization are key factors in managing behavior.)

* Not important

Breed Recommendation ,"1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, I’ve had two dogs as an adult. I had a French bulldog from 1-8 who came into my home due to my friend being given him and her being in a situation she had to move from her pet friendly home. A few years later, I had a mix(GSD, collie and Mastiff and some other breeds I’m forgetting)for a few years. Unfortunately my dad was dog sitting my dog and he got out of his yard and got hit by a car. I had them both crate trained and with good recall. I also grew up around my sister training dogs to be able to go to old folks homes and such as emotional support dogs.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I personally would be fine with rescue but my wife is a bit hesitant as this would be her first dog as an adult and not sure she’s ready for the potential of a dog with special needs or trust issues etc that can come with a rescue. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Will come with us on hikes, walks, outdoor adventures, camping and all that which we do a good bit of but still can hang out at home when we are on down time. Medium sized at least and lovable. Don’t need a serious or intense dog like say a Shiba or Belgian(even tho I love them both as breeds).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

A good ol lab, or golden quite often. I love pretty well all dogs but I am always drawn to their overall demeanours. I do love frenchies still after my last one passed away but they just aren’t great for keeping up in a consistent outdoors setting. Also love a GSD, Mastiffs of various forms and mutts. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Just be a normal average dog. Good recall, fetch, normal basic commands, crate trained. Sure some fun tricks are great but it’s not something I NEED them to do.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

As much as I can. My wife and I often work different shifts so we both would likely get upwards of 5-6 hours a day with the dog. Unless we both quit our jobs which seems like the only correct answer.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

2 hours or so, likely would be a bit more but I live near a very big park so often we go out to just go for a long walk around. Dog parks yes if the dog likes them. Just depends.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Fine with brushing regularly, cleaning ears, trimming nails. If for some reason the dog didn’t like having some of the more jarring things done like nails or what have you, I don’t mind paying someone. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

A barky or mouthy dog wouldn’t be ideal… obviously every dog has their noises and barks sometimes but a husky would be out. As for slobber and shedding, I don’t mind it, while less is better in the shedding department, it’s an accepted thing.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not really.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please and hang out 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Yes to greeting them. I don’t want people to be nervous around my dog because of how it reacts to people knocking on the door.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I personally don’t mind it but I don’t think my wife would be good with handling that as much.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Nothing really else. I’m aware any dog can adopt certain personality traits and it is what it is. Obviously try my hardest to keep it socialized to both humans and other animals but yeah. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Regularly for 6ish hours. I can bring dog to work however at this time so likely less but if I wasn’t able to, it would be that much. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Similar to mine but just a bit more hesitant with dogs having their issues prior and not it being much harder to deal with later in life(a rescue versus a young trainable pup).

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Rent yes, but no restrictions.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Vancouver Canada.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Warm and humid and sunny in the summer, wet and rainy and mild in the winter. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Very open to other breeds not mentioned prior in the other answers as long as they are medium sized or larger. I’ve gotten along with every dog I’ve had the pleasure of meeting, dog sitting or spending time with and appreciate all shapes and sizes.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

Do dogs enjoy running around both the yard and house combined?,"Apologize for the weird question, but it's something that has been bothering me for a while. I've bought a house some time ago (still waiting for it to finish construction, so not moved in yet) but I'm having some doubts now. It's a row house with a small garden - about 35m2 (376 sq ft google tells me), and the ground floor of the house is roughly 45m2, combined it's about 17x5 meters, 7x5 meters (22x16 feet if I calculate correctly) for the garden (I don't live in the US so it's probably a tad different than you guys are used to, but regardless). My doubts pertain to the fear that this small garden will not be enough for my Yorkie to do any running around or zoomies, but hopefully keeping the door to the garden open should allow her to use the full 17 meters. What are your experiences with dogs running into and from the garden to home back again? Do dogs enjoy that?",1,1730638600.0

What dog breed would fit my lifestyle best?,"    *Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * First time I will be the primary one responsible for the dog, my family had a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (Toller), got him when I was 2 and he passed away when I was 14. RIP Bourbon you were the best. A family member was very involved with dogsitting and dog training, so I grew up with that too.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * I'm not 100% decided on this, I'm not opposed to rescues but I think for my first dog it's probably wiser to go through a breeder, also as the adult size is fairly important.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * Four-legged best friend that goes everywhere, is up for anything I am. Cuddly and loyal. Friendly to other people at least to some degree. Well trained. Not anxious or agressive. Everything from cuddling on my lap to hiking and boating (dog does not have to enjoy swimming, though.) Not overly afraid of things. Let's be honest, it will probably be wearing cute sweaters in the winter.
    I'm not really sure how to explain my ideal dog but hopefully you get the idea.
    Small, cute, cuddly, big personality, travel and adventure buddy.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * I liked the Toller I grew up with. Have always liked herding dogs, especially border collies and australian shepherds. I like toy australian shepherds aside from the ethical issues of breeding them. Definitely not getting a big dog, A herding dog probably isn't right for me at the moment I need more of a companion. maybe when I'm older a herding dog will join the family. Currently considering a Papillon?
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Aside from obedience, and tricks for fun-
    I'm a small plane pilot, I would like it to get used to flying with me. Also intend to do a lot of traveling and outdoor adventures. 
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * No.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * Whatever is necessary. I have a fairly flexible schedule, and would like my dog to be well-trained, both with obedience and fun things as well. 
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * No dog park. I am a fairly active person, I walk about two miles around my neighborhood most mornings, enjoy hikes from time to time, go backpacking/camping occasionally, etc. I'm open to a combination of the dog exercising with me, and carrying the dog if/when necessary on longer excursions.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * Brushing is not an issue, I already have to brush my cats quite a bit. Don't mind the occasional trim, but I don't really want a dog that requires full haircuts. Cleaning ears, trimming nails, brushing teeth, anything else I may be forgetting at the moment, not a big deal. I bathe dogs for extended family every once in a while, would not mind doing it on a regular basis. Honestly kind of enjoy it, especially if the dog isn't overly terrified.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Small. Under 20 pounds. I travel a decent amount to visit family, and for fun. I would like to bring the dog with me, definitely in-cabin, fees/complications aren't a huge issue.
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * Minimal-moderate shedding is fine. Barking doesn't bother me, although I will spend some time training to avoid the dog bothering others. Would prefer to keep the slobber to a minimum if at all possible.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * No preference. Would like to off-leash train them if possible but it's not a deal breaker.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Snuggly, but they don't HAVE to be in my space 24/7 if they don't want to.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * More on the side of eager-to-please, but I can work through a bit of stubbornness.
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * Barking is fine, it doesn't bother me in small dogs especially, but again would aim for training them to stop on command. Not agressive, not overly shy, friendly enough at least. 
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * Would prefer not. Can deal with it but the goal would definitely be to avoid that through breed and training.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * ANSWER
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * I'm not entirely sure on this one. Ideally I would bring the dog everywhere, currently my lifestyle would allow it, but I don't want to be entirely unable to leave them alone for a few hours on occasion when necessary. Definitely will crate-train.
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * Currently living with my parents, the dog would be my responsability but they would be somewhat of a safety net in case of sudden large fees, or if I needed a dogsitter.
     My mother does not want a large slobbery dog, my dad does not want a chihuahua. Those are their preferences as far as I know, lol.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * Two cats, fairly chill unless they're playing. They would be apprehensive at first but I think would make friends with a dog, as they did with Bourbon (previous dog.)
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * A 4 year old in the household (5 by the time I would get a dog), but it would be under direct supervision at all times and because of the cats he knows to be very gentle. 
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * No.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * None that would apply to the breeds I want. (NO Brachycephalic breeds, please, due to travel by air.)
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * -FAHRENHEIT- Average of 60-70, high of 85 (maybe). Average of 20-30, low of maybe 5-10 during the day like one or two days a year. Willing to purchase dog sweaters LOL. 
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    * I am (low-support needs) autistic, and have some anxiety issues. While not an official emotional support animal or anything, it will be my companion while I navigate the transition to adulthood, and will ideally be a comfort when people are too overwhelming. 
    It will be my adventure buddy, from flying to backpacking, etc.
    
    I have not owned a dog myself before, but I have been around them a lot, I'm doing my research, and I know the challenges. I think the project of training a dog would be good for me, and overall a dog is a good level of responsablility to get used to.
     Sorry if I'm not making sense. Not sure exactly when I'll move out, but not for a year or two at least, will most likely stay in the same town. 
    Not going away to college. I intend to do everything in my power to pay for and care for the dog myself but my family is willing to help out if necessary.
     
    I'm trying to be realistic, I know it can't go with me -everywhere- but it will not likely spend a ton of time on it's own.

Home equity loan; own house out right.,"Hello All,

I am looking to come up with about $60k for home renovations. I currently own my house without a mortgage and it was appraised for $600k.

I am dabbling with the idea of a home equity loan, but rates are still a bit uncomfortable for me (Navy Fed quoted me at 9%). I tried to make the argument that they are virtually assuming zero risk as my house does not have a mortgage, but they were unwilling to budge on the rates.

Does anyone have any recommendations on where to shop around or other options to leverage the equity in my house?",0,1731812714.0
Am I responsible for this debt? ,"My husband passed away in 2022. He had a credit card and I was an “authorized user”. After he passed I didn’t personally use the card, but there was recurring monthly charges that he had set up that continued to be charged to the account. I was recently made aware of this because they sent a letter in the mail (first time I’ve gotten anything from them, including this bill/notice) . The card is maxed out at a little over $15,000.00. There was no “estate” set up or anything like that. Our home I’m currently still living in. I’m planning to sell it soon though and now needing to know if I’m responsible for this debt? If I don’t pay it, will they take the amount to pay it off from the sale of the home? Is it a lien on the house?

Dog obsessed with chasing lizards but can never catch them. How do I satisfy her prey drive?,"Title. Basically she loves chasing lizards in the backyard all day but can never catch them cuz she's a bit dopey.

I'm a bit worried this is causing her too much frustration because she never gets the satisfaction of catching her prey. 

After I bring her back inside, I try and get her to stay on her bed then throw a high value treat that she can then go find in the house so that kinda substitutes as a ""catch"" for her but I really don't think it's working.

Any tips?

Enrichment for Paralyzed Dogs,"Hi! I have an 11 y/o pug who is (mostly) paralyzed in his back end; however he is still quite spunky and tries to play as much as he can. It is quite sad for me when he gets the ""zoomies"", but can't actually get up and run.

We play tug of war with him, take him to the park and help him walk with the aid of a sling (he hates the wheelchair).

"Mini Schnauzer, Border Terrier, or other? Looking to add a sidekick to my family!","Hi all, thanks in advance for your input and advice!

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* No, I’ve raised two dogs, and often watch my friends’ and family’s dogs. (Maltipoo to Doberman to Doodles)

I adopted a 2yo purebred Jack Russell 3 years ago however, and cared for her for 10 months but realized we were not a mutual fit due to her intense hatred of other dogs (my family nicknamed her Mike Tyson after she tried to bite my cousin’s dog in the ear). She had been raised by an elderly couple inside of an RV during covid, so she had no social skills and rarely was exercised unfortunately. She was super dog-aggressive and anxious. I took her to professional training twice a week and had to walk her 5-8 times a day to get her energy out, along with runs and playtime. The aggression was what made me realize it wouldn’t work out, as I live in a city and I think she needed to be on a farm. Rehomed her after this, and she is doing better! 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

\* Would love to rescue, but my needs are pretty specific, listed below

3) Describe your ideal dog.

\* Looking for an active small sidekick! I’d love a dog that is ok living in an apartment with me, but going on daily walks and the energy to go on long hikes, backpacking, and traveling on weekends. I want a smart dog that I can teach tricks, but not a lunatic like my Jack Russell. Needs to get along with other dogs well (will socialize the dog and train him/her young!). Also, my girlfriend has allergies to dogs, so looking for a dog that doesn’t shed too much. I also would like to be able to occasionally take the dog in the plane for short trips (not a dealbreaker, but nice to have). Another nice to have would be to have a dog that can learn decently reliable recall, I’d love to be able to take the dog off leash in safe areas so they can follow on a hike or do their thing

To sum up:

* Active, able to keep up on hikes and runs (when an adult) and go reasonable distances. 
* Low allergy risk for my gf
* Small enough to take anywhere
* Friendly with other dogs and people with socialization
* Not a crazy barker, although I am willing to train that if necessary
* Recall is possible through training

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* I’ve narrowed it down in my research to border terriers, it seems they are pretty stout little guys and switch between apartment living and long hikes. They are also pretty good with humans and other dogs. I’ve looked at mini schnauzers as well and mini poodles, but am worried about barking for schnauzers and energy for poodles. Little worried about recall with Border terrier, seems like they require quite a bit of training for good recall, which I would be able to do. Let me know if i’m totally off or missed anything!

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Tricks would be fun but most importantly a good recall, basic commands (sit, down, leave it, stay, etc), and good leash manners.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* I would be open to doing a sport if it helped the dog gain confidence. But it would be less about winning and more for training/confidence for the pup

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* Happy to do 1-1.5 hours of walking/running + active games/training a day. Otherwise I work from home so happy to do 4-6 short walks. Understandably more time for a puppy.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

\* 1-1.5 hours. Walking, fetch, hide and seek, hiding treats, etc. Yes there are a few dog parks near me, I’d love to take her to meet up with dog friends to play. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* I can do 5-10 mins a day or take them to a groomer when necessary. Happy to cut nails and bathe the dog too.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10) What size dog are you looking for?

\* Small, would be nice if they could fit in a small crate to go on the plane in the cabin from time to time, but not a dealbreaker.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* My gf is allergic to dogs (manageable with medication + less dander/shedding), so the less the better. I live in an apartment so a small amount of barking is ok, but ideally I can train them to bark less or when it’s reasonable.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Fairly important, it would be nice if I could train a consistent recall for going hiking or emergency situations

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Definitely a dog that likes to snuggle. Ok if they’re sometimes aloof but definitely prefer a sidekick that wants to snuggle and receive some love!

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* Eager to please 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

\* A bark is ok, but not uncontrollable barking. I’d prefer them not to jump (happy to train this), and learn to be patient and sit until the person comes to them. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* No, I’ve dealt with this before and I want a dog that can get along with other dogs. Ok if the dog is defensive where appropriate.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Just dog/people aggression and also don’t want a dog that is afraid of everything

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* I work remotely, but would like to be able to leave an adult dog alone occasionally for 4-5 hours when necessary.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

\* My gf will help care for and walk the dog, but I will be the main caretaker. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* No current pets

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* I rent but there are no restrictions on dogs. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* USA, N/A

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summers in 80-90ºF and winters of 40-50ºF

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I have 6k saved up. When should I buy my first car?,"Income right now is about 4k a month - I pay about 1900 in necessary expenses (rent, student loans, groceries).

How can I stop my dog from barking?,"I recently got a Maltese x shitsu puppy from my mum.

Tips for keeping dogs stimulated for (probable) long term hotel stay?,"My house was damaged by hurricane Helene so myself, the other adult in my family, and my two dogs had to leave and go to a hotel.

Would my dads life insurance be valid? ,"Hello, I’m sorry if this is all over the place. I have no clue what I’m doing. 

My (f22) dad (m55) passed away unexpectedly Saturday and my siblings ( C f34, M m25, R f23) and I have been trying to figure out his life insurance/401k info. 

My dad worked at a company (we will call it “D”) for 25 years until 2020 when he switched to “P”. 
When my dad passed he had life insurance through New York life. My sibs weren’t very close to dad, and mom and him got divorced a year or two ago. My brother and aunt called P and let the company know he passed away and asked about life insurance. They told both of them that dad was unemployed at time of death and that he didn’t have life insurance. Obviously we are all upset because now we have 12k in funeral expenses that we aren’t sure how we will pay in 30 days and we had NO clue he was unemployed. I talked with him regularly and he never mentioned anything about quitting so soon. 

My oldest sister C emailed them and they told her he DID have life insurance and I was named the sole beneficiary. The benefits director from P called me and let me know. I was in such shock that dad put me as the only beneficiary but I tried to write down as much as possible. She said he had 137k in it but also that the total was 370k??? 
She sent me the file I will have to sign and send back with his death certificate when we get it. She said that once that info gets sent in New York Life will determine if any exclusions apply since he was separated with the company at time of death. 



I’m just very confused because in the life insurance claim file it asks;

if he was considered an employee at time of death? It’s marked yes

Was the employee actively at work until time of death? It’s marked no (employment ended)

If the Employee was not actively at work immediately prior to his/her death or Dependent’s death, what was the reason? It’s marked discharged 

Was coverage still in effect during date of death? It’s marked no (the policy was going to be converted)

I miss my dog,"My ex boyfriend got a dog, a golden retriever. I was with her since the day he brought her home, when she was a 2 month puppy. Raised her, till she was a year old. Unfortunately, we broke up, and my baby was his to keep. Hand on my heart, till I had my sweetest fur baby, I didn’t know I was capable of loving this much. I’m not sure what being a mom feels like, but my maternal instincts surely kicked in while raising her. I love her, and miss her so much. ",1,1729277667.0
Home equity loan for primary home,We are fortunate  to have the valuation of our  primary home  ( currently financed at mortgage 2.55% APR 30 year fixed) appreciate over the years with over 1M+ untapped equity.  Its hard to let go of the amazing rate and I am sure other are in the same situation. I would love  to learn of ways to tap the equity without letting go of the mortgage rate and invest in  other home  for renting. One of the ways is to go for a home equity loan and use the amount towards the second home as long as there is a decent return. Are there any non-obvious pitfalls with the  home equity loan strategy or  am I missing any other avenues.?,0,1731774177.0
Does my portfolio look good? New to investing!,"Hi everyone,

I can put away £500 per month. I am 29 years old, and I am fine with a little bit of risk, although I also like having peace of mind, which explains why I decided to add 50% to a savings account. 

My idea of a portfolio is the following:

*  Saving account (5.2% interest rate): £250 (50%)
* VUAG (Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD Acc): £50 (10%)
* WWRL (Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF): £50 (10%)
* Bitcoin: £45 (9%)
* Apple: £35 (7%)
* Amazon: £35 (7%)
* Microsoft: £35 (7%)

  
I also have around £7000 put away in another saving account (4.5% interest rate). I cannot move this to the higher paying saving account (5.2%) because it has a monthly limit.

All investments are held into an ISA account, so I won't be paying any capital gain tax.

Any feedback please?

Thank you so much.",0,1732386610.0
Sell Paid off House or Rent it?,"I own a fully paid-off 3.7m dollar house in San Francisco and am dealing with a myriad of classic home ownership issues, the main one being a leaky roof. My plan was originally to move out of the house (in about 3 months) and rent it out. I have been told I can get around $15k a month in rental income. However, recently I’ve come to the realization that when things go wrong, home ownership is a real pain. 

Would I be better off, or equally well off, selling the house and investing the money? It’s difficult to predict the value of the house, but the rental income sounds like a great periodic cash boost. On the other hand, I imagine I can invest the money and pull out cash in similar quantities when I really need it. 

EDIT: I am actively working to fix the leaks and water damage/mold. Gotta do that whether or not I sell. Will probably cost a fortune. ",0,1732396934.0
Rollover IRA question ,"I left a job that had both a 403b (contribution + employer match) and a 401a (I think this was just employer contribution). I recently got a notice that they rolled over my 401a into a rollover IRA account. 

Total value of the rollover was $2,510.34. 

This is all being managed through fidelity. 

I want to invest this money, but I am planning on contributing to a “backdoor Roth IRA” and contributing the max of $7,000 later this year (I am high income earner).

I don’t understand the different types of IRAs and don’t want to get hit with a penalty.

1. Assuming this is a traditional IRA account, I believe there are no income limits so I shouldn’t get hit with a penalty? 

2. Does this lower the total amount that I can contribute to an IRA this year? (7000 - 2510 =4,490 left that I can contribute to Roth IRA?)

What dog should I have?,"Hi! I’m considering getting a dog, but I need permission. So I don’t mind what breed or what size. I just want a dog that is independent and won’t be running after or trying to intimidate my cat. My cat is a very shy cat, very afraid quickly especially of dogs.

[Breeds] Please help my find the right breed!,"
**Introduction**

1\)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be my first dog, i had friends, neighbors and family members with dogs so I have always been around them and volunteered my fair share of time loking after them

2\)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Being that my partner and I don't have a bunch of free time to stay home, we cant do a puppy right now so a rescue seems like our current path.

3\)	Describe your ideal dog.

* under 45lbs, has the on/off switch for playing, hiking, swimming and then chilling on the couch for those rainy/lazy days. Ideally eager to please and not stubborn. I don't want it sitting in my lap 24/7 but I also want my couch buddy so as long as the dog is not whining or begging for pets I'll be happy. I recognize training/socializing also helps this.

4\)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* If I could have a springer spainel with none of the crazy energy, that would be exactly what I am looking for. I hate to say that the esthetic of the dog is important to me but thats just the reality of things. I absolutely love the look of spaniel breeds like ESS, Brittany, Boykin, and love labs too but they are just too big. I can deal with high energy I just wont be able to give it 2-3 hours of sprinting everyday. I've learned that mental stimulation is almost just as effective if not more effective in getting rid of that energy so that is definitely something i will work into our routine. Not a huge fan of curly or super long coats. Definitely do not want hair growing over the eyes or any beard action. 

5\)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The biggest thing I can think of is walking off leash and instilling a great recall. I don't have any plans of hunting regularly but i do go once in a while so i will want the ability to let my dog go and be confident i can get it to come back without taking off.

6\) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No, but as i mentioned above, it might happen every now and then.

**Care Commitments**

7\) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* At least an hour a day of playing that involves training. I want to train while the dog is still engaged and does not loose interest. So maybe 45 min training a day and 1.5 hours of full play and then 2 hours of chilling around the house until bed. Im thinking Mon-Fri for this.

8\) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* One hour, minimum. More on the weekends or days i get home early from work 

9\)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I don't really want to have to go to the groomers so probably not a ton of maintenance requirements but if it needed any I would do them once a week/ or every two weeks. Depends on how much hair starts accumulating

**Personal Preferences**

10\)	What size dog are you looking for?

* 30-45 lbs. Nothing less and nothing more

11\) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding: Can handle medium shedding, I'd rather not take my dog to work with me on my clothes everyday.

* Barking: Excessive barking is a concern. Alert barking is fine, but barking which doesn't stop could be a problem.

* Slobber: Average slobber is fine.

12\) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Extremely important. We are looking for a dog we can trust off-leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13\) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Definitely snuggly but to a certain point. I want a couch buddy but i dont want to have my buddy sitting in my lap with its face or butt in my face. So a little control would be nice. Definitely do not want my dog begging for pets constantly.

14\) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More on the side of Eager-to-please but independence is going to be key for those 8 hour days alone while we are at work.

15\) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* One bark and I mean one bark, is fine, anything after that I will not allow. It's food that people know we have a dog but in no way am i looking for security.

16\) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No.

17\) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Overly-reactive behavior, destructive separation anxiety, excessive (beyond normal) barking. Food related aggression.

**Lifestyle**

18\) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 5 times a week the dog may be left alone for 4-5 hours. Partner works from home currently** so that could change but we will never leave it longer than 8 hours, any longer and its coming with us. Also ideally I'm getting a new job soon and it will either be hybird working from home and in the field work or ideally I can just bring it with me to work everyday. I'm an environmental scientist so thats sometimes an option for us

19\) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Both partner and I are dog lovers, and are both committed to doing the required work (feeding, cleaning, exercising, training, etc).

20\) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Currently have a cat that used to live with a dog. We would plan on getting another dog and another cat in the next 5 years or so.

21\) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No practically never unless one of our friends has a human baby for some reason

22\) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Rent yes but no breed or size restrictions 

23\) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Ontario, Canada. Pitbull breeds

24\) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Hot summers , cold winters ( Toronto/New York weather). The dog would need to be able to go on walks in the snow in the cold.

Feel free to ask more questions if you have any and thank you for the help!",1,1729277195.0
Possible adding a second dog,"1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?    Currently have a 16 months lab that's on the low energy side. 
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  Will get from breeder.  Shelter dogs are not an issue where I'm from and I don't want to import a dog.

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? Field Labrador, Assue or working German Shepherd.

Necessary Dental Procedures That I Cannot Afford- Need Advice,"Hi reddit!

I found out recently that I need to have a string of dental procedures/surgeries done that will cost me more than I can afford even with insurance. I looked into the clinics/universities and they cannot accommodate the urgency and actually cost around the amount of what it costs to have it done elsewhere with insurance.

I discussed a payment plan with my dentist but it still would not be very helpful/would make it impossible to pay my bills for that month. What have you all done for this? 

I'm thinking of opening up a new credit card for this but am wary about it as I have just started getting my credit back on track and it's still not stellar (656).

Any help/advice would be so appreciated. Thank you in advance!

TLDR (backstory);

I finally got dental insurance after almost a decade and was able to go to the dentist. Unsurprisingly, I need to have a procedure done which could have been avoided with preventative care. The procedure is for an infected area that will only spread if waited on and requires a bridge as there will be front teeth extractions (opting for this over implants because that would be financially impossible).

I just love my little girl ,"My little girl Laika is a 9 months old rescue mystery mix (Maibe Griffon, Ariegoise and Beagle), yes, she is going through adolescence, it is difficult, but I would not change it for anything in the world.

Lately I have had very bad news regarding my health, including a brain tumor.

I live alone with Laika, she goes to work with me, neither of us can be without the other. She has been my support these weeks, no matter how bad or sad I may feel, she shows me her belly or forces me to clean up her messes. 

I know it's not right, but I've also noticed that lately she's been very protective when I'm not feeling well, almost even biting other people who come near me if I fall sleep somewhere (consecuence of the tumor). I know it's not right, and I gently correct her, but it makes me feel so good that she cares so much, and when she lays on top of me or asks me to hold her, I know I'm not alone.

Said Goodbye Today,"Cheyenne was a 60lbs German shepherd-Lab mix. 10 year old, tripod (back right leg missing amputated at 4 months old). Wednesday morning she woke up and couldn't use her back leg. She could only walk on her front legs and was dragging her back around. I made an appointment at the vet for Thursday. She was able to walk intermittently and the vet prescribed methocarbamol (500mg every 12 hrs) and carprofen (50mg every 12 hrs). So Thursday and Friday she has the meds, and she was walking fine. Saturday she didn't appear to be in any pain, was walking fine, chasing the cat, etc so no pain meds. This morning no issues and I thought we should take the dogs for a walk since she seems to be doing ok, they hadn't been for a few days, and we were going to be out skydiving all day and they'd be stuck in the house. We made it 0.1 mile before she started giving up so we turned around. I went around the block with the other dog and my husband went home with Cheyenne. He had to carry her home. I got home like 7 minutes later and gave her her pain pills. We decided to stay home. About 45 minutes later she was breathing heavy, her eyes were twitching, and her pupils were huge. Thought maybe it was a bad reaction and she was over heating so we put some ice packs in her armpits under her neck and on her stomach to bring her temp down and then called the emergency vet to see if they thought we should bring her in. We brought her in and within minutes of us arriving they were doing CPR on her.

I'm afraid making her go on the walk or giving her the medication caused her seizure. I'm worried she died thinking she was alone. I'm worried she was scared and in pain. I should've asked for imaging on Thursday.

The only issue is that he is now 16 weeks old, and has spend most of his life so far in glass pen on his own (although probably handled by perspective buyers from time to time). I understand that this these first few months 8wks - 16wks are pretty crucial for the puppies development, so I am wondering if is perhaps too late.. with the right socialisation/training/affection, could it still be ok?

I was bought up with dogs (border collies) but this will be my first dog as an adult. I'm a looking for a snuggle companion and a hiking buddy, but I worried he might be too old to for crate training, human bonding, obedience etc.

Could anyone give me some advice? Many thanks!",1,1728270705.0
"Adopting a ""confident"" senior dog when already owning a ""fearful"" adult dog?","My partner and I adopted a dog estimated to be a year old in 2019. A different vet later estimate he was more likely to be 8 months old. He's a good boy but afraid of the world. Whens he's in a spot where there are more dogs than humans (day care) he becomes much more comfortable. He gets along well with other dogs, he'll give a warning growl when he needs to and has never had an incident with another dog. He has shown protectiveness of our bed and recently the couch so he has lost access to both.

My partner and I have been thinking about adopting a senior but are worried our dog won't like to ""share"" his home. I brought this up with the vet who said that submissive dogs like him sometimes have an easier time in the world when they have a more confident dog to look up to. If we did want to adopt, is there a way to test if the dogs will get along? Can we search for a dog known to be ""confident"" in a previous home?",1,1731800377.0

My dog had a scary dream 😭 and I asked if she was a skin walker (real skin walker story here so scary),"So this is somewhat funny but also I felt REALLY bad for her in the moment. So I was asleep and I heard my dog whining and so I thought she was locked in the room and couldn't get out but had to potty so I opened the door a bit more and got back into bed and closed my eyes but she kept whining and so I ignored her. After a minute of her whining and me calling her name(to get her to shut up or get on my bed) I figured she wanted on my bed but had failed to get up cause she's a small dog so I was finally like fuck it fine help you get up so I went to the edge of my bed and called for her but she didn't come so I raised my voice a bit and put on a firm tone and then she came to me but it wasn't from the edge of my bed it was from the top underneath of my bed and when she was in my hands I felt that she was shaking like a lot so I was like tf r u okay and I turned the lights on and the only way I could describe it was that she looked pale. Her ears were all the way back and she had these scared puppy dog eyes and so I picked her up and we hung out for a few minutes and I cuddled her. After a few seconds she was honestly fine but I just felt like she needed a bit of attention and comforting. I had this thought deep in my mind(i know it's silly) that maybe a skin walker ate her underneath my bed and that it wasn't my doggo anymore so I started having her do tricks that she didn't know. I had her do paw (which I taughter her but she wouldn't ever do it unless I was really mean and made her) and she did it so quickly I thought it was odd. So then I started trying to have her do one I KNEW she didn't know which was roll over and ofc she didn't do it cause she dosent know the damn trick. So I was like whatever and let it go kinda just making SURE she wasnt eaten by a skin walker and abt 20 minutes after I looker at he and said ""it's okay Bella I know you had a really bad dream you're okay now. Or you got eaten by a skinwalker"" and then she perked up her ears at the word skin walker and so I said it again and was like wth 💀 and after a minute of just repeating it I said it slowly, ""skin"" then ""walker"" and she perked up her ears at walker, she thought that for WHATEVER reason I was telling her we were gonna go on a walk lmao so yeah that's my odd ass dog story for today hope you enjoyed my Ted talk",1,1730269440.0

How to stop my puppy from rough housing with my cat?,"I have a 5 month German Shepherd husky mix, and we can't stop her from playing rough with the cat. She is obsessed and repeatedly going for the cat.


It is not aggressive I don't think. I know she is just playing, but it's rough, and the cat is older and quiet frankly.... Fat. He doesn't run or jum away and the puppy just keeps at him. I worry not only for the cat but also the actuality of a claw in the eye.


We tried teaching the leave it command, and then using it towards the cat , but this smart shit quickly figured out that squishing the cat gets you a treat, so we learned a lesson and moved on. Currently I'm using pure positive ee enforcement, but the good moments are so few ( when the cat is in eye sight) and doesn't react that I don't know that I'm making any progress. I can leash her and give her 100 treats for avoiding the cat and 5 min later she's chewing on his ear.


It's becoming frustrating, she's so smart, and very obedient for her age but I can't seem to break this. And I don't want it to continue or progress to something worse.",1,1730593809.0
Providing for parents ,"Friend of mine, has a business with their dad and share the income to cover their rent (900 bucks for a house of 4), cars, insurance food, and school fees for his brother. The business involves manual labour, and requires the 2 of them, so one can’t quit. But my friend (25M) can’t start their own life, cause they feel responsible for everyone. Since the family uses up all the money, they never save enough to pay taxes. Every year they owe taxes and pay it off slowly each month, but then the next tax bill comes around and they owe more. My friend (25M) is the one that legally owns the business, so all the bills are in their name. Can’t afford to survive so they also have credit card loans. The debt that my friend created on his own, includes some university loans and credit card loans. But since his name is on the business, he owes a lot more. There’s one other adult in the family, his mom, who refuses to work. The business doesn’t seem sustainable, financially or for my friends well-being. What can he do?

* Investment account for the vast majority of our money - brokerage, retirement, and money market accounts --> managed quarterly / monthly at most

Can creditors pin this on me?,"
My dad has cancer and he's going to die, it might be a few months, maybe a year.
He is a U.S. resident but hasn't worked in like a year due to the cancer, he recently moved back overseas but continues to use his U.S. credit cards to cover expenses there and back in the U.S.
He might lose the residency by January/February for being out of the country more than 6 months by then.
He will probably live his remaining days overseas, back home. 

He's making his minimum payments but eventually these cards will be maxed out and probably not paid.

He has no assets in the U.S., and his address was my house.
We do have a joint checking because that's how I've been able to send him money for other expenses and CC payments,  but no joint credit accounts.

Can the creditors pin his credit card balances on me later on??

"Inherited money, low experience, how to compete with inflation?","Hi

I recently inherited money equal to 9-10 x my yearly salary. Now I'm looking for good options to increase the value, and avoid having it being diluted by inflation.

My financial situation is as follows  
\- 3 k USD paid out each month  
\- 1,5 k in expenses  
\- Own a house with my SO, who makes about the same as me. We share a loan on a house worth 500 k.

My current plan is putting 5% in stock.

With regards to the rest I have received advice from my bank - my current plan is to put 200 k's into ETF's, and 2x 100 k into stock funds.

I'm willing to take medium risk, and want a pretty aggressive investment profile.

Am I making a mistake? I would have big problems seeing this money decrease or go away, it originates from my fathers hard work through a lifetime.

What's the smartest move? I have also considered buying real estate and renting it out, but the return compared to ETF/equity fund, would be about half, according to current calculations.

I've generally done well following his advice but most of the sheltered cash I've been holding has been there since 2022. At this point I'm scared to invest a lump sum, the market generally seems to keep going up and up but everyone (including dad) talks about a looming recession, or worse. I know no one can really predict what's going to happen but I've love some thoughts on what others would do in my situation.",0,1732230386.0
What are the tried and true ways to manage a dying parent’s bills?,"My dad’s on likely the last few months, and in preparation my sibling and I now have power of attorney over all of our mom and dad’s financial and medical decisions. We’re fortunate that our dad has had the wherewithal to set him and my mom up just fine financially in these final days, so when it comes to affording medical bills, hospice, or whatever else transpires, we’re in okay shape.

Of note, neither my sibling nor I live close to our parents.

The issue is around how to manage these bills. My dad pays for *all* the bills that come through, and we’ve not had to manage any of it. He’s not really in a good state to handle these in the upcoming months, im afraid, so I think we’re trying to understand how to handle all this on his behalf.

I’d like some advice on how we get started to ensure they’re not caught up in any collection issues. How do we get a sense of their monthly bills, how do we know when they’re sent bills, should we have the billing addresses changed to mine, etc etc?

Thanks for any help!

Tips against home alone boredom?,"For context, my girl is a 7 years old Australian Shepherd, that I adopted last summer. Over the last year and a half I spent most of my time at home, working only two days a week (a small side gig while I was recovering from burn-out). Now I have recently applied for a full time job, and I have some worries concerning my dog, if she's gonna be lonely and/or bored spending considerably more time home alone. 

I've had dogs my entire life and knew when I adopted her that I would return to a more active live eventually, therefore made sure to not get a dog too hyper and demanding (might sound contradictory with her breed, but  this one is a real couch potato). She's very chill and spends most of her time lounging around. We have a large yard and she exercises everyday but can skip a proper walk one day without going nuts. She's the only dog but has a cat friend who she adores.

"Help Narrow Down Or offer alternatives: Golden Retriever/Doodle, Aussie, Shih Poo ","Hello, we recently moved into our new home and are looking to narrow down our dog search. We both absolutely love dogs, and would like to get one next year. We are having a hard time narrowing down or figuring out what might fit our lifestyle. We are both in our early 30’s with experience with dogs in the past. We both absolutely adore golden retrievers but are unsure if they would be too big for us. We often like to camp in a roof top tent and are trying to figure out sleeping arrangements with a dog. There is not enough room for a large dog, but room for a small/medium size. We easily could make a full dog bed inside the back of our SUV and either let him sleep by himself there or one of us could sleep with him. (We car camped for a year or two and this would be no problem) Or a small/medium dog could fit up with us in the tent. We go camping maybe half a dozen times a year. 


 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Long term couple (10+ years) have owned dog separately in the past, this would be our first dog together. Wife previously owned a Shih-Poo. I often watch/take care of family member’s two labradors. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference, but leaning towards a breeder. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Loving, people friendly, loves to cuddle. Can be left alone for a few hours. Soft/longer haired preferred over short hair. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Golden retriever- love how happy and friendly they are. Gentle. 
* Golden doodle- same as above except slightly smaller. Less shedding? 
* Aussie- ideal size, would be great for hikes/outdoors
* Shih Poo/Malti Poo - easier to handle/pickup, smaller size for sleeping on our bed or in a tent. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just the very basics, (sit, stay, etc)  crate training. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30 win walk daily, plus a lot of inside playing. I love to rile them up and play.  We have a dog park across the street. Large open field across the street as well for playing fetch is an option. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Brushing 2/3 times a week, but can accommodate slightly more or less. Yes open to trimming nails, cleaning ears. Can also hire a professional or take to groomers throughout the year. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* This is where we are stumped. We like the ability to pick up the smaller size dogs, but also like the idea of a larger dog being able to sort of take care of himself, ie. getting up and down the car/couch/bed. Also not worrying as much about hawks or coyotes targeting a smaller pup. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Light to medium shedding is okay. Least amount of barking as possible. Medium slobber is okay. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Yes this is something we would like to be able to do. While not everyday, we would like to not have to worry about the dog bolting off away also. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Yes, the snuggly the better.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Any tips on stopping dogs from eating cat poop in our backyard? ,"Okay so this is sort of a rant and a plea for help lol. We have a fairly large backyard and a huge feral cat colony that lives in the neighborhood. We have called the available resources in our county, but we are low on the list and in the meantime we are finding it impossible to keep the cats from using our yard as a litter box. 

Our yard is fenced so they’re literally coming over it or digging under it, and we can’t even find the cat poop fast enough to keep our dogs away. They have a strong leave it command but it does literally nothing when it comes to cat poop. It’s like crack for them. They’re also sneaky and will find it but circle back around when I’m across the yard and can’t get to them fast enough. I feel insane right now bc it’s sooo gross and the only solution we have right now is to not let them run in the backyard but that’s not exactly fair to the pups (we literally got this house so they’d have a yard). 

Any advice? Should I just start a routine dewormer to be safe? They are updated on all vaccines and take simparica trio every month and I know that does some intestinal parasite prevention. ",1,1726502392.0
Refusing to Move When Not Getting His Way on Walks,"I am having issues with my recent rescue refusing to move when he doesn’t get his way on walks. 

Background: I adopted him three months ago from the county shelter. Most likely a Black Mouth Cur mix, maybe lab. He is 70lbs. Strong tracking and direction memory. He has developed points of interests: houses with cats, dogs he likes, a dog park he tracked to on his own, etc. He does not sleep with me and is served his meals after I have eaten. He does not eat from plates or share food. 

He has no other behavior issues. Most of them time on walks he is excellent: loose lead, no pulling, no reactivity, sits down when he is commanded, sits when he sees other dogs. He is a highly intelligent dog and I am impressed by his ability to create routes from memory. I provide high value treats he only receives on walks.

He sets out each morning with a destination in mind. The distance is not the issue. We have many routes roughly the same amount of steps. I am happy he is comfortable in his new setting and has expanded his boundaries. 

The issue comes in when he wants to cross the street, go a certain direction, go further on a walk. If I do not have a high value treat he likes, he refuses to move. He will sit down and eventually lay down. If I move in the direction he wants, he immediately gets up and walks. This is most prevalent on our morning walks. We are typically out the door no later than 6:15am after waking around 5:45am. 

Today’s walk took an extra 35 minutes due to this. Two blocks took 20 minutes as he wanted to cross the street, we had already walked for an hour. I physically pushed him eventually as rush hour traffic had started. He will stop in the middle of an intersection when I will not go his direction. Even when I make him sit before we cross he will pull towards his way and then sit down. 

We live in the center of a major city. He is not reactive to sounds or cars. I have had to physically pull him up and off a busy street. I use a collar and short lead. I volunteer with horses and use a very similar pattern as I would to move a horse. Horses are easier at this point. 

I am at my wits end as I am not willing to be led by him and tired of setting out on walks unsure of his mood. In terms of exercise, we get plenty of steps in and he has games and puzzles at home. 

Any help is appreciated! ",1,1730380867.0
Failed Re-homing Due to Dog Meeting: Was there a problem? ,"My family and I recently decided to adopt another dog. We have one already and were told the two would need to meet as part of the adoption process.

Here is a quick description of her if anyone thinks it relevant, otherwise skip ahead.

>!She is a small mongrel from Cyprus that was picked up at around 8 months living in a field and brought to the UK as a rescue. We adopted her while we had another rescue, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, who died 2 years ago. They enjoyed each other's company and got on well, mainly sleeping together, occasionally playing, but for the most part minding their own business. As a younger dog she played a lot with other dogs on walks, but as she's grown up she has become rather aloof and does not play with many other dogs. She is happy to greet them before going back to sniffing and chasing squirrels. She is usually very submissive with other dogs, rolling over if a big dog charges at her. She has bared her teeth one or two times when she can't escape, but never anything more, always with her tail tucked and never having approached the other dog.!<

Here is a quick description of the dog we visited if anyone thinks it's relevant, otherwise skip ahead to the 'incident'.

>!The dog we went to visit was a female Staffordshire Bull Terrier, 1.5 years old. No history or records on her. Needs were: no children under 12. Walked every day. Can live with other dogs but doesn't have to. Described as anxious around new people and easily scared. However came into the pen like a heat-seeking missile and launched herself onto our laps, licking our faces and enjoying being stroked and scratched. Easy to calm down with some soft words and would sit quietly and contentedly having her neck scratched. Clearly has a lot of energy after being in her kennel all day, but isn't manic/hugely over-stimulated. She was also un-spayed and in heat, which may or may not be relevant.!<

The two dogs were introduced on-lead in a field. Both dogs wagged their tails and sniffed one another before mainly investigating the grass as we walked on. Little further interaction other than sniffing where the other urinated.

Now the 'behavioural specialist' arrives for our dog to be off-lead and an assessment. Once again, dogs wag tails and sniff one another upon meeting, and spend the next 10 minutes sniffing the grass and running around, sometimes side by side, but with little other interaction. **At this point the Staff wants to play, and runs up behind our dog (in a playful manner - tail-wagging, bouncy step, but in the way Staffs want to play, i.e. about to shoulder barge and leading with her mouth). Our lets out a growl and opens her mouth, standing tall. The staff takes a step back with her own mouth open, and for a second the two look at each other, before mutually turning away, and resuming sniffing the grass, hackles go down, and run around independently etc.** Neither dog snapped their mouth closed or made contact with the other. It was single growl that stopped as soon as the Staff backed off. In the next 10 minutes they do get close to one another, sniffing the same piece of grass at times, but do not really interact any further.

The behaviour specialist claimed it was not the correct way for her to have communicated, and that ""she is no longer in the wild and does not need to show the full spectrum of dog behaviour"". Suggested that we waited too long before getting another dog (an insensitive comment I thought - the previous dog was dearly loved and we all felt very sad after having him put down, 2 years ago to the day). The meeting was therefore considered unsuccessful, and the re-homing application was denied.

*Are other dog owners in agreement that such an incident is poor behaviour from a dog? And also an indicator that 2 dogs are unlikely to get along?* If so, I have been totally misinterpreting canine behaviour for years - I was pleased by the interaction and I thought it showed successful communication between 2 dogs when one wanted to play and the other didn't. I see it happen every day and have never thought anything of it, and used to welcome other dogs telling mine off in the same manner when she was young and over-confident with them.",1,1727690008.0

Need guidance on future investments (Car + Bills),"Hi, I just turned 18 a few months ago and I finally was able to get a job, I’ve been training and should hopefully start working full time by next week. I don’t have many people to talk to about finances, and I would like to handle things as best as possible. I currently don’t have a car, but I am going to be putting all my savings from work towards a car, and I’ve found one for $5,600 ($6,300 after fees, taxes, etc), and I also want to start investing in savings accounts (ROTH’s, multifaceted investment accounts, daily investing, possible trading). I know I’m not providing a lot, but I just don’t even know what to share to get advice. I would like to get a car as soon as possible, I have nearly no money saved, and it would open up my life a lot more, so that’s why I’m prioritizing it, as well as the fact that I only have a few months before it gets cold and rainy, and I won’t be able to commute to work easily without a car (bike/public transportation commute around 1.2 hours, with a car it’s 20 minutes). I don’t know anything about loans, and I’m pretty scared to have absolutely any debt for fear of not having enough to pay it back before the interest causes me to pay even more, like I’ll never be able to pay it off. But would it be a smart financial decision to try and opt for a loan? Either now, or maybe after I save $3,000 or $5,000? I want to be able to afford the car and pay it off quickly, and my main issues are these two. 1) If I get a loan sooner, and get the car, the loan will be a lot bigger, needing $6,000 or so, it would make work commute much easier, and allow for more flexibility, but I would need to pay monthly for insurance, the loan, gas, and other car expenses, which may make it difficult to feel comfortable with my savings/income. 
Or, option 2) I can try and work as much as possible before the weather gets worse, which the work isn’t hard, but I chance a lot of risk having to ride a bike upwards of 20-30 miles daily, which is mentally and physically exhausting, and I would be doing it nearly everyday, but it lets me save money for a car. I could make maybe around half the car price, $3,200 estimate, in maybe a month to two months? Would that be a better idea to get a small loan with less interest and less to pay back?

I made a payment to a company based in England for digital marketing services. However, I never received anything in return. After some investigation, I found out the company was actually a Ponzi scheme. The company took money from people, promising to build their digital marketing business, but hired a Canadian third-party company to run ads for them—using the ads to promote their fraudulent scheme under the guise of providing digital marketing services.

I paid through a Stripe link provided by the Canadian company, which seemed legitimate at the time. I filed a dispute through American Express, but it was rejected.

do you all have general or specific advices please?

do we need to keep the dog in the crate everytime there is no one in the house and everytime he has to sleep? or it's necessary only when it's a untrained puppy and then he can roam freely in the house without doing any damage and he could even sleep in just a dogs bed without being locked or even sleeping with us sometimes?

does the crane need to be settled in specific place and then never be moved from there? 

when the dog becames trained I can walk him in public places without problems right? just bring him around, in the car, on vacation, on the beach etc (except where it's not permitted).

"[Breeds] Recommendations would be helpful, thank you!","\*\*Introduction\*\*

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* Not my first dog, currently own a English Cocker Spaniel/Cavalier King Charles Spaniel cross. She's a very good girl.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

\* I would prefer to go through a reputable breeder as I prefer the extra certainty you get in the genetic characteristics of the dog, as well as the knowledge of exactly where the dog came from.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

\* Active breeds with biddable natures. I would like to practise agility and obedience with the dog, eventually retiring it into a less active, but still mentally challenging activity, ideally scentwork. I would prefer a larger dog, with my preferred limit being around 26 inches at the withers, but will consider breeds up to 30 inches.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* White Swiss Shepherd, Samoyed, Collie (Rough or Smooth).

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Agility, Obedience, Games such as fetch, eventually scentwork.

\* I probably won't compete with the dog, but I would like to train agility and obedience anyway as activities for physical and mental stimulation.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* It's difficult to quantify exactly how much time, but the dog would be my main use of time, other than work. I plan on walking and playing fetch in the mornings to provide physical exercise, then another, longer, more engaging, walk later in the day. On days with extra time, I will be taking the dog for hikes, or setting up the agility set in a park.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* When taking into account morning and afternoon walks, as well as vigorous play, I hope to provide an average of 2 hours daily. There are two park areas I will be regularly walking the dog. People do bring their dogs to these parks, but I have walked my previous dog in both, and never experienced issues with mishandled dogs.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* I am open to regular brushing if required. I am less confident with trimming hair. I can definitely clean ears and give occasional baths. We currently have a trusted groomer that services our other dog.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)What size dog are you looking for?

\* Larger breeds, with a preferred maximum of 26"" at the withers. I will consider breeds up to 30"", but I would not like to go below 20"".

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* I am fine with shedding. Our current dog sheds a ton. I understand that most dogs bark, I am willing to engage in training to reduce this. I don't like slobber and would prefer minimal drool.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* I would prefer a breed with low wanderlust and good recall. I am willing to invest a lot of time in training recall in order to be able to let the dog off-leash.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behaviour\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* I would prefer an affectionate dog.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* A biddable breed would be preferable, although dogs are not machines, so a breed with a stubborn streak that can be minimised with good training is not out of the question.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* Preferably indifference, but I understand this is a function of training, rather than breed. I will be training against any guarding tendencies. I would prefer the dog greet strangers with either polite indifference, or friendliness. I will be training the dog in this direction regardless, so more boisterous, friendly breeds are also welcome for consideration.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* I would prefer not to deal with dog aggression.

17) Are there any other behaviours you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* I do not want a breed that tends to be aloof with it's owners.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* There will be someone at home most of the time. Schedules will occasionally line up in such a way that the dog may have to stay home for a few hours alone. I intend to train the dog to deal with separation anxiety, if possible.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* Other people in the house have few preferences. They tend to accept or reject option on a breed by breed basis, so I will just have to suggest whatever breed is recommended to them and see what they say. They will be minorly involved in training the dog. Mostly reinforcing training in how they interact with the dog. I will be caring for most of the dogs needs.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* I currently have a English Cocker Spaniel/Cavalier King Charles Spaniel mix. However, I do not plan on acquiring the dog until the aforementioned passes.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No, but I would like the dog to be good with children.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* No.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* I live in the UK, there are several banned breeds here, but I am not interested in any breeds bred for guarding.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summer temperatures rarely break 30c and winters rarely go below -5c. Averages are probably between 5c-15c

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* As mentioned before, this dog and the current one I have will not be living together.

I don't even know where to start. ,"Some background : we have 3 dogs; Axl (almost 10yr old Pitty mix) Luna (5ish yr old husky mix) and Finn (almost 7 month husky / aussie shep mix) 

All rescues( Luna and Axl from a local shelter/ Finn was rehomed bc prev owner couldn't handle a puppy in a tiny apartment while also having a toddler at home) 

This post is for Finn specifically.  For the most part, everyone gets along. However, at random times for what seems like no reason Finn will simply lose her sh*t and go after Luna (who is more than double her size) tonight, it was while everyone was in bed going to sleep. Luna doesn't retaliate but does try to defend herself - obviously I break things up and everyone gets separated /goes to their own space to calm down. I've been nipped a couple of times.

We've only had Finn since end of July so she's still in the 3-3-3 stages. She's a good dog, and super smart and trainable. But I don't understand what is going on with her. 

She's still very hesitant around people (including us) and stiffens up when approached, but if she comes on her own she's very lose and wiggly, not crazy affectionate which is totally fine, I can absolutely live with that (Luna is super similar in that she'll ask for affection when she wants it/otherwise leave her be). But with Finn, and these random outbursts /attacks (should note she doesn't do that with Axl just Luna) I'm having serious flashbacks to a previous dog we had that after 3yrs, thousands of dollars, multiple trainers and specialists and vet visits and meds was so violent we had no choice other than B/E. I don't want to even think if going that route again, but maybe Finn might have to be in an only dog home? I may have to find her a new home. I'm trying not to cry as I even type that sentence. 

Any advice, please. ",1,1728275540.0

Roth IRA - Withdrawal of Contributions,"I'm planning on pulling a large chunk of IRA contributions.  I'm not yet 59.5 and have had the account for well over 5 years. I know that 'Contributions can be withdrawn at any time without tax implications or penalties', but I'm hoping I can get some detail on how exactly that works when it comes time for taxes. I've transferred between a few different brokerages and have a basis carryover that I can't directly determine.  I have personal notes and intend to withdraw less than I contributed regardless.  

My question is will Vanguard send me a tax form of some sort indicating how much I've contributed and attesting that the amount I pulled is below that limit?  If not, do I need to report anything to the IRS and if so, do I need to provide anything that attests the amount I've contributed over the years or is that all tracked anyway?

"""Payday Loan"" but for guaranteed annual bonus?","I am finding myself in a bit of a financial bind, and am due to receive a substantial annual bonus as part of my compensation that is usually paid out in March for the previous year. Are there any lenders or types of loans that can in essence ""advance"" some of that bonus, if I can provide proof of good standing and strong employee performance?

Should I stay in my very cheap (but problematic) apartment while paying off student loans?,"My gross annual salary is $130,000, before any bonus. Works out to about $7,500/month take home. I live in a very cheap apartment, about $600/month, which is about 8% of my take home pay. I live here because the low rent allows me to put more money each month toward paying off my law school loans.


But the apartment has issues. There are critters living in the wall and ceiling. The landlord has put down some poison pellets for rats, but whatever is hanging out in my wall/ceiling is still there, and it sounds bigger than a rat or mouse. Storm damage this year has caused trees to fall and take out power lines, and has caused a lot of damage to the roof and side of the building. As a result, the ceiling leaks whenever it rains. Until now I've always just put down a bucket and dealt with it. But it's gotten progressively worse, and this morning, part of the ceiling fell in and landed on me while I was still in bed. It was about a half-inch thick portion of plaster (like the popcorn ceiling you see in older buildings), probably about an 8 foot by 8 foot section, so it's not like the roof literally caved in on my head or anything, but still. I don't like my ceiling falling on my while I'm sleeping.


I tend to be very frugal and conservative with money, especially now, when I have student loans to pay down. I could move to a much newer, bigger, nicer apartment, and still not spend more than 25% of my monthly income on rent. But I tend to be a bit stingy, and I like the safety net that comes with living so far below my means. I'm wondering if I've crossed the line from very frugal to downright unhealthy. 


What do you all think? Would you continue living in the very cheap apartment and paying off the student loans as aggressively as possible, or would you move to a nicer place?


EDIT: I have about $79,000 remaining on the student loans. I've been paying about $4,000-$5,000 per month toward them.",0,1731604312.0
How do you figure out what a dog likes to do for fun?,"My dog (some kind of hound, probably 1 year old) keeps play-bowing at me, but I haven't found any kind of game he likes to play. He doesn't do fetch, he doesn't chase toys, he doesn't seem to comprehend tug of war. If I leave him alone he'll pick up his soft toys (or my socks) and carry them around a bit, but again, he doesn't chase those if I throw them, although he'll surrender them willingly enough if I ask for the socks back. 

I'm in an apartment and have limited space to let him run around. There's a fenced area I can take him to so he can run around off leash, but he mostly doesn't actually bother to run? He'll run with me on a leash sometimes, but he doesn't reliably chase when we're in the fenced area.

I'm just worried that he's bored. The other problem is that he likes me a lot more than he likes toys. He would always prefer that I just pet him rather than play with a toy. We're doing basic training, and he's pretty good at it, although cue discrimination is a little rough right now. I know he's a pretty smart dog, I just want to make sure he gets some activity!

So basically, my question is just how do you figure out what a dog likes to do? And/or how do you teach games?

Update: Wow, thanks y'all! I'm going to look at scent games for him, that does sound promising. I've tried taking him to the little dog park here several times, but there's not been another dog when I've done that so I don't yet know how he does with other dogs yet. Once I get that figured out and am confident about his recall and responsiveness when around strange dogs, I'll look at options for agility or barn hunt or something. This is all great stuff!

Why the hate on the doodle population here on reddit? Discouraging information here on /dogs but could use help in finding more information on where to start. ,"Hi all, newbie here to /dogs but an avid user here on reddit.  I have been an animal lover all my life having owned cats, dogs, fish, and even rats at one point.  My family lost our two rescue lab mixes in 2019 and 2023 respectfully.  My children being 11 and 5 were asking me for a cat but mom said no so now they are practically begging for a dog.  After much consideration and healing plus knowing that my oldest is showing his responsibility to me in meaningful ways I decided to start searching for a dog.  Wife and I are leaning towards the doodle hybrid breeds mainly because they look like mini chewbaccas and don't shed nearly as much as what we owned before.  

I seen many posts on facebook and even looked around central florida and breeders are running amok.  Everything speaks and writes for profit.  Maybe some people whom are on youtube seem a little bit more knowledgeable on the breed and more geniune.  Still when I looked up more information here on reddit, specifically the how to choose a reputable breeder.  There seems to be a lot of animosity here regarding these 'designer dogs.'  Seems like peeps want me to find a champion direct descendant of either a working showcase dog or something that competes in pagents....   I think my family just wants a quality family pet that would be good fit for my children without breaking the bank.

I was really stressed out and on top of it all, my grandmother was passing.  I tried to start my own business, but I failed.  I was unable to find work so I continue to live off my savings.  I decided to take a year off and focus on myself.  Later, when I ran out of savings I still couldn’t find work.  I started using more and more of my credit cards for bills, groceries and even to pay for rent so I could keep some cash incase I needed it for an emergency and if credit cards would cut me off.  i guess i went into a depression of some sorts and lost track of time and still coudnt find a job, eventually spiraling out of control in credit card debt.

recently i was able to land a few interviews and i have a shot at landing a career for $60k usd salary.  I would say I could probably  pay off the credit card debt over the next 4-7 years? if it wasnt that I am in my mid 30s and I also owe $100k in student loans that are deferred until next year.  I want to start a family.  I want a fresh start.

Recommend a chill small breed (tired after having a reactive big one),"Introduction

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No I had a big mixed breed dog. I thought that he was perfect except the fact that he was reactive to dogs, lunging but no barking. It was excitement, not aggression. So, very big dog with reactivity = life is a living hell. Trainers didn't get any sense to him and I tried so freaking hard with no success... so we just avoided dogs. I miss having a dog though. My childhood dogs were both reactive (aggression, not excitement), they were small ones so I know the breed doesn't really matter. I was a kid, didn't know how to handle it. But after my own dog became reactive, I though that am I the problem? But then there are my friends who have such easy pups, tell me how they didn't do much and the dogs are just angels. I want that...

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* Breeder this time please

3. Describe your ideal dog.

* A good buddy that would handle going with me everywhere. Meeting friends, going to various different hiking spots or nature trails, shopping, chilling in the office. I just want a companion that is kind to everybody but not too interested. I need a dog that would be easier to handle, for me and my mom who helps sometimes.

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* A small dog would be nice. I don't want a big dog anymore, even though I love their personalities a bit more.  Not sure what breeds would be the calmest. I heard cavaliers are cool but I don't want a sick breed. Is there anything similar to that?

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just how to behave and maybe some tricks.

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Nope.

Care Commitments

7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 4-8 hours, depends a lot on the day

8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* Walking around 1,5+ hours on a weekday, 2+ hours or more on weekends. Less if that's too much for a small fellow. I would not be using a dog park. Playing in the garden too.

9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I think I'd do it myself. I could brush a couple times a week.

Personal Preferences

10. What size dog are you looking for?

* Small or smaller medium.

11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I'm used to heavy shedding so not a problem. Some barking is fine but not sure my coworkers would like that. Slobber is fine.

12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Quite important, I'd love walks in forests off leash from time to time.

Dog Personality and Behavior

13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly is better but not a dealbreaker.

14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Don't care as long as I can teach the dog the basics.

15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* Going to look what is going on, getting some pets. Some barking is okay at first.

16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No.

17. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Reactivity is the main thing. I just want some chill walks for once.

Lifestyle

18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Maybe for 4-5 hours once or twice a week.

1. 19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* It's just me. 

1. 20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* Nope.

1. 21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Nope.

1. 22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Own my own place. Neighbors are right next to us but I do have a small garden.

1. 23 What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Finland, everything is fine but some breeds are hard to find.

1. 24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer 15C to 30C, winter -5C to -30C.

Additional Information and Questions

25. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Having my 15 minutes with him is essential for me having a pleasant social life and I’m feeling like I get as much or more from my own urges walks as he does",1,1728110157.0
Road Trip with My Girl,"I am planning to drive to see family for Christmas this December in order to have my dog there for her first holiday and birthday since she was rescued. I work remote so I am planning to leave at the beginning of the month and return after the new year. I’ve done a long distance trip before but it was summer time and I didn’t have a dog with me. I am willing to travel south and around to avoid the dangerous mountain roads on I-90 if needed. I grew up in OH so I’m not a stranger to snow and I drive an AWD vehicle.

How to apologize to a dog,"I think I hurt my dog’s feelings and I want to make it clear to her that I feel bad, but I don’t know how dogs usually communicate that to each other.

Context: I’ve been seeing a lot of content lately about dogs’ body language and have been trying to pay close attention to my own dog’s since I haven’t had her all that long and I got her later in her life- I don’t know what she’s been through and I want to make it clear to her she can trust me. Sometimes I miss the mark though and I feel awful. 
I know this is all going to sound very bleeding heart, but it means a lot to me that she feels safe here. She used to live on the streets and I know she inevitably had some really negative interactions with humans. She’s the sweetest, most friendly dog and I want her to have the best life possible.

All that to say, tonight she had jumped on the couch next to me and seemed to be signaling that she wanted her belly rubbed. I obliged her, but since she was next to me and at a weird angle, it was kind of tough, plus I wanted to continue watching my movie. I pulled her into my lap so I could still pet her belly, and she immediately went stiff and tucked her tail. I tried to pet her for a bit to see if she’d relax, but eventually I stopped so she could leave if she wanted and after a bit she got down. She’s now asleep on the stairs curled up into the corner of the wall. I can tell she’s upset with me and I think it’s because I didn’t respect her space and autonomy.

Y’all can give your opinions on her reaction, but I know her well enough to know when she feels comfortable and when she doesn’t, so I’m pretty confident in my assessment of the situation. 
I’m only posting to see anyone has insight into dog behavior, and if so, if you can let me know how to make a clear apology to her.",1,1726457278.0
[BREEDS] Would greatly appreciate any recommendations for our family's next dog,"\*\*Introduction\*\*



1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?



\* We had a dog for 13 years. She passed away a year ago. I trained her with help from a professional trainer and really enjoyed the experience. I'd love to train our next dog on my own.



2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?



\* Preference is for rescuing, although we are open to a reputable breeder.



3)	Describe your ideal dog.



\* As a family with kids (ages 8 and 11), we all have different preferences but it seems the consensus would be: a loving family dog, medium sized (roughly), ""fluffy,"" intelligent/trainable, active but not extremely demanding (walks and playtime but not daily dog park trips). And low or no shedding would be great. We have a fenced in yard.



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



\* See above. The kids want an American Eskimo but I'm not sure that's a good fit. We had a border collie mix who was wonderful - only downside was the shedding. I think poodle mixes might make sense although I'm not sure the kids would be as excited about that - a close friend has a poodle mix and our kids don't seem that into it for some reason.



5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?



\* sit, stay, come, heel. Some fun tricks would be great but mostly we want the dog to be trained for safety reasons.



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?



\* Not necessary



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?



\* In terms of physical activity - daily walks or playtime, about 1 hour a day. And plenty of attention/affection at home.



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  



\* Daily walks or playtime in the yard, about 1 hour a day. Dog parks on occasion but not regularly.



9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?



\* We would probably wind up paying someone. We'd prefer not to have a dog that requires a lot of grooming at home (I know that might be at odds with the desire for a ""fluffy"" dog).



\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*



10)	What size dog are you looking for?



\* Medium



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



\* The less, the better. That said, our last dog was a big shedder and we loved her. But our preference is certainly for all these factors to be minimized.



12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



\* Not that important, although I do plan to train the dog.



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



\* Snuggly but not overly needy



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?



\* Either, as long as it's affectionate when the kids want affection



15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  



\* We're flexible. Our last dog was a great watch dog but we don't feel that's necessary. We do have kids over to play (ages 8 and up usually) so we'd hope the dog is chill about that.



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?



\* We don't plan to walk the dog off leash but we do live in an area with tons of dogs so this could be a problem.



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



\* Separation anxiety - we need the dog to be comfortable at home alone for a few hours.



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



\* One of us works at home so it's not a huge issue but we do need a dog that can be alone for a few hours.



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 



\* See above. We plan to have the kids take part in the care of the dog.



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



\* Currently no.



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



\* Yes, ages 8 and up.



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?



\* No plants to rent.



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?



\* USA (California)



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?



\* Southern California. Lows in the 50s/60s, highs up to 100. But we have AC and shade. 



\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*



25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.



\* No additional information.



26) Feel free to ask any questions below.",1,1728496248.0

Sick time cut off at 40 hours ,"Worked 37.5 hours, was sick last day of pay period. Turned in 37.5 work hours and 8 hours sick time.

I typically average 50 hours a week. Not wanting overtime but feel like I'm getting Shorted on my sick time.

Durable tug toy for spring pole?,"Hi there!

I am ISO a solid recommendation for a tug toy that I can attach to a spring pole that does not involve rope. I have heard too many horror stories of dogs getting their teeth caught using rope in this manner, and even though my pups will be supervised using it, I would still prefer to avoid it happening at all.

I tried a durable plush attached to a rope that I thought would work, but my AmStaff mix tore it apart in 10 seconds. 😅 They are also not a fan of nylon, so I'm kind of at a loss as to what to go with. Any advice would be appreciated!! ",1,1731369433.0
Breed recommendation,"**Introduction**

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I had multiple dogs when I was younger (family dogs mostly, until I left home around 17). We had mixed ruts, a poodle, and a German shepherd and lived in a rural area, so I don't have experience in an apartment/city. Most dogs were trained at home, but I went with the GW to professional training as it was a rescue with a high prey drive. She was perfect after. I also have a lot of experience training horses, stubborn donkeys and even cats! My wife doesn't have any experience although and I would like it to be a shared experience, so find a dog that is not too hard to start.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I'm ok with both, my wife is more reluctant about rescuing as she feels it's harder to find a specific breed. All my animals have been rescued.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

* medium-sized, affectionate while being independent / cat-like. Silly, not too barky (apartment situation), tendencies to be a couch potato but happy to go outside with us for a hike. Nice with cats, potty-trained already.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Silken windhound : They seem like silly noodles with a graceful personality, I do think they match a lot of the boxes for us except for cats (prey drive), but I had a good review about that with people buying them from breeders with cats. Keeshound are a close one too, except for their barking, but it can be from one to another. My wife likes Shiba and Akita Inu, but I think it would frustrate her a lot as a first dog lol.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Go for hikes and runs, be ok on car drives, enjoy time with us at home and be silly at times. Our cat loves dogs if they are chill and calm, it would be nice if they could go along too!

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* nope, mostly family dog, but with no kids.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I already get our cat on a leash outside every morning (30min), I run 3x to 5x a week (45min to 1h, but slow runs like 7 to 8km), we have parks and dog parks around, we usually go outside 2h per day or more, and I have a lot of free time at home for playing and training depending on the type of dog. So an easy 4 to 5h a day overall on weekdays and way much on weekends.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly, and does that include using a dog park?

* This has been mostly answered above, I'll just add that on the weekends we often go hiking (no very hard hikes, but still between 3 to 6h). We can give plenty of mental and physical stimulation, although our activities are mostly calm ones. We also love camping in wild areas!

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'd be very happy to do all of this, the cat is long-haired and already have her brushing sessions. As for grooming, I used to do it a lot for my poodle but I'd be happy to have a professional if needed. All my animals were trained to be fine with grooming which resulted mostly in a SPA moment for them.

**Personal Preferences**

10)What size dog are you looking for?

* medium, it's hard to have big dog in Quebec because of the landlords. I want a dog big enough to go on hikes but small enough not to dissuade our landlord.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Very ok with shedding, less with drooling and not so much with barking as we are in an apartment. (Although on the first floor so nobody under us)

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be really nice, but tbh there are not a lot of places like that in Quebec too. I sure prefer a close to perfect recall though.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* We like both, I find it harder when they have separation anxiety.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* A just middle would be perfect.

1. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* I would prefer them to not bark inside too much, I'd like them to not jump on people but not be aggressive. They don't have to like everyone.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Not so much.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Being territorial with us or aggressive to other. Being too prey oriented, separation anxiety prone to destruction. too high level energy and termite-like munching on everything.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* My wife and I both have flexible works so we can be at home when the other is at work. It could happen that they are alone for 4h to 6h as the bigger stretch but it will be exceptional, usually we will have a friend around.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* There is just my wife and my cat, they both like calm dogs that don't jump on them, are easy to be around and don't knock things over.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Just the cat for now.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We run a large apartment with big open spaces on the first floor in Quebec city. There is no direct restriction, dogs are allowed but I have to talk first with the landlord about the kind of dog I'd like to have to make my case.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Quebec

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* up to 30C in the summer, but mostly around 22C. Down to -40C in the winter but mostly around -15C I'd say. We see little whippets in the winter, might not be their cup of tea but they do well!

**Additional Information and Questions**

Which loan should I work on paying off first?,"I have multiple student loans with multiple lenders. My highest interest loan is $37,000 at 14.14% and my newest, probably most manageable one is $18,000 at 9.8%. I’m not sure which one to start working to pay off first. I could definitely pay off the $18k one within a year, the other I couldn’t.

In total I have about $130,000 in student loans with average interest of 11%. ~$13,000 are in federal so I’m not worrying about those right now. I tried refinancing about $70,000 but I was denied because my cosigner makes the same as me and their credit score is only slightly better.

    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * I would prefer large or medium but not against having a small dog either. X-large would probably not be ideal however.

    * That's about it.
    
    **Lifestyle**

Am I crazy for getting a third dog?,"I’m hoping there are some positive stories on this thread about owning three dogs. I have a 5 year old mini aussie and a 1 year old labradoodle. Next week I’m getting an 3 month Old English Sheepdog. For context, I live in a house by myself on a small farm, so plenty of land for them to run around. My parents live next door and are willing to help and my boyfriend is offering his support as well. 

My labradoodle loves other dogs and people so not too concerned about her, but my aussie is a bit of a jealous boy. He’s glued to me like velcro. But since he was fine with my doodle after a few months I’m hoping the same will be said for my OES. It’s obviously a risk though. 

I work from home, I make great money and I’m an introvert so my life revolves around my animals and I’m completely content with that. 

TLDR: I see too many online horror stories about people regretting the third dog. I’d really like to see some positive examples of it working out because it’s making me overthink this. 

Update: I got the pup and everything is going smoothly. It was a way harder transition going from 1 to 2 than 2 to 3. I have a very busy & loving household now! ",1,1730329937.0
prudent to finance a car at 0.9% APR w/36mo term?,"I'm deciding between lightly used car, or buying a new car and taking advantage of this dope interest rate.

Right up front - if this ends up being a bad bet, I'll still be able to make the payments, it will just be super annoying, so not so much a ""how much car can you afford"" question, but a ""how to maximize the use of $25-30K over 3 years"" question.

You may say, obviously the used car! but if prices are similar, a slightly more expensive new car, financed, may just be ""cheaper"" over the 3 year term, if I had that cash invested in a safe index fund, eg S&P 500.

can anyone help me do this math? or logic if it's totally obvious?

  
for the sake of example, let's say: 

used car at $25k OTD - still in warranty, less than 3yrs old, CPO

new car $30k OTD - financing at 0.9% for 36 months

$5K down, say (or should I put any down at all if not required?...) 

  
I have the amortization schedule (thank you Nerdwallet) to compare to, but... 

how do I determine what the opportunity cost of the difference is? I feel like this is some precalc that I hated in high school... but stick with me.

  
each month the ""principal balance"" is an amt I could have invested in an index fund rather than have paid cash for the whole car. This changes every month, of course.

Cost of loan ends up being less than $400 when all is said and done.

I feel like it's relatively safe to say an investment today in the s&p 500 will go up more than 0.9% over 3 years - though I know its possible it could be yo yo ing throughout the 3 years. I'll probably usually have $4-8K buffer cash in checking, so wont be forced to sell on one particularly bad day at least.

  
SO - having acknowledged that these numbers are all make believe, how can i determine, in the event of an  average 5% gain over 3 years, the real cost difference between financing and buying outright? Or is there a dope calculator site anyone can recommend? I thought I was brilliant just calculating the full principle, but obviously its a different amount each month. 

This must be something people weigh out all the time, no?

thanks in advance, fellow nerds :) ",0,1731638697.0

An intact dog keeps humping my dog at the park… what should I do?,"When we go to the dog park there is a small young poodle who keeps humping my dog, to the point that it’s almost obsessive and we leave.


This poodle isn’t desexed and in my opinion is poorly socialised.


The owner seems to think it’s funny and takes videos. She thinks it’s just some harmless domination…


My dog is double the size, but he is very sweet, playful, gentle and tends to be submissive. I don’t think he likes it at all.  He runs around initially (like it’s a game) but then he eventually will try to pin down the other dog.


My dog doesn’t seem to want to leave the park, but he rolls onto his back a lot. When this happens I end up pulling the humping dog off my dog so he can have a break. 


I don’t know the etiquette here, and I also don’t know enough about dog behaviour to know what’s really going on. 


My gut says my dog is overwhelmed and that this other dog should be leaving the park… but I just need some advice on dog behaviour before I start confronting people.


Thank you for your time and advice!


Edit: thank you for the replies! We have started going to a different dog park that’s a little further away but seems to have a good crew.

"Talk to me about the best, most ridiculously spoiled over the top dog beds","Our furry kids are getting new beds for Christmas this year. Their 20$ tractor supply bed is on the chopping block. I have two pups, one large and one xl, who are both spoiled out of their minds and I really want the best for them. 

The little one (65lb pit mix) absolutely loves to melt into a puddle of comfort. You will frequently find her in the middle of a pillow and blanket fort of her own creation on the couch. Her current bed is an ultra fluffy abomination of pink I found at Marshalls, which she honestly loves but it gets very stinky very quickly and it's tough to get properly clean. Will probably keep it anyway because she loves it but looking for something new and better she will like. She curls into a ball when she gets comfy most of the time, picture a baby deer sleeping and that's her.

The big one (100lb American bulldog) mostly prefers the couch or the king sized bed, which is fine, but there are occasions where I need him to stay on his own bed, so I'd like to make sure it's something comfortable for him. He's an older boy with arthritis in his back legs from old ACL tears, so comfort and support are a must. He's more of a stretching out boy when he sleeps, so something big enough to give him room to be comfortable is also important. 

Willing to spend to spoil these guys but I'd like the money to be worth the cost, not just buy the most expensive bed I can find. Ideally up to $300, can go as much as 500 if there's something miraculous.

[Breeds] Starting the search for a new companion after saying goodbye to my 17yo schnoodle,"\*\*Introduction\*\*

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* No. I have had dogs my entire life, literally since I was born, with the current 5ish months since my 17yo dog's passing being the longest I have gone without a dog. I was a kid when my family got most of our dogs, so I wasn't responsible for training them, but I did train my late 17yo boy and also helped with some training for a few other dogs. I'm admittedly likely a bit rusty with training a dog since my boy was an old guy when he passed, and so it's been a bit of time since I've had to actively train a dog.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

\* I am looking to rescue, but am thinking I may need to look at breed-specific rescues.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

\* I live in an apartment, so a dog suitable for apartment living is a must – not a ton of barking, not super super high energy. But aside from that, I'm really not picky, I love discovering dogs' individual personalities. I'd prefer an affectionate dog and one that is probably a bit lower or medium energy. I'm a homebody and a pretty laid back person, so would prefer a dog with a similar attitude, but one who is also up for the occasional adventure.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* I'm really interested in any and all breeds. I'm a life-long dog person and have had German Shepherds, English Springer Spaniesl, Brittany Spaniels, and schnoodles in my life. We're thinking that since we live in an apartment, a smaller or medium sized breed would be best, though.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Normal commands (sit, stay, lay, etc.)

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No. Just want a companion.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* I work from home, and my job is pretty laid back, so I can commit several hours a day and work on training, playing, etc. throughout the day.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* I am able to go on several shorter walks in the morning and during the day (around 15-20 minutes) and take them to my apartment's dog park in the evenings.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* Can do daily brushings. Did bi-monthly groomings (typically every 6-8 weeks) with my schnoodle, but also learned to start grooming him at home as he got older. Thinking that I would maybe prefer a pup that doesn't require quite as frequent groomings as my schnoodle did, but again, not opposed to it and am able to afford it.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)What size dog are you looking for?

\* While I would love a large dog, I think my current living arrangements are best suited for a small or medium sized dog.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* I'd prefer to keep shedding to a minimum, the quieter the better (live in an apartment, so have to be mindful of neighbors..but also ware that all dogs bark and make noise), and would prefer not a ton of slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Not at all important. I prefer to keep my dog leashed when in unfenced areas.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* I'm good with either, but would prefer one who likes affection.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* Again, not very picky. I've had experiences with both types of personalities, and have loved both.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* I'd prefer if they didn't bark with knocks on the door (again, live in an apartment). I don't mind if they get excited when greeting strangers and visitors, though I would hope to train them not to jump.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* I live in an apartment where there are many other dogs, so aggression towards other dogs isn't something I can have at the moment.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Not that I can think of. Really just want to avoid an agressive dog. Since we have a cat, we'd likely want a breed with a low prey drive as well.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* Rarely. I work from home, so they would have someone at home throughout the week. The only time they would be left alone would be for short periods of time on the weekends (probably like 2-3 hours at most).

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* ""hypoallergenic,"" (to whatever extent that's possible), but really just breeds with less shedding and pet dander, as my partner is mildly allergic, but willing to get allergy shots. They will be involved in daily care and training, but since I work from home, I would take on the bulk of the responsibility.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* We have a kitten. She was fostered in a home with dogs, so she spent the first few months of her life around dogs. She is the only other animal and is not at all shy Pretty sure she'd warm up to having a dog in the house pretty quickly. She's extremely rambunctious. We don't plant to get any more animals within the next few years after getting a dog.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No. The only time they would interact with children is when I go to visit my sister and her family (children ranging in age from 3-8) during holidays.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* We rent and will be renting for the next few years. Weight restriction is 80 pounds, breed restrictions are as follows (an include mixes with these breeds): pitbull, rottweiler, doberman, chow chow, great dane, akita, staffordshire bull terrier, american pitbull terrier, husky, Saint Bernard, shar pei, German shepherd, and Alaskan malamute. Generalized ""terrier mix"" and ""shepherd mix"" breeds should be avoided, we were just told.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* I live in TN, USA.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summers are hot, typically ranging from 80s to high 90s. Winters are typically mild in the mid-30s and 40s, with some days below freezing. We will be moving to New York within the next year or two, so we will have milder summers but more extreme winters once we move.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* Again, just want to stress that I currently live in an apartment, so I am attempting to get an idea of some breeds that may generally be better suited for apartment life. ",1,1730295744.0
Thoughts on portfolio consolidation ,"Wanted to get people's thoughts on consolidating my portfolio. 

Looking at my Robinhood portfolio, I have 5.79 shares of Microsoft and 7 shares of Apple that I've had for years. Haven't regularly contributed to them. Just collecting and reinvesting the dividends. 

I've moved more to mostly focusing on index funds. With that, does it make sense to sell my stakes in Apple and Microsoft and consolidate with my SCHD holdings for greater dividends? My logic is that I'm going to see a bigger snowball consolidated in SCHD than the gains and dividends that I'd see individually in Microsoft and Apple.

"I am in college and I don't need to work to support myself. However, I am in a decent amount of debt. Is working part time worth the added stress, or just focus completely on school?","I just started school back up again this fall and it's going well. Right now I make $3300 a month because of my GI Bill and VA disability. I also work part time as a CNA which brings around $600 an extra a month. I've worked there for too long and I'm debating on either not working at all next semester or trying a CNA job in the Cardio unit at the hospital. The only caveat is it would be 2 12 hour overnight shifts. 

My debt is a $15,700 personal loan at 18% interest. That is less than ideal, I know. Right now my minimum payment is not due until next June of $25. I think the reason is I've paid off $5,000 towards it since this summer, though I'm still paying it off with extra money. I won't start nursing school until 2026, and I'll most likely graduate December of 2027.

Part of me wants to take advantage of not having to work and just focus on school; after all of my expenses, including true expenses and sinking funds I still have $600 dollars to put towards my debt, so I could easily pay it off before I get my RN. That doesn't include the breaks and summer's off in between. On the other hand, this job could be great and I could pay it off faster while also having some extra income. I just don't want to juggle too much, as things have been going well this semester and nursing school will be challenging. I guess I have to figure out if I can trust myself to juggle the job/hours with school, or trust myself to stay disciplined with the budget without working. ",0,1731994679.0

Dog gets randomly terrified at specific spot on walks,"There's a spot at one of the alternative routes we take on walks where my dog just starts to panic and is clearly very afraid.

Now every time we get to within a few meters of that bush he panics.

Which will be less detrimental,"Long story short:

Husband is still on ex wife’s mortgage, although he did a quit claim deed when they divorced.  Ex was supposed to refinance within a year but she never did. Their divorce paperwork states she is fully financially responsible for the home which is what saved us when we were   purchasing our home. 

Ex is having financial difficulties paying her mortgage and got a call from the mortgage company to ask if hubby would agree to apply for a 3 month deferment on the mortgage.

 Would it be worse to sign and potentially have it reflect negatively on his credit as being unable to afford his bills (even tho he doesn’t pay toward that mortgage at all) OR does he not sign and let her fail and fall behind? 

For context-he didn’t bring up the topic of refinancing because he knew she wouldn’t qualify on her own and they used to share kids 50/50. Now we have full custody and they have a stable and safe home.  Also, she is in financial distress because she brought up a custody battle based on lies that the kids are being abused at our home by me and him. 🙄 We hired a lawyer and a Guardian Ad litem was appointed and those fees are close to 10K (each) so far…

She also has legal troubles with a felony case for keying a woman’s car over a parking spot so her lawyer bills are substantial.

Need Advice - Wanting to be Fiscally Responsible ,"I need some advice. One year ago I was homeless and directionless. For over two years, I had lived in a hotel and let depression and ill thoughts consume me. Long story short, got kicked out of hotel due to nonpayment.  Becoming homeless and being forced into survival mode was the best thing to happen to me. Life needed to get my attention, and I got to living. 

In 12 months, I went from $0 in savings and no job to getting back in school, $20K in savings, I am a mentor, and just got approved for a section 8 voucher. I make $2100 after tax, my current expenses are $850/month. I am enrolled with multiple programs that will help pay for upfront costs when I do get a place. 

I have 2.5 years left till I graduate. I want a vehicle, but I don’t know if I should get one. My job and school is within a 10 min bus ride of where I currently stay.  Starting fall quarter 2025, I will transfer to a university and the apartment I plan to get with section 8 will be very close to the university. I’m waiting for the section 8 voucher orientation (was told it could take 6 months due to back log of clients), which is fine. 

Should I get a car? I’m torn because one side of me is saying stay disciplined and save your money - Maxed out Roth IRA, I have 6 months of emergency funds, and investing in the stock market.  Getting a car would add at least $300/month to expenses (Gas, Insurance, saving for eventual maintenance costs). The other side of me is saying, get the car you want. Ford Fusion Energi and take advantage of the federal tax EV credit plus my state gives an EV credit as well. So I could save almost $5K on a car.

Moved to France. Should I move remaining USD to EUR? Withdraw relatively small retirement accounts? Trying to buy a house.,"Hello all, I'm hoping this is the right place/way to ask this.

I have almost zero knowledge about stocks, investments, etc. 5 years ago I moved to France from the US, and it is safe to say that I will not be moving back to the US. I'm working, married with a French woman, have a daughter. I have moved my entire life over here.

We are looking to buy a house here, and I am thinking that now is a good time to move my investments and USD to EUR. I was hoping for some advice. Also, general advice, as I see the USD is strong at the moment, buying 0.95€.

I have the following accounts:

* liquid/checking/savings: $1k, I've already been using this
* Invesco: $33k
* HSA: $7k
* 401k: $19k
* IRA: $3k

Moving Invesco incurs no fees, so that is a simpler question of just ""will it grow even more in the next few months?"". I'm leaning towards no, and to just go ahead and transfer that over, as an investment in a larger down payment for a house seems like a wiser choice.

The other accounts are all small retirement accounts. I know I would be hit with fees for withdrawing from them, but part of me wants to just go ahead and pull the money out and rip the bandaid off. what is more valuable, that $7k right now toward a house, or that money as and HSA in 32 years?

Or is that being too short-sighted? And it would actually be best to keep an investment vehicle in USD? Or save those retirement accounts for another 32 years (I'm currently 33)?

Any advice would be extremely appreciated.

Enrichment Suggestions for 4y/o Mix?,"I recently adopted a dog from my local shelter, and she has been a great addition!

Can we afford to move?,"Hi- turning to Reddit to help solve an argument (that’s always good, right?🤦‍♀️). Can we afford to move? I don’t have all the exact numbers so I’m going to overestimate expenses and underestimate income.

My husband and I are in our 30s. We own a 3 bed/2 bath house and that worked when we had 1 child but now we have 3 and I want to move to a larger house. We don’t have a very expensive lifestyle and we definitely avoid debt. We have just over $18,000 left to pay off on our house. The Zillow estimate for our house is $350,000. Not sure about the accuracy of Zillow estimates, but that’s the number. We have no other debt. All of our vehicles are paid off. We have credit cards, but we treat them as debit cards and never carry a balance.

As far as income, he is the primary income. His pre-tax base pay is $125,000 but he has the option of working overtime and he does sometimes and he gets a yearly performance bonus. My income is more variable. I work part time on weekends so we don’t have to pay for childcare. I had a baby this year so I didn’t work for 3 months but I’m on track to bring in $16,050. We fully contribute to retirement, we have 529 plans for each of our kids, and we have savings.

As an example, I’m looking at new construction that’s $560,000. If we can net $300,000 from our current house and use that as a down payment, a mortgage calculator shows me that at 6.77% our monthly payment would be less than $2,200. This current builder is advertising lower rates if we finance through them and when I plug that in, it shows an estimated monthly payment of $1,873/month. 

Can we afford this? If I bring this up, my husband looks at me like I’m crazy. He says I have no idea how expensive it is to move on top of “doubling” what we pay now (our current mortgage payment is $1,200 which I think is really reasonable). It’s true, this is our first house so I have never gone through the process of selling a house. Am I being unreasonable thinking we could afford to do something like this?

**My two major questions**

* Do I have too much invested in cash today? Should some of this now be moved over to the market.
* Curious if any other landlords see this and think of the property. It's an atypical situation, but good equity built, low interest loan, new property, and neighborhood does have strong outlook over the next decade. However, not yielding a ton of cash flow. Cash flow really is covering unexpected maintenance that could arrive, but investment doesn't cost me personally anything.

Does a dealership really HAVE TO run your credit? ,"I'm shopping around for a new SUV. I'm not in a rush though and I have already been preapproved for a loan through my credit union. I literally just have to give them a check for the SUV from my bank. The credit union I have has very competitive rates and are ALWAYS lower than anywhere else due to it being a not for profit bank for educators. Dealership lenders have NEVER beat my credit union rates. The last 3 vehicles I have bought this way and it's been the quickest car buying experience. The last dealership I went to I did not have a good experience, quick but not very professional. I kept getting hassled into having my credit checked, I repeatedly said my bank always beats dealership rates. Explained the type of bank it was and still; they wanted to run my credit. I ended up letting them because I wanted to get out of there with the SUV I wanted. Is there a law that says they NEED to run credit if pre approved for outside lending? I get verifying identity due to vehicle theft butrunning credit? Idk. ",0,1731785037.0
Looking for a resource to learn basics & debunk myths,"I'm looking for a book / website / other resource to learn the basics of financial literacy, SPECIFICALLY one that debunks the following myths, along with any similar myths that I may accidentally be believing.

* In my 20s, I thought that the only risk-free place to put extra funds was a savings account. In my 30s, I learned a high-yield savings account is basically the same thing but with much higher interest. (There are other differences, but none that matter to me.)
* In my 20s, I procrastinated choosing a retirement company, because I thought: 1) it would be a really difficult decision, 2) I couldn't easily switch companies once the funds were invested, and 3) it needed to be compatible with any accounts created by past employers (which I'd lost track of). When I finally bit the bullet and started researching companies, I learned that: 1) The decision was easy because only a few companies have low minimum balance requirements, 2) I can easily transfer funds between companies in the future, as long as the account types are the same, and 3) Past 401(k) accounts can be consolidated, but there's no rush to do that before depositing to a Roth IRA.
* In my early 30s, I thought I could withdraw from my Roth IRA at any time, with the only downside being that I couldn't replenish it if I withdrew more than the yearly maximum. I didn't realize that withdrawing before retirement age would require me to pay a 10% tax on the withdrawn amount. (Edit: Based on the comments, it seems the mistake I made here was trusting Betterment to accurately determine my tax obligations. They withheld 10% when they probably shouldn't have.)

That list is long enough to make me wonder if I'm making even more mistakes. It would be reassuring to find a resource that addresses those topics in particular, to help me trust that I'm not making additional errors of this kind.

(Alternatively, I've considered consulting a financial advisor, but lots of blogs say that only makes sense after you have 100k in savings. Let me know if you disagree!)",0,1732464131.0
Almost 50% on rent? Seeking advice for a single person.,"Hi folks!

I’m moving for a new job, and my after-tax income will be $4,300/month. I’m single, no dependents, and my company fully covers health insurance, so that’s not a concern.

I’ve found a place close to work that I really like—it’s in a great area and would make my commute super convenient. The catch is that housing plus all utilities and internet would cost $2,400/month. 

I know the typical advice is to keep housing around 30% of your income, but I feel like this could be worth it for the location and quality of life. I don’t have any debts. I am moving from outside US, so I am not sure on how much I need to afford other expenses.

Would this be a bad financial decision? I’d appreciate any guidance from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or has insights on whether this seems feasible long-term.

No preference.					
					
Describe your ideal dog.					
					
A companion, I can take any and everywhere. 					
					
What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?					
					
Shihtzhu seems to be at the top of my list when it comes to what I'm looking for. The breed is okay with a smaller space and can be taken everywhere.					
					
What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?					
					
Potty and crate trained. Basic sit, lay down, wait, fetch.					
					
Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?					
					
no.

Small, would like to be able to grab my dog and go.

I would like my dog to alert me that someone is knocking. I'm okay with my dog greeting strangers as long as I am comfortable.

Fixed income in inherited Roth.,"I am 62 and semi-retired with a low income and spread-out investments.

I recently inherited a Roth (non-spousal) which has to be closed about 8 years. It comprises about 4% of my portfolio. Right now it is in FFRHX which I guess I would consider fixed income because my parent used these dividends to pay specific expenses.  I could certainly use it to pay my healthcare premiums. If I did that I realize there will be very little tax-free growth, but I will have guaranteed coverage of an important expense. 

I do have an hourly-based financial advisor who helped me transition things after the passing of some family members. He wants me to give money to a guy who doesn't even really know exactly where it gets invested. On one hand my portfolio is too small for them to spend time going into a lot of nitty gritty details so I'm asking around.

Debating whether or not to pay off my car ,"I have about $6K in savings and my monthly car payment is $500 at 2.9% + $500 monthly insurance currently paid in full until January. The insurance should come down as a ticket falls off but Im not holding my breath. I owe $3400 and the car will be paid off in a few months. My monthly expenses come out to roughly $3100 including housing and essential goods. I have about $1k CC debt at 0% paying about $230 monthly, I can cut that to minimum payments but I would like it gone quickly. I have no other debts or financial obligations. I currently make $3400 monthly that will be cut to $3000 in January.

My concern is that my dog needs surgery and I will be paying between $6000-$8000, so I will likely need to take a loan to pay for it. The surgery is completely non negotiatable for me.

My options are:

1) Use my entire savings to pay for as much of the surgery as possible.

2) Pay off my car and use the remainder of my savings to pay as much of the surgery as possible and take a loan for the rest.

3) Don't pay off the car, pay half the surgery, and take a loan for the remainder.

I'm leaning very heavily to number 3. I'm very hesitant to drain my savings, especially since I will be needing to move out in February and need the money as a security deposit. Absolute worst case scenario is that I need to stay where I am. I am only moving because I hate my neighbors (shouting as I typing this). Not to mention that I will not be able to build my savings again very quickly leaving me feeling vulnerable.

I can possibly slash my expenses down to the absolute bare minimum along with doing 10-20hrs overtime weekly, however I will likely also be draining my mental health severely by doing so and now is not a good time with other things going on in my life, not least of which my injured dog.

Any advice or insight is appreciated. I'm likely going to just have to tough out the overtime but I still want to consider any options.

Lost my dog to GDV,"My poor girl 17 Shih Tzu Bichon mix, just work up one moring in pain. And with the closest Emergency vet 30 mins away. We ran out of time. Vet said she had little to no chance of surviving the needed surgery and was put down.

After researching and learning what GDV even is now, I can't help but look back and blame myself for not catching any of the early warning signs.

It also happened close to the start of new prescription food for a bladder stone. I also wonder if that triggered anything, and if I killed her by giving her it.

I just can't stop crying and blaming myself. And regret not maximizing my time and attention to her. Like watching TV or playing games or just working too much. All that time could have been spent for more walks and adventures with her.

Going through and storing, donating, or throwing away her old things feels so painful. Like I'm deleting my best friend's existence. She was my daily reason to go outside to a park, or hang out and maintain the backyard for her. With living on my own, I have zero reasons or motivation now go outside. And doing anything to make myself happy feels wrong and selfish with out her. I haven't been able to eat much, since we would have meals at the same time and I would always share a little with her.

Pay off Student Loans or bulk up E-fund?,"Hi there, long time lurker. I generally understand finances well but I need some outside perspective on what my current goals should be. Here are the stats:

I am 27 years old. I started getting my budgeting shit together when I was around 24 after making a series of poor financial decisions and did the snowball method to pay off several debts along with some Dave Ramsey advice which I have started to move away from. I use YNAB religiously but I do splurge occasionally on dining out, giving gifts, but I have never paid a lick of interest on my credit cards. 

Take home pay: $4k/mo

Expenses: $3k/mo average but if I scrimp, forego therapy sessions, etc. would be $2.5k/mo

Any remaining funds that I did not account for are usually going into budget categories for gifts, vacations, taxes, etc. Probably about $1k that floats around, gets used up and refills.

Debt: 

$8k on 2019 Kia Niro EX Hybrid, \~1.5 years left on loan at 6.5%, $475 monthly payment

$1.2k on student loans at 4.2%, started with \~$25k and am almost free! :) I put $700 a month towards this currently. Normal payment of about $70/mo.

Savings:

$23k in retirement (I know I am behind, wanted to pay off debt before aggressively saving for retirement. I get a 6% match on my 401k ($78k a year salary) and contribute about $50/month to other stock options thru acorns.)

$5k liquid savings for a 2-month emergency fund. 

So here is where I need help. Do I bulk up my emergency fund to 6 months before continuing to pay off my student loan? The amount of interest it will be gaining in that time is pretty low. I don't have a ton of wriggle room as it stands although my long term partner makes more than enough to support us in a pinch ($130k) though I do not rely on him for anything financially. Maybe I'm approaching it the wrong way and should be paying down the car first?

16-week-old puppy too late for socialization?,"Hi fam,

I’m considering adopting sporting breed pup from a reputable breeder (CHIC certified parents, lower litter count, strong application process, etc). Here’s the catch: they offered up (and I think I’m excited about) one of their 16 week old doggos. 

The main consideration I have is that I live in a rather urban area (not NYC, but loud cars here and there, lots of people) and the breeder is in a rural area. This will be a first dog for me. I worry that adopting so old in that circumstance, they might not have the socialization opportunities to be comfortable in this environment.

Is this a bad idea?

In some ways it alleviates one of my challenges - parvo isn’t *not* a concern in my area and I live in a condo without a dedicated yard. I had a strategy to solve for that until vaccination (friend yards and a backpack/stroller for socialization). But overall I want to make sure I give a dog an opportunity it needs to feel comfortable in the (urban, busy) environment it’ll be in much of the time for the next few years.

What thoughts do you all have? I know to ask the breeder more about what socialization has been done, but curious what people’s takes are here.

"[RIP] Lilly, Parti Poodle, 14","Hi everyone. I'm having a hard time coping with the loss of my 14-year old lady today. 

My parents and I got Lilly when I was 21, and she's been a major part of my life since then. Lilly was there for me through a lot of major milestones in my life, and I've been so blessed to have been able to spend tons of time with her since COVID ever since I was able to start WFH. Although I wouldn't say we were inseparable, seeing Lilly was like clockwork for me; always reliable, and always around the same times each day.

Lilly was my heart and soul. She had such character that you couldn't help but fall in love with her very quickly. Lilly was so easy to love on, and was so active and fun; I feel incredibly blessed to have had her in my life all these years. I wish I could have had her longer. 

Lilly's health started going downhill this past August, and since then part of me knew my days with her were numbered. I was really hoping she would have made it through this upcoming winter, but that wasn't meant to be. My parents and I recently returned from vacation, and I was the first one to make it home two hours after my aunt and uncle had gone home. While she was alone, we think she suffered a stroke, because she was disoriented and unable to eat or walk straight without bumping into walls or getting stuck in small spaces. Lilly spent the last three-and-a-half days fighting for every breath, and we hoped that she would start to recover with everything we could reasonably try, such as additional medication, fluids administered by IV, even a low dosage shot of ketamine into her back. Finally, this morning we took her to the vet to put her to rest. We couldn't bare to see her suffer any more than she already had for us. She passed away at 10:53 AM.

Everyone I've talked to about this today says it was the kindest thing we could have done for her. Although I can agree, every fiber of my being feels like it's on fire with wanting to get her to come home. Lilly was lost to us days ago, today was just a final insult. 

I only hope I can see her again someday. I love you so much, Lilly. I always will.

I have very little cash savings, but do have $500k in 401k, home equity of about $300k (30 year interest rate is 3.1% so I'd rather not refinance). My $3k mortgage covered property tax and home insurance. Estimates on CalCovered (health insurance) is $2,000 for a family of 5. I suspect that would be reduced if I'm unemployed? I need a minimum of $6-7k/ month to cover necessities. No car payments, very little credit card debt. Been working since I was 16 and this is totally new to me and very anxious. My wife was a stay-at-home mom and is now looking into getting back in the workforce.

My question if I stay unemployed. What's the best way to navigate my retirement money. I'm just preparing for the worst and have 6 weeks to figure this out. Appreciate any recommendations.

Additional information - EDIT  
I am collecting unemployment.   
I am trying to find any job regardless of industry or pay.   
I am willing to take on part time/ gig jobs/ neighborhood help, etc.   
I have looked at budgeting and have eliminated non-essentials. I could do better.   
I have until end of year for severance and health insurance, but I think I can squeeze 3 more months to Q1. 

I need to get back to hustling and will come back to the thread tonight. Man, I can't thank you all enough for the suggestions, the encouragement and just the overall time you all have put in to help out a stranger. Lots of thanks and gratitude!",0,1731949228.0
How do I train my puppies to play fetch?,"I have 2 toy poodles who are 5 months old.

They really like the toy because whenever I decide to just get the toy from the floor they suddenly want to play with it.

"Started investing recently, would love to hear opinions on my portfolio! ","I am 24, and only recently got the interest and urge to start investing. Started off with a HYSA a couple months ago, which I threw majority of my earnings I had saved up in my checking account. But since I’m brand new to this whole concept, I initially invested $700, and this is how I’m doing it:

$500 for individual brokerage.
- Currently sitting as cash with Fidelity, which I believe is stored as a Money Market Fund, so I’m going to leave it as that for the time being and let it accumulate interest while I learn more about stocks.

$200 for my Roth IRA
- $120 (60%) in FXAIX 
- $40 (20%) in FZROX
- $40 (20%) in FSPGX

I plan to invest $100 or more every month into the Roth IRA, just to max it out as much as possible of the allowed contribution.

Please be honest, I would love to know if this is the right track. I’m continuing to read up and learn, also thinking of purchasing the book “The Simple Path to Wealth” by JL Collins soon, as I’ve heard great things about it.

"My first dog, Beck, passed over the rainbow bridge unexpectedly this morning. Nothing prepared me for this day. ","He was 9 years old and a big mixed-breed pupper (100lbs) so I knew this day was coming sooner than later. I just wish he had more time. I didn’t get to be with him when he passed on our couch in the early morning hours and am still in shock. We got him when I just turned 30 and bought my first house. He taught me so much about life and was always so sweet and gentle. I never knew I could love an animal as much as I loved him.

His last full day yesterday was spent getting his morning treats/vitamins after giving his obligatory loves and kisses, laying on the sofa with his younger brother Otto barking at the mailman and lawn workers across the street, visiting me at my desk while I was working from home to tell me its time for a break, getting a dinner of kibble topped with string cheese chunks and pepperoni, and finally going on a nice evening walk around the neighborhood. 

I love you Beck and will always have a place in my heart just for you. You were the bestest boy and I just hope you went peacefully in your sleep. I didn’t deserve you, but you made sure to remind me every day that I did.

Help me decide if I should buy a cheap house or keep renting? ,"My (27F) fiancé (28M) and I are moving to a new area in August 2025, and planned to rent for about until 2028 in the new area while we save up money for a down payment for our “forever home” (~400-600k budget). 

HOWEVER, we’ve recently realized that in the area we are moving to, rent ranges from $1650 - $2600 per month. 

We are considering buying a cheap house ~$170k hoping the mortgage will cost around $1,200 per month. Even with additional cost for upkeep and repairs (maybe $300/month ish), this would be equal to the lower end of the cost of rental in our area, AND we would be gaining equity. 

Is it wise to buy this cheap house when our true goal is to buy a “forever home” in 2028? 

Factors: 
- Dual income will be ~$310k per year pre-tax 
- Dual debts (school loans) ~13.5k per year 
- Need to purchase a new car ASAP ~20k 

SPECIAL FACTORS
- Due to his profession, my fiancé will be able to qualify for a special kind of mortgage where he can do 0% down on his first home. I’m having a hard time thinking it is worth it to “use up” this amazing deal on a cheap ~170k home, instead of using it on our more expensive forever home. So, if we do buy a cheaper home, would it be wise for me to purchase it in my name only in 2026 (pre-marriage)? Will he still be able to use the deal on his “first” home after we marry in 2027? 

TIA for any input/ advice and please let me know if I can provide better information! ",0,1732240252.0
International travel from EU to USA ,"I brought my two large dogs to live with me and my husband in Greece in January of this year. He works for the military and we were supposed to stay for 3 years but the military decided to be it's usual self and now we're very last minute being sent back to the US. 

I still have all the health certificates, rabies, and other paperwork from their original flights to Greece. We're trying to fly back but military is saying we need to send our dogs back with a pet shipping company. They're all quoting 5k-12k! They're also saying none of our documentation matters and we need to see ""their"" vets for new paperwork. That sounds crazy to me. 

What do y'all think? We have the health and rabies certificates from January and stamped from a military vet clinic. I can maybe see needing an updated health certificate but new everything else?? It all sounds suspicious especially with them all claiming we'd need to buy new crates as ours will be turned away. But I brought them into Greece in those crates and had no issues. 

I'm just so confused and feel like we're trying to be pressured into paying higher costs by multiple pet shipping companies. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1729768531.0

Getting End of the Year Bonus - Please help me decide which CC debt to put it toward,"Made stupid decisions in my early 20's. I ended up accumulating $36,000 in credit card debt. I was making over $240,000/year paying off all CC monthly until I lost my job and was unable to find work for over a year and a half. My new job is not even half the salary of my previous one making around $95,000/year with bonuses. I have changed all spending habits and changed my mentality after the lifestyle creep. CC have all been cut up and placed on holds. Once balances are all paid off I plan to close the cards (only ones with high AF that no longer serve a purpose as I am not traveling like I used to). 

I am going to be getting a $10,000 end of the year bonus from my job soon and I am trying to figure out where to put that extra cash. I am currently doing the debt snowball to pay off the lowest balance first but wondering if this is the smartest move. 

  
numbers are approximate

1 -$3,000 - 27.49% 

2 - $4,000 - 27.74%

3 - $6,000 - 28.49%

4 - $9,000 - 28.74%

5 - $14,100 - 28% 



My plan is to pay off the $3,000 using the regular debt snowball method. Whatever is extra has been helping to significantly lower the balance on that one. However, I am concerned that the $14,000 cc will be racking up so much interest over time by the time that I get to it solely due to the balance of it. The interest rates are relatively similar so wondering if it would be a good idea to pay off the smallest credit card and then put the entire bonus into the $14,100 cc to minimize the interest accrued on it or stick to debt snowball and use a",0,1731748540.0

"Seeking Financial Advice: Overwhelmed by Debt, Living Paycheck to Paycheck","Hi,

I’m reaching out for advice because my wife and I are struggling to get ahead financially and feel like we’re stuck in a cycle we can’t break. Here’s our situation:
	•	Debt: ~$16,000 in credit card debt, $40,000 in student loans, and $30,000 remaining on our car loan.
	•	Housing: We rent in Southern California for $1,800/month (cheapest rent in our area), plus $300–$600 in utilities depending on the weather.
	•	Income: I’m in my second year as a junior high graphic design teacher, making about $82,000/year. This includes extra income from an after-school program and selling my prep period. My wife is currently not working because we just had our second child. She plans to start substitute teaching soon, but we’re hesitant about her pursuing a full-time teaching credential due to the cost.

A few years ago, we filed for bankruptcy after falling into a similar situation with credit card debt. We promised ourselves we wouldn’t let it happen again, but we made financial plans assuming we’d both be working as teachers. After having our second child, our savings were depleted, and now we’re living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the monthly minimum payments with very little after paying our bills. Not to mention state pay is once a month so we really have to budget.

We desperately want to get out of this situation, but we’re overwhelmed and don’t know where to start. How can we tackle our debt more effectively and create a realistic plan to get back on track? Are there programs or resources that can help? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

What breed for a couple and possible future kids?,"Hello 
My boyfriend (26) and I (29) have just bought a house and, with time, would like a dog. I'll use the template to answer some questions. 

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes and no. - it'd be our first dog as adults. 

My boyfriend grew up with a Golden Retriever as a boy till she passed away when he was 22. 

I mostly had cats growing up. My mom adopted a cockerspaniel from a friends family, when I was about 11 years old, which we had for a couple of years till we gave him away to an older couple (because of financial and time issue)
My dad was a dog-trainer in the military but quite the job shortly after I was born. He's had German Shepherds. He got a puppy when I was about 8, but he had to give her away after 2-3 years as his work hours got in the way.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I'd prefer a breeder just because it seems more ""safe"". Both terms of the dogs history and being well socialized, but I've kept an eye on rescue centers too - If we're a good match the breed doesn't matter.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Loving, family dog. It doesn't have to be super outgoing but should be okay around strangers - Not a guard dog!

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I've always loved Collies! Besides that German Shepherds, Bernese Mountain or Golden Retrievers. 
Just smart, cooperative and kind dogs.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Besides the basics it would be nice with some fun tricks. But I'd like good control such as stay command and being able to walk pretty far away. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Maybe agility or obedience just for fun. Possibly some herding of hens which I'd like to have with time - but again just for fun.  

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Besides the daily walks- 15 min of play or training. 

But I also except it to be part of the family in everyday activities - hang out in the garden, visit friends or eating outside a cafe. Especially on weekends.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

At least an hour a day - 20 min morning, afternoon and evening. It'd be walks in the forrest just by our house and in suburban areas. In the weekends I'd hopefully do longer trips - to the ocean. There's no dog parks in my area I'm aware of. 

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Adviced by my dad, I would brush everyday for 2-5 min while on our walk rotating areas. Grooming and cutting hair I'd leave up to professionals 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to big. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

None or little barking. Shedding is okay - I'm used to it. Slobber preferably not.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not important but would like reliable recall. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I love snuggly and cuddly pets! 
But I want a no-bed/couch rule. If cuddles happen I'd lay on the floor or the grass.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please. 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Fairly calm. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I'd do my best and seek help

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Stubbornness and excessive barking.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

6-8 hours 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

There will hopefully be kids in our future. 
Our parents will be able to help taking care of the dog. They retire soon and could watch it some days we are at work. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I want a cat(s) and as mentioned a coop with hens in the backyard.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes. Of all ages.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Denmark. ""Fight dogs"" aren't allowed but I'm not interested in those breeds. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

From -5 C to 25 C -ish. Quite rainy and sometimes snow

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I'm currently studying biology and my BF works 37 hours a week. In 3-4 years I'll work 30-37 hours a week.
 
Our house has a 1,000 m^2 garden by a lake. The neighbors have kids so likely some distraction and noise.

I have ADHD and generally mental health issues. Having pets defiantly helps me. Taking care of them makes me take better care of myself. They rely on me having a rutine which helps me in return. 
I haven't had a cat in 8 years, since it's not allowed in our apartment, and I really miss having a pet. They've helped me through some dark times. I believe a dog would be extra good for me as it needs me to take it for walks - which helps me mentally too. 
So a dog breed good with people who have those struggles would be lovely.

Refund sent to closed card?  Bank and merchant both not taking responsibility.,"Hi all, thanks in advance for your help and advice.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this on, but my situation is as follows:

On Sept 28 I paid for something.  On October 14, I closed the account/debit card that I used to make that purchase.  On October 21, I was issued a surprise refund for my original payment, and the refund went to the now-closed card I paid with originally.

I have been on this month long back and forth between the merchant and my bank, trying to get the refunded money sent to an active account.  The problem is, the merchant no longer has the funds they sent out for my refund, and the bank has no record of those funds arriving.  In other words, the merchant doesn't have the money and neither does the bank--the funds didn't even bounce once they reached the closed debit card.  Every time I contact the merchant, they tell me to contact the bank to return the funds.  Every time I contact the bank, they tell me to contact the merchant because they can't even file a dispute on funds that don't exist.  I am out of ideas on what else to do or who else to call; I'm expecting a call from merchant leadership in a few days to try and discuss the matter further, but does anyone have any idea on what I can do to get this sorted out?  I have copies of the bank statement showing that the funds didn't arrive, and I have a copy of the refund statement saying the funds were sent.  I just have no idea who I can hold responsible for this problem since everyone is pointing fingers, or what I can say to them to make someone take this seriously and figure out where the money went.

Breed Recommendation: Medium / First Time Adult Owner,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First as an adult/primary caregiver. Owned dogs growing up as a child, but never on my own.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I am open to either option. Prefer to rescue if the fit is right. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Medium in size (40-55~ lbs) - Friendly with people/animals, likes to be active, but doesn't require non-stop attention and can be okay on their own.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Aussies due to their size/activity and smarts. Labs (though typical size could be a bit more than wanting). ""Spitz"" breeds due to the fox like appearance (Finnish Spitz, Icelandic Sheepdog, etc.)

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Primarily the basic commands (come, sit, leave it, down, etc.) - good leash manners. Fetch/catch. Not really looking for agility training/sporting activities. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No work/sporting plans. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Multiple hours. I work from home and tend to have pockets of time throughout my day to interact with the dog each day. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours (as weather allows) - I am rather active and take a large number of walks each day. This would include dog park activities as some are near me.

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I would like to do as much of this myself within reason. For tasks outside of my skillset I would pay professionally. Ideally no more than monthly/every few months. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium (thinking 40-55ish lbs) 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I am okay with shedding as I know what I am signing up for. Prefer less barking/slobbering.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This would be nice, but also not a show stopper. I have a fenced in back yard of decent size, and city-ordinance is on-leash in all public areas. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Mix of both? Not looking for super clingy/velcro 100% of the time, but don't want 100% aloof either. A healthy mix would be nice

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Similar to above, a mix would be ideal, but realize that might be asking too much. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Calm but cautious? Definitely not aggressive or fearful. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. Many other dogs in my area and wouldn't want to cause an issue. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Overly aggressive. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Vary depending on the day, but working from home they wouldn't be left alone often. I would plan to take the dog on any extended trips. Handful of hours every now and again.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone (no kids/partner that lives with). I do have a girlfriend that also has a dog (2.5 year old Aussie). 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* None of my own, or that live in the house. Girlfriend's Aussie that they would interact with

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I do not rent. Own my home with a fenced in back yard. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Nebraska - and my city does not have any breed-specific dog bans. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Average in July - 89 F

new balance transfer or interest-only HELOC?,"In 2023 I bought a roof & fence. Half of this was via interest-only HELOC at 8.5% (10 years interest only, if it matters). The other half I paid for with credit card convenience checks at 0% interest for 15 months with the idea of not accruing interest right away the way I did with the HELOC portion. Used an existing credit card with an offer, didn't open a new account.   
  
I have been paying what I can towards that 0% card while being more aggressive with paying the 8.5% HELOC interest and principal.

But that 15 month 0% APR is expiring, the high CC rates will kick in, and I don't have any existing CCs with a 0% or low % for transfer. Plus the transfer fees are 4-5% of the balance, which could be up to $750 with the $15k I'm looking to move.

**Am I better off:**   
1. getting a new credit card with a 0% balance transfer offer and playing this game for another year WHILE dinging my credit score and paying the transfer fee. 

2. using HELOC funds at 8.5% to pay off the credit card and put the balance on the HELOC. This was my original plan all along, but wondered if there were better options.

Is there a dog breed that would be suitable for me?,"**Introduction**

Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First dog, although I grew up with dogs

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Rescuing - I can't afford a dog from a good breeder on a $30k salary

Describe your ideal dog.

* Small, friendly, easily trainable, good with cats, low grooming needs, and doesn't bark a lot

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Pomeranians, toy-sized Mini Aussie, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic tricks

Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day

* 30 minutes on weekdays, an hour on weekends

How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* 30 minutes - walking (just on the street, not a dog park) and playing indoors

How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I brush my cats every two weeks or so and would do the same for my dog. I can also trim nails. I don't want to pay a professional.

**Personal Preferences**

What size dog are you looking for?

* Toy-sized

How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Plenty of shedding, not much barking or slobber. I'm not allowed to have more pets on my lease so barking would be an issue in that regard. My landlord is offsite and didn't notice that I had an extra cat for six months though even though he'd sit in my window, so the chances of this being an issue are very slim.

How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important as I don't have an unfenced area

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please

How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* I'd want them to be calm -- little barking and no jumping up or other wild behaviors.

Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression towards cats -- I'd have to rehome in this case

**Lifestyle**

How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 10 hours a day on weekdays, 0 hours typically on weekends. I work from 7 am to around 5 pm on average. I could cut it down to 9 hours sometimes. There's no way I could go home midday.

What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* N/A - I live alone

Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Two cats

Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent. Dogs have to be under 50 lbs. I'm also not permitted to have another dog on my lease since I already have two cats, but as I said the landlord lives across the city and this is very unlikely to be an issue as long as the dog doesn't bark and annoy my neighbors.

What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA and no

What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* 90s in the summer, 40s in the winter

**Additional Information and Questions**

Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I could potentially leave my dog with my parents (they live right next to my job) during work. They have a fenced yard and a very friendly Aussie, and my mom's a former vet tech so she's great with dogs. I'd prefer a dog who'd be okay with being alone for 10+ hours though. I don't mind training them to use a pad. I'm also very used to having cats and I've always been a cat person (plus I know they fit my lifestyle better), but I like the idea of having a dog. I never go hiking or go on walks or anything and I think a dog would push me to do more of that.

Looking for the best option with low credit and 55k in debt,"Hello,

I was looking for advice for my situation. My credit score is in the low 600s and I have about 55k in debt that is taking a significant toll on my monthly income. The total amount I pay monthly is about $1800. I have been denied consolidation loans because of my credit and debt amount and I came across a debt settlement company that would offer me a payment closer to $1000 a month. They explained to me that this would have a negative impact to my credit score but that it would start to rebound in the months following the start of the program. They couldn't tell me how much my score would go down but in my mind I'm wondering if it's worth it with my score already being so low- I don't have any plans for any large purchases anytime soon. 

  
I have never had to pursue anything like this so I am hoping someone with more experience could give me some guidance.

My sister very recently lost her fur baby. It has really hit her hard, she was her best friend and got her through some really tough times. 

Instead of printing off some photos or getting a keyring made or one of those gifts to remember her, I thought I would create a scrapbook. The difference being that it is full of drawings of her 🙂. I hope it will still be a great memory but with a twist!

Divorce payout options - HELOC or Cash out refi?,"Hi all - unfortunately, I am in the final stages of finalizing my divorce with my wife. The likely outcome is that I'll need to find a way to pay her out \~50k usd. I have a few options, but touching the 401k is generally frowned upon so I'm hoping someone can provide some guidance on the best path forward.

Current mortgage: 181k owed at 2.75% APR (no, I can't keep the rate. The mortgage is not assumable)

Monthly payment (principal, PMI, escrow, etc): $1300  
Cash needed: 50k USD

I'm approved for a HELOC @ 10.5% APR with a 15year draw/15year repayment window.  
This comes out to roughly $437/month during the draw period, and $552 during repayment.

Would it make more sense to do this or a cash out refinance, as I will need to put the home in just my name anyhow? My credit today could be better (thanks divorce) but I was estimating roughly 6.7% APR at 231k.

Much appreciated

Prednisone - Urination,"Prednisone - Urination

I feel like I’m going crazy handling the side effects of my girl being on prednisone. She’s very well house trained but with the volume of water she is drinking she can’t get through the night without several accidents right in front of the door to go outside. I wake up every 2 hours to take her out but it’s still not enough. Our washer just broke on top of this so I’m running out of clean up options as we’ve been drying with a towel then mopping. I’m also unable to leave the house for more than a few hours during the day time or else she has an accident. I show horses and I don’t know what I’ll do this season when I have to be gone over night for shows as my bf works long hours where he can’t visit home and all of my friends who could help will be at the shows with me. I love my girl so so much and would literally stop the world for her but I’m going crazy and have lost so much needed sleep. 

Here’s our setup:

We have 3 cats and our 1 dog.

My ideas have been

1. Pee Pads on the floor where she’s been going right in front of the door.

Cons: I don’t want her to start thinking soft surfaces are ok to pee on as she has only been being on the hard floors so far and I rent so don’t want to risk a caret accident. I also don’t have faith in the pee pads to hold enough liquid for me to be able to sleep through the night.

2. Dog diapers over night.

Cons: Like the pee pads I’m not confident they would hold enough volume. I also don’t want to risk this being the case then her laying and walking around the house and then having pee everywhere rather than just the one spot.

3. Lock the cats in the garage (where their litter boxes, a cat tree, couch, and food/water are) overnight then leave the back door open for the dog to come and go to the yard.

Cons: I feel bad locking the cats out here as it’s nowhere near as comfy as the rest of the house. I also enjoy their presence throughout the house and don’t want to risk them starting to spend most of their time in the garage.

4. Out here in the upstairs office with a balcony and leave the door open for her to go out on the balcony to use pee pads.

Cons: she’s never pottied on the balcony and I don’t want her to learn that’s an okay spot to potty.

I really need advice and any thoughts are appreciated. She will be on Prednisone for months longer as she is very ill and we are currently on weekly vet visits. Should I ask my vet for advice?",1,1726490095.0

Which health plan should I choose: PPO or HDHP w/ HSA?,"Hi all,

Longtime lurker on a throwaway. Apologies for yet another PPO vs HDHP question, but I was hoping I could get your thoughts on which of my health insurance options would make the most sense for my situation.

I’m very lucky to have several excellent plans from my employer to choose from, but I was mainly wondering whether it would make sense to switch from my current PPO plan to the HDHP with HSA. I’m single with no dependents, so this is for employee-only coverage. Also, dental is separate, so this would be only for medical and prescription coverage. 

I’m healthy and pretty much just do preventative care + twice yearly visits to the dermatologist. I currently have two Tier 1 drug prescriptions.

I have so far gravitated towards PPOs because I enjoy the predictable and low co-pay costs for specialist visits and other services. Even though my healthcare needs are low right now, it’s comforting to know that, should that change, my out-of-pocket costs would be low. I’m afraid that if I switch to a HDHP, I might refrain from seeking medical care in order to avoid the out-of-pocket costs. I know this is a mental hangup and am willing to work on it if the consensus is that the HDHP would be more financially beneficial in the long run (and just to note, I am financially comfortable so this hangup is mainly psychological).

With all that said, here are the specifics of each plan: 

**PPO**

In-Network Deductible: $100

Out-of-Network Deductible: $600

Maximum OOP: $2,500

Premium: $15.62 biweekly

Preventative care: 100% coverage

Copays: $25 primary / $35 specialty

Outpatient MRI and CT scan: $50 copay

Urgent care (in- and out-of-network): $25 copay

Emergency care (in- and out-of-network): $100 copay, waived if admitted

Outpatient Mental Health: $25 copay

Tier 1 prescriptions: $10 copay

Tier 2 prescriptions: $30 copay

Tier 3 prescriptions: $75 copay

Maximum prescription OOP: $750



**HDHP w/ HSA ($750 annual employer contribution):**

Total in-network and out-of-network deductible: $1,650

Maximum OOP: $3,000

Premium: $31.08 biweekly

Preventative care: 100% coverage

Copays: 90% coverage after deductible

Outpatient MRI and CT scan: 90% coverage after deductible

Urgent care (in- and out-of-network): 90% coverage after deductible

Tier 1 prescriptions: covered in the HSA and at 90% in medical plan after deductible

Tier 2 prescriptions: covered in the HSA and at 90% in medical plan after deductible

Tier 3 prescriptions: covered in the HSA and at 90% in medical plan after deductible

Maximum prescription OOP: No separate out-of-pocket maximum for prescriptions

What Real Interest Rate Do You Use for Compound Interest Calculations?,"

Hello everyone,

I’m just wondering what real interest rate (right after inflation) you guys use for compound interest calculators?

I heard that if I have mostly all stocks, I should assume a 5% compounding interest for the next 30 years to be on the conservative side after taking inflation into consideration.

For context, my portfolio is:
	•	80% in VFV
	•	~10% in HXQ
	•	~10% in VDY

How does one actually get compounding interest?,"Every finance video is about investing early in a steady fixed compoundin interest investment. 

The problem is if you just buy an index fund put money in the stock market. There's no guarantee of anything actually compounding. 

Yes the S&P might have some exponential gains but it also has market crashes. But overall adjusted for inflation. It's pretty linear gain. I might be wrong on this but we're talking over dozens of years. 

The only way I found was to have a fixed rate CD, the gains are pretty modest. Modest maybe 4% but I can reinvest everything after 7 months so that compounds. And it's also a safe investment. 

What else can be a safe investment like this that has compounded interest that's consistent that I can invest in for 10 to 20 years?",0,1732296974.0
Looking for experience with Prozac,"I’m curious if anyone has experienced this while using prozac on their dog. My guy has various forms of severe anxiety. When it’s balanced, prozac works well on him. He is pretty much back to 90% his normal self. The hard part though, is keeping the drug balanced. To get him built up to that, takes a min of two months. Yes, I know that’s not the official claim. But we’ve gone though this many times now, and I’ve heard other people say the same thing… For him the loading period is at least two months, and during that time he’s massively paranoid and doesn't want to eat. If the balance could be maintained, this wouldn’t be an issue. But I’ve found the tiniest thing will screw it up. For instance, if he’s a bit runny for a few days (as dogs are once in a while), it’s like it will reset, and then he has to go through the whole big long buildup all over again. It’s very frustrating. Has anybody else experienced this with the drug? Thanks.",1,1729363506.0

Real Estate Capital Gains Cost Basis,"Lets say you inherit a house that has a reverse mortgage on it for $100k. The fair market value at the time of inheritance is 300k and you take out a mortgage for $100k to clear the reverse. After keeping the house for 5 years (as a second home) you sell the house for $500k. To keep this simple assume no selling costs and no capital improvements, also since it was a second home you can’t take the exclusion. So you have a capital gain of $500k - $300k = $200k 

My question is this does the $100k of the mortgage taken out to cover the reverse lower the gains? My first thought was no but a few things I read suggest it might, thoughts?

Complicated Home Co-owner Situation,"Ok so I was with my partner for a long time, and during Covid time we ended up moving into my moms home to pay rent there instead in a guest home she built for us to live together. The thing is, my partner had helped sign for the home since she didn't qualify on her own because of another property she owns. She would've been able to on her own only if we weren't going to move in since the amount she could've put more towards the down payment was used for the construction of our space. So his name is on there for 10% but he didn't put any down payment or contribute to anything beforehand. We moved in about 6 months after the property was purchased and started paying my mother rent. Not sure if this is important info, but any home reparirs, like a new roof, have only been funded by my mom. All my ex partner has paid for is rent. We had plans to get married but unfortunately something in his mental health declined and he is undiagnosed for whatever can cause auditory hallucinations and paranoia which in turn have made him aggressive and I ended the relationship. He's been refusing to leave on his own until his name is taken off. We've been living as roommates for over a year due to trying to figure out when we could actually apply for a quit claim. We applied a few months ago to see if my mom would qualify on her own but it was rejected and she was told if she took care of clearing/ lowering some debts it would be possible. She's done so now and got the paperwork to try again and now he refuses to sign. He's been adamant on just wanting to get his name removed and signed the first time around but it seems like due to his condition and these feelings of animosity he has, he's refusing now. Seems like lawyers are going to have to get involved. How does this look like for my mom not to get fucked in this situation and for him to just sign off to get his name off like he was adamant about the beginning and the first time around when he signed the papers that got rejected?

What to do with extra money in savings based on my current situation?,"Hello, so I've been putting off being smarter with my money for a while and I'm trying to change that.

* 30 years old
* Single
* salary: 133k/year + 8K bonus
* current savings: 35K
* I pull in some extra money with occasional contract projects, which is around 10k/year
* 401K Roth IRA is currently at 62K (upped contribution to 6% recently, company matches 5%, debating upping this)

* Own a condo (for 3 years currently)
 * 3.125% interest
 * I'm past 20% down, no PMIs
 * bought at 245k, estimates show +80-90K nowadays (not sure accuracy here but i've tracked this at the least as a relative metric over time)
 * not sure if this info is helpful but just giving some context
* Own a car with a loan, 20k left on it, upped amount I'm paying by a little bit. 

Right now my savings is just piling up on itself with little to no interest, I feel a bit lost on what the right move is here - **goal wise** I'd like to buy another condo, that is more spacious and nicer overall, I've toyed with the idea of keeping my current condo as a rental but unclear on that. So depending on this it feels like investing everything in the 401k will make this process take much longer, of seeing a return. So I was wondering what other type of investment I could look into with the other cash but I barely know where to start - index funds, high yield savings, bonds? Or if someone could point me in the right direction toward learning what makes sense, just feel like I have no mental model of what's good given my situation.

I recognize that my last paragraph has multiple branching paths but let's assume I'm just asking about the investment part for extra money in the savings.

We bought the house for 370k with 10% down at a 6.6% interest rate. Mortgage, property taxes, insurance, etc. will be around 2.8k a month. We bring home around 7k after taxes and investments each month combined. Our current savings is 90k and will be putting down half of that after closing costs.

We are currently renting a 1k sqft townhouse in a desirable city for us for 1.1k a month with like 200 in utilities monthly. I have been here 4 years and my wife 1 since she moved in after we got married. We do love the house and are excited to get into a larger space (house is 2k sqft with .4 acres of land). I just am feeling down lately with how much this is actually going to cost us long term with all the interest and everything. I have been renting since college but I think I screwed up by not coasting this for a few more yrs before buying to have a larger down payment built up. If anyone can provide their perspective on this, it would be appreciated. And to add, our salaries should go up over time but obviously don't want to factor those in right now. We both are committed to this area and our jobs for the foreseeable future. Just the amount of money going away every month vs being able to save a lot is making me queasy. My dad is saying we did not make a good financial decision for our future and thinking he may be right.",0,1732223233.0
drain savings to pay off car loan?,"I’m 21, just graduated college in May and started my job in July. I got a pretty bad deal on my car, the total was about $14.5k with a 3k down payment, but a 10.6% APR for a 72 month period. I had just gotten my license and only had about 2 years of college credit card history. I want to pay this off ASAP because of the interest. I have 6k in a HYSA that I’m thinking of putting towards the car loan. I am in a special program for work until June 2026, so I’m not as concerned about needing an emergency fund because it’s highly unlikely that I will be laid off until it ends unless I severely underperform. 

Is this a good idea? I could also just partially use it so I have a little bit to work with in case of emergency. I’m thinking of stopping my HYSA payments (have been 1.5k per month) to just speedrun the car payments but I was also looking at refinancing options. Any advice would be helpful.",0,1732309932.0

Back door Roth IRA conversion ,"Hey all just looking for clarification as this is my first time doing a back door Roth IRA conversion.

Transferred $7k (post-tax dollars) from a bank account into a traditional IRA. It earned $6.00 in the time as I was waiting to funds to become available to transfer. Looking to do a  back door Roth IRA conversion but only lets you convert the entire amount. The customer service rep told us this is considered a “taxable event” but couldn’t give any details or advice. 

Logically I’m assuming this just means I am  taxed on the $6 and not on the other $7k since that was already taxed. Am I looking at that correctly? Just making sure before I do the conversion. ",0,1731702665.0

Breed Recommendations - Single Household ,"**Introduction**

1.      **Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
I’ve had family dogs growing up these have been bichon mixes. I’ve taken care of friend’s dogs standard poodles, setters, mixed breeds but not taken a sole ownership role.

**2.     Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a** [**reputable breeder**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**?**  
No preference currently, I’d prefer to go for a non-mixed breed to have a better general idea of the dogs tendencies though I know every dog is an individual and can vary from breed standards.

**3.     Describe your ideal dog.**  
A friendly and playful dog good with other dogs of varying sizes and not super independent. I prefer them to look at me for guidance but be comfortable around other people.

**4.     What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
My favorite dog breed is the wirehaired pointing griffon, though they are high energy and I am nervous about not being able to keep up with them. I like their personality, size and coat type. Bench labs have interested me as well, but the shedding has put me off.

**5.     What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
Basic obedience, sit, stay, place, lay down, break. Maybe some tricks but I’m more interested in training related to keeping good manners and them safe while maneuvering in a public space.

**6.     Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
No

**Care Commitments**

7) **How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
The office I work at is dog friendly so they would be with me all day, short breaks to play, training sessions, and walks are acceptable and encouraged where I work.

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**  
I anticipate 30 min exercise in the morning two 20 min walks throughout the day, a half hour to an hour in the evening. These can and would mostly all be a bit longer on weekends.  
  


9) **How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
I’m open to doing what is necessary for the animal, paying a groomer is not an issue and learning to do some things on my own such as nails, ears etc. is totally fine

**Personal Preferences**

10) **What size dog are you looking for?**  
I’d prefer a medium to large-ish size dog, A lab/Golden would be the larger size.

11) **How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
I’d prefer lower shedding, less of a tendency to bark, and as little slobber as possible

12) **How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
Not very important, though something like a grey hound never being safe off leash would make me nervous if they ever somehow got out.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) **Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
A Velcro dog would be great

14) **Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**  
Closer to the eager-to-please

15) **How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**  
I would want to dog to greet them happily or with a polite aloofness. Often times at work I have people stop by my office so they would need to be tolerant of other people entering “Their space”

16) **Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
I do not want a dog that has tendencies towards dog aggression.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  
Tendencies towards anxiousness are probably something I’d prefer to avoid, though I know some dogs are more confident than others.

**Lifestyle**

18) **How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
Not often and likely for a few hours at most such as trips to stores that don’t allow animals or during a work event.

19) **What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**  
No other preferences

20) **Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**  
I have reptile and fish which would never interact with the dog. My coworkers have various dog breeds ranging from Chihuahua to Irish wolfhound so the dog should at least be okay around other dogs. (My office door closes so the animals aren’t just free roaming and they would have opportunities to take breaks away from other animals.

21) **Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
I have a young nephew who would occasionally be around the dog and sometimes kids come into the office. They would never be around the dog unsupervised and my nephew is dog savvy.

22) **Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
It’s a rental with no restrictions. It’s a small cottage with a large yard.

23) **What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
Cape Cod Massachusetts, my town has no breed restrictions.

24) **What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
It’s hot and humid in the summer and cold and snowy in the winter.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) **Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant**.  
The town I work in is VERY dog friendly so they would go with me most places, I have a truck and would like the animal to be able to hop in so a giant dog wouldn’t work for me helping them get in or out if needed and I’d prefer to not have a tiny dog.  
  
I also like to swim and have many places the dog could join such as a pond, beach, and pool so a water loving dog would be nice.",1,1729536382.0

Trying to pay off debt but also save for car down payment,"Hi all! I’ve recently been trying to get a better grip on my finances. My take home pay from my main job is $3,010/month. After all my expenses (bills, student loan minimums, etc.) I’m usually left with about $400 leftover. In my savings I have $11,400 for an emergency fund (trying to get it up to an even $12k) but where I’m struggling is where to put the $400. 

I have about $33k in student loans (down from $56k.)

I also would like to start contributing to sinking funds such as: car maintenance, medical bills, gifts and annual expenses. In my account currently those buckets are empty. 

I will need to buy a car within the next year or two. I’m currently leasing a car (I know I know not the best decision but I can’t change that now.) and the lease ends sept 2025. I am planning to buy it out (or try to extend my lease for another year to save more for the down payment. Any thoughts on that are also welcome.) I think having $5k to put down would be a real win! But not super attainable unless I don’t contribute to the other areas and also try to extend the lease. 

I think part of the problem is mental. $400 just doesn’t seem like a lot when I have to split it up between so many areas so I struggle with divvying the money into a few buckets but putting more in or spreading it out more but putting less in each. 

Additionally, I petsit/dog walk on the side. This money varies greatly as it can sometimes be $200 and sometimes $1000 depending on how many gigs I get. It is great to have extra cash though and it’s what’s helped me grow my EF. I don’t count it as part of my income when budgeting though because I don’t want to accidentally spend it. It all currently goes into the EF. and eventually into a sinking fund or toward loans. 


Overall I know I’m improving because I used to overspend every month and even just having anything to put toward saving is a win but I’m just feeling overwhelmed with my goals and how to get there. TIA!!",0,1732477076.0
Behavior problems with Caucasian Shepherd,"Hi everyone, 
My sister has a Caucasian shepherd mix (not sure what other breed he’s mixed with though) with huge behavioral issues. 
He’s doesn’t listen and has been very hard to train, and is getting more and more aggressive when you try to correct him : growling and outright biting.
He’s almost two, and she castrated him recently, which didn’t help with that particular issue. 
He’s a lovely dog, playful, affectionate, protector, smart but we’d love tips on how to correct those behaviors. 
Because of the lack of obedience and reactivity, he almost never goes out on walks and doesn’t have a lot of space to run around and burn energy. She has two other dogs but they don’t get along great with him, which might contribute negatively as well. 
She is an experienced dog owner and has previous experience with that breed and giant breeds (Great Dane, Boerboel) which all went well, but she’s a bit out of her depth here. 
Would really appreciate any advice and insights 🙏 thank you so much ! ",1,1730296559.0
Should I do backdoor Roth?,"Hi Everyone! 33 M here, married, no kids. We always file jointly. Earlier this year, I did lump sum in to Roth in January but now will end up making between 250-260k (fortunately).

I am in the process of re-characterizing my contributions as Trad IRA contributions. I am not yet eligible for 401k at my job but will be starting Jan 1st, 2025 and with my spouse going back to workforce next year, we will not be eligible for Roth IRA and our Trad IRA contributions will be non-deductible.

My question is, should I maintain my contributions as Trad IRA and take the tax deduction this year or should I do backdoor Roth since all of my IRA so far is Roth and that next year I will have to do backdoor Roth anyways?

Other relevant information:

- No mortgage, we rent
- No car note, will have one starting summer next year
- Student loans totaling 500k between both of us but currently no minimum payments required

I would appreciate any and all the inputs. Thank you for your time and happy Thanksgiving!

How would workers comp Settlement affect my parents government help?,"After 5 long years my dad's workers comp case finally ended. And after budgeting for some urgent house repairs there's about $100k my parents will have left form the settlement.

We are really good at living below our means and budgeting (never had to use loans or go into debt) but this is in part thanks to us utilizing government programs. We all have Medicaid and my parent use food stamps and are also are part of a energy program that helps them out with gas and electricity bills.

I'm concerned for my parents future and was talking with them about investing those $100k. They might not live a life of luxury but I want them to at least be able to live day to day without worrying to much about money once they get older.

Their main concern about investing this money is how it would affect their eligibility for the previously mentioned government programs and stuff like disability. Would they lose these benefits? They can't afford to pay for insurance and if they lost all the other help then those 100k would disappear into nothing.

Also Is there any stuff I can read up on that would help me better understand my parents situation and see what their best options are? (Already been reading through the wiki, which has been incredibly helpful)

Additional info: We live in Illinois in case that would affect anything.

Thank you in advance

"Puppy blues, specifically potty training ","So I have a lovely, sweet as anything, 8 month old Black Lab/Great Dane mix, foster failed her about a month ago. She was a farm dog before that, and potty training has been...trying. After her initial few days settling in we started in on establishing a routine, effusive praise and treats when she was peeing outside, setting up a doorbell for her to associate with pee time, and I think we were 90% there (with peeing anyway, poop was about 50-50). She was asking to go out reliably, had a designated pee spot in the backyard, accidents inside were totally understandable for a puppy but trending downward.

We had one day of heavy rain where she was too scared to go outside at all, and it's all gone back to zero. I understand potty training is a series of progression and regression, but she's absolutely refusing to eliminate outside at all; not on walks, not in the yard, not when our other dogs go. This morning I was cleaning up her poop in the hallway which woke me up, so I let her out...and while I was cleaning she snuck up behind me and peed on the floor. When I finished doing that and took everything outside, she pooped inside again. It's baffling, and frustrating, and I can't stop feeling like I'm failing her somehow.

We've tried taking her out at thirty minute intervals, giving her baths to get her used to water (which is odd because she loves water and played in the rain before), like I said the training was going well, I've tried timing her from drinking water to peeing and scheduling going outside around that... I'm just out of ideas, and 6-10 accidents inside a day isn't sustainable and I'm sure causing actual issues in her development. The group we adopted her from has a trainer, and when I asked her, she just shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't know either.

Any ideas are greatly appreciated, she's extremely sensitive and become a bonded pair with my other youngest dog (2 ish year old Staffy).",1,1731506792.0

About my dogs behaviour,"Hello people of reddit, I 23F have a male golden retriever that is going to turn 5 very soon. He is a sweetheart and can be stubborn at times, but the reason I am creating this post is to ask some questions about some of his behaviours which I would like to be explained.
1. Sometimes he will raise his upper lip, maybe both or just one side, like once I was playing with him asking loudly where he was and he had his lip up, I don't know if this expression is because he is confused or amused by a game he doesn't understand
2. So, he is very possessive of his toys, when he is laying down on the bed or other things, if I kiss him he will lightly growl, the strange this is, if I leave him alone he will look behind is back as if he didn't expect, I know he doesn't do it to threat me, I just wonder why

Other party (seller) probably wants me to take care of the loc, but my credit has come collections accounts because of the mistakes I made in my early 20s. 

Now, the other party doesn't know that, will I still be able to buy this company and loc will get tranfer onto me or will this be problem. Banks might hesitate to transfer the Loc on my name.

Prudential Long Term Care Bond,"Hello,  
  
I’m keen to hear if anyone has experience with, or knowledge about, Prudential's Long Term Care Bond. This product was originally purchased by my grandparents in 1997 under its former name, the Scottish Amicable Long Term Care Bond.

In 2020 we completed the sale of my grandparents’ home after my grandfather passed away and my grandmother moved into a care home. It seems that both of them held policies, but the capital amount was significantly lower than the £20,000 each had invested in 1997.

Given the product’s name, I had assumed it was designed to help cover care home fees if one spouse entered care after the other passed away. This is precisely the situation we are now facing. However, we haven’t had any communication from Prudential in the past four years. We also haven’t received any statements, details of key benefits, or other relevant updates regarding the product.  


The original documentation we have indicates some sort of £20,000 per annum payout, but it does not clarify under what circumstances or when this would be claimable.

There are a few articles online, whereby people had issues in receiving the investment value: See Guardian Article, from 2007 titled: Long-term care bond victory.

It would appear that 'Pru Intl review shuts LTC bond' in 2003.

If anyone has insights or additional information about this bond, I would greatly appreciate your input.

Rental application income questions ,"Hey all! I’m filling out apartment and credit applications for the first time in a couple years, and I have a question on income:

I know it’s preferable to use gross income, but as I am in the union there are two numbers I can use. My taxable income is around $150-$160,000 per year, but my total package when health trust, pensions, 401K etc are included is closer to $220,000. 

Am I allowed to put down my “total package” as my income amount? My pay stubs only show my taxable total, but I have paperwork which shows my total package/adjusted hourly rate, so I’m curious if that would be considered unprovable income or if I can count it.

Credit card is giving me balance transfer offer. What’s the best way to maximize it?,"I have a card thru one of the large banks. For one of the cards, they’re giving me either a 9 month at 0% apy or 15 months at 0.99% apy. Total amount is $9500  

What would you recommend I do with this offer? 

The balance transfer would incur a 3% BT fee so for 9 months, I’d have to net more than $285. 

For the 15 months, the 0.99% apy would incur a total interest of $118. So my total return would have to be greater than ~$405.  

I could keep it in my HYSA but I’m not sure the 4%+ will last for the duration (plus taxes would might just make me breakeven with the BT fee).

"Help recommend me an active, big-feeling small dog breed?","    **Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * This will be my first dog as an adult. I was heavily involved with training my family's golden retrievers as a teen--I took them to agility classes and we went hiking daily. I also grew up on/around farms and have a lot of cow and horse experience. Obviously that's not the same thing, but there are some transferrable animal skills.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * I am open to either.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * I want an active, social dog who can keep up with a physically vigorous lifestyle (hiking, ideally running) and is less than 20lbs.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * Honestly, I'm really sad about the 20lbs thing! It's a lease requirement. I love the golden retrievers I grew up with. I also love the sound of English Cocker Spaniels, but they're still too big. 
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * I have no specific training goals beyond wanting a dog who can be involved in as much of my life as possible.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * I don't specifically want to do a dog sport, but I have agility experience and would do it again.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * A few hours? I could be flexible about this.
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * My partner and I both run, and I would love to bring a dog on my runs around the nearby nature preserve. Of course I would walk a dog who couldn't keep up with running! In addition: the nature preserve has a dog pond for swimming; I hike on the weekends; we have a small fenced yard. I am really active and could give a dog potentially hours of exercise/day.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * I'm open to any grooming requirements.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Under 20lbs :(
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * Minimal barking, because of the apartment. Shedding and slobber are fine.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * Not very.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * More snuggly than not, but this isn't super important to me.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * Eager-to-please
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * I need a dog that can at least tolerate strangers. Liking strangers is even better.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * This is not my preference.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * Just aggresion and barking.
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * Minimally--0 hours/day on average, up to 4 hours/day max.
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * My partner will be invovled with caring for the dog. We have similar preferences.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * No other pets
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * No children
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * I rent, 20lb weight restriction.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * Cambridge MA; no laws.
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * It's warmer every year, but in general MA has warm/hot summers (85 degrees) and cold winters (below freezing).
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    * No additional information.
    
    26) Feel free to ask any questions below.
    
    * I have already done so much googling, and I don't know that there's a ""perfect"" small dog breed for me. I would love to hear from people who love their small dogs--convince me that this will be ok! ",1,1731371894.0

Wondering if I should sell my home when we move or rent it out,"We are located in south Texas, and looking to relocate up north.

I owe 178,000 on my house and have at least $100,000 of equity in it. My mortgage is $1800 and I could rent it out in my area likely for about $2700.

Considering the cost for a Property Manager and other maintenance, I might make about $500 a month renting out my house. 

However, if we sell it, we can take that equity and use it toward another house or have a sizable emergency fund / extra money for investing.

"How do I as a US/CAD PR living here, best empty an inherited IRA by 2032?","I am meeting with my wife's Canadian investment advisor and my Canadian x-border preparer, but have seen some great advice come from this group that may help me know what questions to ask. Here's the situation:

US citizen, early 60s, married and living with my Canadian wife as a PR for almost three years. Unable (unwanting) to work for a year until my PR status arrived, slowed by Covid. Mother died in 2022 leaving me about $350K US in an iIRA. Recent IRS rules give me a 10yr window to use the money. Now make over $200K CAD/yr at a corporate communications job so between the exchange rate and tax rate, I'm seeing a lot of this money potentially going away if I use it unwisely. My US advisor (basically my mother's former guy) who manages the iIRA is a little lost about what my Canadian status will have on the funds, so I find myself in a bit of a cross border quandry.

I had a healthy freelance video, design and film composition side business in the US and I'd love to use that money to transition from a corporate gig to a retirement gig that I thoroughly enjoy. Between my wife and I, we have enough but feel like a few more years of prudent earning/investing would position us for a comfortable post-9/5 life.

Happy to be out and active (they love the water—swimming, boating, they scuba dive, they bike, and they always love a walk) but also happy to laze at home
Eager to learn and follow through
They are happy to put in work training but do not want to do any kind of intense/militant obedience/task training

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

They like golden retrievers and Bernese, but are aware they’re “heartbreak breeds”—our family grew up with goldens and we’ve known many Bernese throughout our life as well. They also like Newfies and Akbash. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic manners and every day things (sit, stay, recall, leave it, etc)

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No sport or work, just daily activities with them. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Her partner will be retired so he will be with the pup all day, and she will be working on location some days and at home some days, so they will be wanting to spend as much time as possible with the pup. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

At least a couple hours every day, but not sure about dog parks. They want to do trails and hiking, where they will still meet other dogs, in addition to regular walks. They also love the water so will be at the beaches and lakes regularly. Maybe cycling, as well. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Yes to both, she loved brushing our dogs but also took them to the groomers. Regular brushing is no problem. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium-large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding is not a problem. Controlled barking is ok but does not want a breed that will be wanting to bark 24/7. Slobber, minimal though will be in a house with hardwood floors so clean up isn’t an issue. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It would be ideal to be able to have the pup off leash in off-leash/leash-optional areas. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly, or equally snuggly and happy to have its own space. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Definitely would like the pup to alert to knocking or someone/something in the yard but not excessive. Friendly to strangers or visitors. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

If the pup ends up being reactive or aggressive of course they’d manage it. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

High anxiety/destructive. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not long as her partner will be retired and she will be home often as well. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

It will be just my mother and her partner and they will be caring for the dog quite equally. Their preferences are quite similar. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Eventually planning on a second dog, but will obviously be starting with one. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No, it would just be if they were to encounter children while out and about.

Vancouver Island, Canada. Not aware of any specific breed bans.

Should We Invest or Pay Off Debt?,"
Me and my fiancée are getting married soon and we want to make better financial choices for ourselves. In my culture people gift money for the wedding. So me and my husband are worried about not knowing how to manage the money correctly. I am in around $7k in credit card debt right now, i was in $10k but i managed to pay $3k for the year. I also closed all my credit cards and i am paying $200 for 5 years to pay off my debt. My husband is in the same amount of debt as me. Our credit card interests varies but they’re all higher than 20%. We also have student loans. We are planning to move in with my parents after me graduating so I can find a job and also save money. My husband will be in college still. We are expecting around $5k from the wedding and we are not sure if we should invest the money but we don’t even know what to invest the money with or just use it to pay off debts. We are just scared of not handling the money correctly ",0,1732205941.0
Starting over after divorce ,"Hi! I’m 37f, divorced mother of 1 (11) trying to figure out how to plan for the future. I was a SAHM for 9 years while married and I’ve been busting my ass starting over for the last 2 years. Ex bought me out of the mortgage and with that money I paid off my car and lived off the rest while paying for school and life expenses. Got a degree, got a job, and now I feel like I’m finally on level ground but I’m also feeling increasingly overwhelmed in a whole new way.



Here is where I am at currently: 

Take home into my checking account is 4400/month. 

I put 5% into a Roth 401k and 5% into a Traditional 401k (and get a 5% employer match in the traditional), plus I’ve started putting 15% into a HYSA that is my emergency fund. These all get deducted from my check respectively and are already factored out of the amount above. 

The only debt I have is 4.5k remaining from a medical procedure that’s on a credit card since I went a year without insurance 🫠 oops 

Monthly expenses are only about 3k (rent, utilities, food, gas, etc) but my ex is out of work so I’ve been shouldering a lot more of our kiddos needs, so recently closer to 3.2-3.5k. Still a bit of room left to save though, and I’m willing to go more lean if it means padding for the future.



These are my questions: 

\- Should I continue to split between a Roth and Trad 401k? In my mind Roth is a better choice but I’m not confident on if that’s actually true which is why I split them. 

\- Should I use my HYSA to pay off the debt then rebuild that emergency fund? I only have 7500 in the HYSA. 

\- Should I switch to 10% into a HYSA and max out a Roth IRA? Or add an HSA?



Short term goal is to buy a house in 2025, credit score is 812, but I’m mostly worried about my low income holding me back on this. So it might not be possible, I might need to wait until I break six figures if I’m being honest with myself. 

Long term the dream is ‘retire’ by 55, but this is wholly dependent on maximizing my earnings potential while saving simultaneously, and is less than 20 years away…

I want to set myself up for success and I feel like my goals are really aggressive, but I’m starting really late and have this crushing sense that I need to catch up. Any thoughts, input, advice, etc is most appreciated!!",0,1732157361.0
"Pay off student loans, or get a new car?","Hello all, I have approximately $22,000 in student loan debt. My grandparents have recently come into a sizable amount of money, and wanted to help buy me a new vehicle. The one I currently have is mostly fine though getting to be older (2014 model with ~124k miles), would get a decent bit on trade in value, so I’d be able to make a significant upgrade. The amount they’re willing to help me with would almost completely pay off my loans. Right now my loan payments are a pain, although manageable, and I even ran it by them if they’d be willing to purpose the money towards that rather than getting a new vehicle and they said that would be fine too. 

So my question is, should I take the opportunity to get a brand new, fully paid off vehicle while I have the chance, or should I go ahead and pay off my loans? It would put my wife and I almost entirely debt free aside from the little bit I’d still have on my loans, and the payments we make monthly on my wife’s car. 

Any input is welcome, and I can add a bit more context if needed. ",0,1732470524.0

* fiancé and I are 27 have been together for 8 years. We both always wanted a dog and waited for the right time. We are financially stable (even if we would need thousands for health reasons or would need to move,..), we planned for healthinsurance, dog tax, food,.. for every month and emergencies. 
We know that a dog is a huge responsibility, that’s why we waited that long. We don’t want kids, our jobs and our apartment are secure. We have a lot of family members that offered to watch the dog if we aren’t able to (some of them had/ have dogs so they have the experience). I watched dogs as a teenager and am currently reading books about training. We would go to a doggy school and to a trainer. In germany the term “ESA dog” is not protected under the law so they don’t have more rights than a “normal pet”. 

I got sick 4 years ago and had to stop working last year. My doctors think that I can get healthy again but don’t know when. We are still financially stable, have enough time and energy to care for a dog. The ESA dog would be for me. But if I get healthy again I would take the dog with me to the kids (teach chronically sick children at their home).

He's still full of love, and not really sure what the best thing to do is. I raised him since he was just a few months, and it's really a hard call. Mentally, he is still there, and the way he looks at me and my son and gives us kisses makes the decision to let him go that much harder.

\* Currently mostly looking at the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever and Border Collie. The Small Münsterlander and Dalmatian have also crossed my mind, I worry the winters here are too cold for Dalmatians though.

5)    What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* I want it to have a great recall. General commands to dictate its movement during snowboarding would be nice. Otherwise just standard commands to make it more pleasant around the apartment.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* Not counting walks up to an hour on workdays, more on weekends.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

\* 1-2 hours, more on weekends. 

Within 10 minutes of walking I can be in the hills, so lots of hikes. Swimming. Maybe running/mountainbiking. Snowboarding.

9)    How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* Once or twice a week. Would be willing to pay a professional, but intending to do it all myself.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)    What size dog are you looking for?

\* Prefer medium, could be large.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* Preferably not much slobber, and not too much barking either, being in an apartment and all.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Important, would like the dog to be off-leash when allowed on hikes and during snowboarding.

There’s reindeer walking loose all summer, even in town, so a strong herding instinct might not be ideal.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Either or. Would need to be somewhat independent though.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* So long as it’ll have a perfect recall. Would want the dog to be independent.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* Would want the dog to be mostly indifferent.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* Will want it to be good around other dogs, can be mostly indifferent, but not aggressive.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Definitely want to avoid separation anxiety.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* Minimum of 5 days a week for 8/9 hours straight. As soon as the dog is a bit older around 2 evenings a week and some hours during the weekend occasionally.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

\* Not relevant.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* No

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* I rent, no current restrictions. Small apartment so medium dog is preferable over a large one.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* Norway. Unaware.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summer averages 15 degrees Celsius. Winter averages -10 degrees Celsius(14 Fahrenheit).

Can Klarna + Credit Card Really Delay Payments for 2 Months Interest-Free,"
I’m about to start using Klarna, and I’ve been wondering about something. If I use a credit card as my payment method with Klarna, does that mean I can effectively delay my payment by up to two months?

Here’s my thought process: Klarna lets me pay 30 days after the purchase, and credit card payments are typically charged at the end of the billing cycle. So, if I use my AMEX credit card to pay Klarna at the end of their 30-day period, wouldn’t that give me another month (until my credit card bill is due) before I actually have to pay? Would this essentially let me delay my payment interest-free for two months?",0,1732467226.0

Considering paying off my auto loan in full,"I've got a 33k auto loan at 13.9% which is recently eligible for a refi. The refi is pre-approved at 8.5% but I was told that is an estimate so not a guaranteed final amount. I have .7 BTC and in this run up I'm considering liquidating half of that to just pay the truck off. I don't know how to gauge the wisdom of this, aside from less debt is a good thing in most cases.

In other news I am contributing the max amount to a 401k and have 0 in savings while I work to pay down a credit card debt of (now) 20k that I accumulated during Covid. 7k of that debt is balance transferred to an 18 month interest free card. I pay rent and otherwise have normal bills.

In the past couple of years I have been diligent about not accumulating more debt and living within my means, paying for everything with my debit card and I'm very proud of myself on that front. However I feel overwhelmed when looking at the big picture. My goal is to be debt free ASAP and build up an emergency savings fund while still funding my retirement.

Do I need a financial advisor? ,"-Inherited approx 125k 

I’m not financially savvy. I’m good at saving and paying my bills. Never had an upbringing that taught me about investing nor have I educated myself on it. My parents were convinced into buying a whole life insurance policy in which they convinced me so that will give you and idea about my knowledge of financial instruments. I bought it at age 23 and now at 39 the cash value is a little north of 40k. I plan on cashing it out and adding it to the 125k as advised by an advisor.  

-I make 100k, my wife about 60k
-I have a mortgage, about 240k left on it. 4% interest rate, bought in 2015
-we have a 4 year old
-one car payment, my wife some student loans 
-I’m a blue collar worker- I get a pension at the end. No 401k, no IRA. 

My grandmother passed away and left me 125k. She had lived her last 50 years off of her brokerage account. My inclination is to just take the money and start my own brokerage account and IRA and let it grow. She had and advisor manage her account, which was much larger than what I received from her. The management company that handled her account is happy to open one for me. She trusted them and was with them for decades. Since I don’t know much, would it be better for them to just manage it for me? Should I just take the money and open my own vanguard or Schwab? I’m assuming the fees would be similar.

My dog initiated a fight with our new cat. ,"We recently got a new cat, kitten is likely the proper term because he is definitely still a baby. 

We’ve had Baxter our pittie mix for nearly a year now. He’s always been nice around our toddlers, other animals, and even extremely gentle with our 2 month old baby. 

He’s never shown any signs of aggression. Like stated above he even lets our toddlers pull on him and push him around.  

He’s crate trained and lays in there when he wants to be alone. 

Today I watched as our kitten pawed at him when Baxter was in his crate. He paid the cat no mind. Even when the cat jumped up on top of his crate and tried to paw at him again Baxter just laid there. 

Jump to tonight. I had just taken Baxter outside for his nighttime potty. We were sitting in the living room and instead of going back to his crate he walked right over to the cat and lunged. 

No signs of aggression before, no snarling, no growling. But it clearly wasn’t okay. I’m at a loss. No one was hurt because I got in the middle and diffused the situation. But God forbid one of the toddlers be in the middle of that.

Surrendering,"I’m absolutely heartbroken, I’ve never had to surrender an animal. I genuinely don’t know how to live with it, I feel so much guilt and sadness. I lost both two fur babies within a couple years of one another. I found my dog hours after having a massive stroke. It’s was genuinely incredibly traumatic. 

Eventually after moving to Texas , I decided it was the right time to rescue again. I fell in love with this sweet boxer mix, we named her Ivy. Ivy has always had quite the personality. Right off the bat she displayed issues with resource guarding. We didn’t think it wasn’t something we could help her work through. We brought in trainer into the home, it really seemed to be improving. 

Fast forward, we decided to get her a companion after the 18 months of having her. We brought home a puppy to raise aside her and initially things were great. They made good friends. 

All of a sudden they kept getting into fights, I can’t tell you how many bites and bruise’s I’ve obtained trying to break them up. Ivy’s aggression started making its appearance full force and it wasn’t just at other dogs, but both my boyfriend and I as well. She got very comfortable growling, baring her teeth, snapping and snarling at us. She nips but has never seriously injured anyone. 

One minute she’s the sweetest dog melting in your lap, the next she’s terrifying. It’s unbelievable that this is the same dog. I’ve been so desperate to help her and make this work. She has had so many chances. It’s been going on for more than a year. We have tried everything From an in-home trainer, to vet visits,separation, structure, mussel training, extra exercise, 101 attention, separate beds and anxiety medication. 

It’s constant and unpredictable. It’s over food, toys, attention, territory, grooming and even eye contact. I can’t even pet her at this point without getting grasped at or nipped. 

My boyfriend has been at the end of his rope for awhile, begging me to call it. He’s been very patience with my stubborn desperation to help her. I’m the last person to surrender an animal, feels unforgivable. I’m certain they won’t rehome her again. The fact that this feels like a matter of life and death makes it so much harder. However I recognize her quality of life isn’t what it should be and that’s devastating. I just want her to be at ease, I love her inexplicably. 

I was petting her in bed today and all of a sudden not only nipped at me but then aggressively jumped on top of my. It really scared me. I feel like I’ve completely lost the dog I brought home, she’s just mean all the time now and none of my effort or money is fixing anything. I’m worn out and I’m scared, I feel like I’m being held hostage because the idea of her being put down absolutely kills me. 

I know I might get some backlash for not doing this sooner but I just really wanted to help her. I don’t think I can do this anymore and it’s absolutely going to devastate me. I don’t know how I’ll be able to forgive myself. ",1,1728290752.0

Can I train my dog to like soft toys without ripping them apart?,"I have the sweetest 5 y/o Newfie with quite a few quirks. He's not huge on toys, but that's partially because I can't give him anything soft or he'll rip it apart, lol. He loves playing ball with rubber balls, and he takes good care of those (even the squeaky ones), but anything soft, he immediately lays down with it and begins systematically ripping it apart. It's something he thoroughly enjoys doing, so every once in a while I give him a soft tennis ball or something and just let him go at it. Thankfully he doesn't eat the pieces.

When he was a puppy, I got him all kinds of cute, fluffy animal toys, and he always shredded them, but I guess I just thought that was normal puppy behavior (and it was great to divert him from chewing my rugs and furniture). However I guess that taste for ripping cute little fake animals apart came with him into adulthood. What's funny is that he is more gentle than any dog I've ever met with other animals of all sizes and kinds. He loves squirrels and bunnies but I swear if he actually reached one, he would just sniff it and want to play. He LOVES my 5-lb cat even though she despises him and punches him in the face daily. So it's definitely not a prey drive thing, I don't think?

Like I said, he's 5. I definitely don't want to cause any distress or anything. But is this something I could train him out of? He's very food motivated (more than toys) so there's that. I just would love to be able to give him a few cute fluffy toys that he takes good care of, and chew on without actually tearing apart.",1,1732039346.0

Managing a puppy whilst working from home,"I hope to one day add another dog to our household, specifically a working line golden retriever puppy from an ethical and responsible breeder. I have found a breeder that I’m really impressed with which ticks all the boxes. 

I recently started a new role where I can now work from home 4 days a week with one day in the office. I’ve loving the hybrid role. 

I guess my question is, for those of you that work from home or hybrid work, how did you manage a puppy and work? How did you avoid separation anxiety? I want to have a healthy balance of meeting the puppy’s needs and not impacting my work. 

Some background. I have a show line golden retriever now who will be 9 in December. My partner also works from home full time. I have experience of raising my current dog from a puppy. She did puppy, bronze, silver and gold Kennel Club Good Citizen Scheme, she’s done agility and I am an accredited agility instructor. My parents live nearby who are happy to help with support and care if needed. 

I won’t get another puppy/dog if it’s not right for my situation. I will only get another if the time is right. 

Part of finding out if the time is right is making a good assessment of how to realistically manage working full time from home and raising a puppy at the same time which I appreciate will bring additional stress, time and commitment. I plan on taking a couple of weeks off work when I first bring the puppy home to help with settling them into a routine and building trust. 

I have researched some local gundog trainers, obedience and foundation agility skills trainers (once pup is old enough for flatwork at 6 months) near me that I hope to take a puppy to. 

Can you give me your thoughts, advice, or tips and tricks for a smooth transition. How did you manage. Any problems you came across that you didn’t account for and how did you resolve it? Is there anything I should consider etc. ",1,1726767264.0
Profit sharing percentage into 401k?,"I guess this is more of a tax implication question. My wife and I both make comparable salaries and we each contribute the maximum per year into our 401k's and we usually max out around October. We also usually each get profit sharing from our respective companies each year. The profit sharing in most instances is close to the maximum amount that can be contributed annually to a 401k. So my question is, is there any advantage to contributing 100% of our profit sharing to our 401k which would max us out earlier in the year so the remainder of paychecks would be higher each week.  I thought I remembered hearing that taxes were higher on profit sharing/bonuses as compared to the taxes on your salary. Just wondering if there is any benefit to doing this?",0,1732422731.0
Is my employers 401k match as bad as I think it is?,"So I work for the State of Maryland. We pay 7% into our pension fund and then we also have an employer 401k. I have read online that most employer sponsored 401k plans match up to 5% of the employee contributions. Well the state of Maryland will only match dollar per dollar the first 600 bucks and that's it and they only started doing that again in 2023 after I think 20 years. (Iffy on that because I can only find an article from 2003 stating they got rid of it. Also it looks like the 600 dollar figure is the same as when it first started in the late 1990s. 

Is my uneducated hunch correct or am I wrong in my assumption? I realize I don't really have any other choice except changing employers but hey I guess we get really good health insurance for cheap haha. ",0,1732165970.0

[Advice Needed] Struggling with Leash Training Our New Rescue,"Hey everyone,

My fiancée and I recently rescued a 1-year-old Japanese Spitz, whom we’ll call “Spot,” about four weeks ago. She’s a 25-pound bundle of energy who came all the way from South Korea, where she spent a large portion of her life in a cage. Adjusting to life in NYC (specifically Brooklyn) has been an interesting journey for all of us!

The Good Stuff:
Spot’s been amazing in many ways. She’s surprisingly chill with the usual city chaos – sirens, trucks, people, you name it. She’s also okay being left alone for a few hours without any major issues, and we’ve only had a few minor potty training hiccups indoors.

The Challenge:
The biggest problem we’re facing is leash training. Spot’s foster family admitted she didn’t receive any formal training and was allowed to pull and sniff as she pleased. Since adopting her, we’ve watched a ton of YouTube videos, and we even brought in a professional trainer who we meet once every two weeks, who suggested a pinch/prong collar. The trainer spent a couple of hours with us to make sure we’re using it properly and even provided us with personalized videos for extra guidance.

While the collar has definitely made walks more manageable, she still doesn’t really focus on me when we’re walking, even though I’m offering treats and using a clicker to reinforce good behavior. It feels like I’m correcting her every few steps, and at this point, it’s been two weeks with minimal improvement – if anything, it seems like she’s starting to ignore the collar entirely.

Our Question:
For those of you who’ve had success with leash training rescues, especially dogs who might not have had any early guidance, how long did it take for things to “click”? Did you find certain techniques worked better over time? I’m trying to stay patient and consistent, but any advice or personal experiences would be super helpful!

Thanks in advance!",1,1730336362.0

Open enrollment has begun at work. Questions about retirement and HSA specifically.,"My work has open enrollment for 2025 benefits now. I'm staff at a public community college, so we get health insurance, a 457, 401k, an HSA, and a pension. Trying to figure out what's best for me--I'm 27, single, and only intend to stay here another 2 years maximum.

**General info:**

* I make $22.04 an hour pre-tax and work 40 hours per week. We are paid bi-weekly, so 26 paychecks a year. My pre-tax paychecks are $1,763.20. Post-tax I get $1,170.17. Rent is $615 and utilities are $120.
* Federal and state income tax is about $300, union dues are about $37, my health insurance is about $78 (premium + HSA contribution), 457 contribution is about $70, and my pension contribution is about $110. 

**Health insurance:**

* The premium (once per paycheck, paid bi-weekly) for 2024 was $15, and it's $33 for 2025. Not a huge jump, but still. The deductible is now $1,650, co-insurance is $650, and the maximum out of pocket is $2,300.
* My employer contributes $825 to my HSA, which leaves me with $3,475 left to contribute in the year. Divided per paycheck, that's about $133.65 per paycheck. This is a lot. I'm currently contributing $63--this will get me just past the maximum out of pocket by the end of the year. I felt it was the safest minimum amount to contribute.

**Retirement:**

* I have a 457 that I contribute to (always 100% vested) and a 401k that my employer contributes to. The sheet shows a 2% contribution by me for savings, and a 1% match by my employer; then a 2% contribution by me for PHF, and a 2% match by my employer. I don't fully understand the division since the 457 and 401k are not divided into savings and private health fund.
   * I'm currently contributing 4% to my 457 assuming I receive a 3% match from my employer.
* I also contribute 6.2% for my pension with a 6.2% employer match.

**Other:**

* I also have a Roth IRA and HYSA that I contribute to when I can, even if it's just a tiny bit. Usually, I dump as much as I can into the Roth from my savings at the beginning of the year, and then just contribute to my savings as the year goes on.

**Questions:**

* Should I prioritize maximizing my HSA contributions? I've heard this is the best thing to do before contributing to a Roth IRA, but I don't make a ton of money as-is.
* Which retirement elections should I prioritize? I've heard HSA, then 401k/457, then Roth IRA. Just want to make sure that tends to be correct.
* If I leave this job, will my HSA go with me or will I be forced to transfer it to my 457 or forfeit/withdraw it and take the penalty? I suspect this is a question for the bank that holds my HSA, just wondering if there's a standard practice.",0,1732041836.0

personal loan question,"While digging out of an unemployment drought (I'm employed now, but being paid much less), I racked up some credit card debt. I have around $6,000 of it and I'm wondering is a personal loan would be a good option?

my dog passed and i miss him dearly ,i don’t know what to say or how to word it. but yesterday my dog passed away. he was really old and sick. today he was supposed to go to the vet. but yesterday right before my dog passed i put him outside to go potty. i went back inside and was doing some laundry. about 15-20 minutes later i went out and called for him because he wasn’t barking to come him so i was like hm strange. well like i said i went out there and called for him and that’s when i found him dead. i feel so terrible because i wasn’t with him went he went. i feel terrible he was outside alone and not inside with me and our other dog. i dont know what im trying to get at here i just wanted to talk to someone about it i guess. i really miss him and i feel guilty. and it just sucks because he was also my dads absolute baby and he doesn’t even know he’s gone yet. my dad is in the bahamas at the moment and i haven’t spoken to him in a few days. do i tell my dad when he’s back in the states on his flight home to us or wait til he’s already back in our state 2 hours away? ,1,1728090251.0
"Do dogs need daily walks, even if they have a large yard to play in?"," We have a half acre yard, that has a perimeter to keep the dogs inside it. We let the dogs out at any time they want, and for however long they want. My question is.. do they also need to be taken on actual walks?
 One of our dogs (younger, small little brick dog) scratches at us and whines, even when she doesn't seem to want out, or food. Don't know what to do at this point 😕 I thought maybe it's too much energy. 

Some info: She was being abused unbeknownst to us by my late father in law, and had MAJOR anxiety. I don't know if the two are related ☹️ 
She is not a specific breed, she looks like a pug, but less pug face ya know? Kinda looks like a seal puppy.

Edited to add: I think we will try out some of the suggestions here, I appreciate all the advice! I forgot to add that I am in a lot of pain all the time, and that has contributed to my lack of walking the doggies 🐕 I will try some short walks, some training exercises and just engagement in general 😊 Thanks everyone who responded.

What are my options? Backdoor Roth IRA question. ,"I decided I wanted to have different sources of retirement income in addition to my 401K, so I started contributing to a Roth IRA in 2023. 

When I filed for taxes earlier this year, I received a notice my MAGI was too high and I needed to recharacterize to a traditional IRA; I completed the process. 

Since then, I’ve been too scared to contribute to my Roth IRA via backdoor because I started reading about pro rata taxes? Something like that. I have $0 in my Roth IRA right now and the money I recharacterized is sitting in the traditional IRA. 

What should I do to 1) resume (backdoor) Roth IRA contributions and 2) avoid undue taxes/mixing Roth/Traditional IRA money? I also read somewhere that before December 31, 2024, I shouldn’t have ANY money in traditional IRA/do something with that money?

Walking questions ,"I have a 4 year old JRT that has never been on an actual walk before. He is really high energy but we have a huge fenced in yard so he usually gets his energy out playing out there with us/the other dog/the kids/himself. He is very healthy and at a proper weight. 

I'd like to start doing a 5 mile walk daily with him. It is a flat, paved cement trail. Is it too much to do with him?  I don't want to cause him harm or hurt his paws. But I think he would really enjoy the outing and activity, as well as the one on one time. ",1,1726447337.0
[Advice] My dog hates crows,"Hi!

I have a 6 year old Pomeranian who loses her ever loving mind when she hears crows.

Pomeranians are barky dogs and that hasn’t been too much of a problem. From an early age I taught her the command “quiet” and she’s still very good at it.

Except when it comes to crows. 

I live in a rural area, there’s a murder of crows that live nearby. Their numbers keep growing. 

Idk what it is about a crow’s caw but she goes ballistic. She runs around barking, even when her trachea collapses because of how worked up she got, she still tries to bark and run. When we’re outside and she hears it, she barks and charges in the direction of the caw like she’s gonna do something about it.

The crows have learned they trigger her. 

This is where the nightmare has begun. 

They come at all hours of the day. The worst is in the early morning right outside my bedroom window. 

My dog doesn’t respond when I tell her to quiet when she’s raging over these birds. It’s like she can’t even hear me over herself and can only focus on them taunting her. I get concerned with how it sometimes exacerbates her trachea and I’m none too pleased being woken up.

[Breeds] please help me find a relatively quiet breed that's ok with cats,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First dog as an adult. We had dogs when I was a child, but I've never trained them.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* We live in an apartment, so I'd like a dog that doesn't bark much. Also, we have cats, so I'd prefer a breed with smaller prey-drive (I don't mind if they are not friends as long as the dog isn't chasing the cats all the time). I know look shouldn't matter, but I don't like dogs with very short muzzle, like Pekingese or pugs.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I was considering a Shiba inu, but I'd like a breed that is more eager-to-please. I don't mind if it's not the most eager-to-please breed as long as it's not a cat in disguise. I was also considering a Collie. We had a Collie when I was a child and she was the most loving, patient dog I've ever met, but I'm considered about barking.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just general obedience

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

* Probably two times one hour on workdays for walking (maybe also jogging, but it's not a must). Unfortunately, dog park is only possible in the weekends.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'm fine with anything as long as I can do it at home. I don't want to them to a professional.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium size

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is fine, we are already cleaning daily because of the cats. Slobber is ok too. As little barking as possible.  

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* On the snuggly side

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* On the more eager-to-please side

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Ignore them orb be friendly with them

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I'm willing to try to fix behaviour issues, but I prefer a dog that is not aggressive in the first place

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work from home so almost never

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My husband prefers medium to large size dogs. He'll probably help me just enough so that he can replace me if I'm sick or something. It would be nice if the children could play with dog sometimes.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, cats

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, elementary school age children

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No renting

Mom’s dog pooped on the porch. (vent),"
My mom for some reason doesn’t feel the need to enforce where her dog poops. I personally think it’s disgusting to find little turds on the pool deck and driveway. Oh and I love getting yelled at by her neighbor because her dog pooped in their yard. I’ve tried so hard over the last year to train it out of her. I went out of town for the weekend and came back to poo everywhere, including the neighbors yard.

This morning I let her out and she immediately tries to poop on the front porch. I say, “no lily go in the grass.” And she goes straight to the neighbors yard. 🤦‍♂️ I ran over to corral her into our yard, no worries about stepping on 💩 in our yard! lol But she runs to the driveway where she let one go out the bombbay door. I yell “no lily!” which scares her and she runs back to the porch to end the bombing sortee.

My dog!? Different story. He happily trots to the side yard to do his business and make sure there aren’t any squirrels in the yard.

Edit: I’m not looking for solutions. I know how to train dogs. I’ve been training an elderly dog that was never trained.",1,1731332873.0

Tips for dealing with guilt surrounding not playing with dog 24/7?,"Hi all - new dog owner here. Had a family dog when I was very young, but I recently adopted a 1 year old rescue who is completely mine! He's crazy and I love him (Jack Russell/Frenchie/unknown hybrid), he's so full of beans. I'm doing a Master's at the moment, so I'm in the house A LOT, but understandably not all of that time is play time, it's work time. 

  
I take him out for 2 substantial walks a day, totalling around 10,000 - 12,000 steps. On at least one of these walks, I'll run around with him on a green as he really loves being chased/chasing. I'll also play with him sporadically throughout the day at home, as well as cuddles and pets. He sometimes sits on my lap while I'm working, too. However - he wants to play/ have my attention all the time, and I have a hard time putting my foot down as to when enough is enough. I feel so terribly guilty saying no to him or not giving him attention when he comes looking for it. He does have toys and he loves to chew, so I'm not just leaving him with nothing to entertain himself either. 

  
I guess my main questions are, how do you know when you're giving your dog enough exercise/attention, and number two, how do you deal with the guilt of the puppy dog eyes waiting for you to give them attention? I think he just thinks because I'm at home, I'm available to play all day. Obviously he doesn't understand what I'm doing on the computer or when I'm reading/writing. I'm struggling to actually relax or enjoy any personal time because I feel like I'm being a bad dog mom if I'm not up running after him every second I have! 

Thanks in advance. ",1,1728417970.0
Paying back a prepaid retention bonus. What about taxes?,"I was awarded a retention bonus that will be paid now but won’t be fully “earned” until 1 year from now. If I leave, I have to pay it back. But what amount will I have to pay back? The language makes it seem like I’ll have pay back the gross amount, including taxes that are deducted from the bonus. So for example, if it’s a $10k bonus and 30% is deducted for taxes, I’ll net $7k. But then if I quit before it’s fully earned, do I have to pay back $7k or $10k?

What would you do in my position?,"Hi. I'm in a financial position I never thought I'd be in, and would like some advice on how to proceed.

Due to a recent redundancy and inheritance I am in a position where I have £50k in cash savings and a £250k house which is mortgage free. I am currently self employed making approx £30k per year (it's my first year). I have a lodger who's rent covers the household bills. I am 42 years old with no dependants and am single.

Lazy dog companion?,"Hey everyone,
I have an extremely chill chihuahua/terrier mix (4.5lbs) who spends most of her time napping, sniffing things, and pretty much has no interest in toys or playing. With the exception of post-bath zoomies. Based on that, I know she has the ability to be playful just maybe not directly with me. She’s not really into puppies and doesn’t want anything to do with my brother’s 30lb border collie/basenji who only ever wants to play. I’m wondering if any of you have similar dogs and if they’ve been more playful around other small, low-energy dogs?

Struggling with Partner's Financial Criticism and Unequal Contributions,"A good short title asking for advice/ I’m seeking financial advice. My partner and I agreed that I would take all maternity and parental leave (a total of 18 months in Quebec, 15 of which were paid) to care for our newborn child. Nine months after he was born, I started a master's program in counseling psychology. He agreed to co-sign a student line of credit with me. He never took any time off from his job, while I took all the time to care for our child. My son started daycare at 12 months, but due to feeding difficulties and other adaptation issues, the daycare frequently asked me to pick him up. After four months, I took him out and he was subsequently rejected from two other places (mainly due to not eating his meals and other behavioral issues related to separation anxiety). We decided he’d stay home with me for now until he was more mature.

Eventually, I had to be laid off because my job couldn’t keep me on leave after the 18 months, so I lost that income. I’m now at the end of my master's program and will begin my practicum in early 2025. Here are the issues I’m facing with my partner: he frequently brings up money and makes me feel guilty for using the line of credit (which I currently owe $43k on). He doesn’t appreciate that I stayed home with our son and downplays the fact that our son wasn’t ready for daycare. He also says that losing my low-income job (which paid around $55k a year) wasn’t a big deal.

He currently pays for my program, and we agreed that he’d cover the costs and I would repay him once I finish school. Since he helps pay for my education, he barely contributes financially to anything else and criticizes me whenever I spend money—whether it’s on food, clothing, toys, or even just a coffee. I’ve reached a point where he humiliates me, associating this with a lack of character and personality flaws. For example, he now says I’m financially irresponsible, that I’m a ""princess,"" and that I’m inconsequential. Meanwhile, I’ve spent half of my savings in my TFSA (about $20k) since our son was born.

As I mentioned, he pays for the school (money I’m supposed to repay), but here’s the issue: he barely contributes to anything else financially. He only covers half of the costs for wipes, diapers, clothing, and formula, which our son still needs due to some sensory processing issues and resistance to eating nutritious meals consistently. He doesn’t contribute to anything else in the house. He has his own apartment and comes to mine every day after work but sleeps at his apartment during weekdays because it’s closer to his office. He no longer contributes to food or anything else in the house, aside from the limited items I mentioned earlier.

I feel like I’ve made all the sacrifices to raise our son properly while still pursuing a master's degree to improve my career, even losing my job to protect our son. He doesn’t seem to recognize any of this and acts as though I’m taking money from him. Lately, he’s been offending and humiliating me a lot about it, and it’s affecting my mental health. I feel depressed when I think about the awful things he tells me daily (for instance, he says I’m financially taking advantage of him, that I’m an opportunist, among many other things). He can’t see reality for what it is and doesn’t recognize the sacrifices I’ve made. He maintains that he has to keep his job because he earns significantly more, but his savings are his alone, and his income is for himself, so it’s not like that benefits me in the long run.",0,1732281358.0

Dog beds: BullyBeds or K9Ballistics?,"So as the title states, I am at a crossroads with purchasing a dog bed from either

Option A: BullyBeds

Option B: K9 Ballistics. 

Budget: $400

I would like a dog bed that my dog won’t chew a hole in. For context I have a doberman who had an obstruction at 6 months old. He’s now 3 and I haven’t had any issues since then. I have been very careful with choosing what materials I put around him. He’s nearly stopped chewing all… Except for where he sleeps. I currently have him sleeping on one of those cheap elevated nylon dog beds from Amazon ($39). The problem is the nylon is too rough and it is making him shed excessively due to his hair being caught in between the nylon woven mesh. I would like him to lay on something nice, the dog deserves it. He’s a sweetheart. 

I would like to hear from those who have bought from either brand though :))",1,1727430571.0
Doggy talk,"One thing your dog would tell you if he/she/they could talk?

Looking for breed recommendations as a first time owner with 2 cats. 🐱🐶,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
Yes. I do not have any experience owning or training dogs. I have had cats all my life (currently have 2), but have wanted a dog since I was a small child (I'm now 28).


2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?
I love the idea of rescuing, but either is fine. As a first time owner I have concerns about training a dog out of potential bad behaviours previously learned if rescuing, and a pure bred from a breeder I may know what kind of personality to expect better. Maybe both those assumptions are incorrect.


3)	Describe your ideal dog.
A medium to large sized dog that gets along well with cats, and easy for first time owners. I'd love a dog that's mostly content with being lazy around the house or running around our yard. I like to go on some short hikes in the summer (usually 3-10km in length), and I'd love a dog I could bring with me for that too. A general love bug.


4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
King Charles Cavaliers sound perfect from the research I've done, and I keep going back to them. They sound lower energy, good with cats, and easy first time dogs. Open to other breeds for sure though.


5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 
Just the essential commands to be well behaved. Anything extra is a bonus but not priority.


6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 
No.

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
1-2 hours. 

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
No dog parks. We have a large yard, which I'd like to get fully fenced that the dog could run around in, or have a section of the yard fenced and dedicated to the dog. I'd like to take it for 1 walk a day, varying in time dependant on season. Our winters get very cold here, and it's just not feasible to be outside for extended periods all year.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
Yes I'm open to grooming at home, but a dog that requires less grooming would be better.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?
Medium, probably. I love large dogs but don't think they'd fit my life well.

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
Shedding doesn't bother me, slobber is not my favorite but could be handled, frequent barking gets under my skin a bit.

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
Not important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
Snuggly 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
Eager to please.

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 
Friendly or calm. I'm very happy if he/she loves everyone haha.

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
I'd prefer not to.

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
Nothing I can currently think of.

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
I work 4 days of the week, which the dog would be left alone for between 4-8 hours depending on the day. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
My partner loves dogs but doesn't love the work that comes with them. I know he'd be willing to feed and do some basic care, but I know he doesn't want to take it for walks or do any of the more ""active"" care. He has had dogs before whereas I haven't.

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
We have 2 cats.

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
No.

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
No.

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
Saskatoon, SK, Canada. Not aware of any laws banning breeds.

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
Summer can be 15C-35C, winter -10C to -45C. ",1,1726970174.0

Auto loan refinance question,"Currently with USAA at about 14% (I know) with about $6400 left paying $221/mo

Chevrolet silverado with 254k miles. I just rebuilt the engine and drove it home Monday. 

I see these things on Credit karma (specifically Caribou) and I know they are not pre approvals and what not

My credit score and profile is better than two years ago. I understand that in some cases to re-extend the loan for more interest in the long run vs just pumping more to principal can be illogical. 

I have eliminated all debts except for this one. Only bill is house payment. 

What would the opinion be on refinancing for 50% reduction in monthly payment (hypothetically) to continue dumping more money into principal? Regardless of ""total interest"" of a new note? 

Key notes: Cars value (year and mileage). Idk how the engine rebuild factors in to value. I don't believe a traditional banking system would refinance given this criteria. Possibly a credit union. 

If my plan is to dump to principal as much as I can would it be worth it to possibly refinance for a better interest rate and monthly payment just to save 50% /month ? I now have a significant portion of my monthly budget as disposable

Shorter or longer term HELOC if not planning on staying in house,"So long story short, my spouse and I were rather reckless with credit card usage between life/wedding/hospital expenses and we're in the hole pretty badly. To about the tune of $70,000 or so. 

As a last ditch effort to relieve some of the crushing interest (only on 1 income) my idea is to take out a fixed rate HELOC on the house (which has a mortgage about halfway paid down). This will allow me to get everything financially back on track at a much lower rate, SHRED and cancel all but 1 credit card, and actually have spare money at the end of the month to save/pay down extra/vacation/etc. The options are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years. Adding to this, we are not planning on staying in this house since it's very much a starter home in size, ideally within the next 2-3 years we want to sell and find a new one to move into to raise a family. 

So that being said, which length should I do for the HELOC? Generally I know the shorter term is better, you pay less interest overall even if the amount per month is higher. However, given that we are planning on selling in the near future, would it be better instead to do a longer term like 30 years for lower monthly payments now? Either way the remaining mortgage and heloc get paid off once a sale goes through, and I could use extra money in my pocket each month now vs realizing a bit more back later on when a sale goes through. 

Any opinions? Not really looking for other alternative financing options, just which length would be better to do. Thanks. ",0,1731751371.0

They removed my payment method, once I add it again it just says “choose a balance to pay” and it just says “amount due $0” with no option to put a custom amount WHICH IS WHAT IVE BEEN DOING SINCE THE FIRST TIME IVE PAID.

Is this more normal in Australia?,"I've gone through the Reddit guide and sent the questions to breeders on the breed club website. The ones that have come back always say a variation of the same thing:

1. We don't guarantee for behaviour because that's a training and socialisation thing. We do guarantee for health. Guarantee as in they will take the dog back. 
2. We have puppies available now. Or we don't now but this kennel does, contact them. 
3. You pick the puppy. They seem puzzled why I would explicitly ask for lower drive etc because their pups are apparently all similar and it's how I train/socialise them to mold them. 
4. Some don't elaborate much on the socialisation. Some have said the outcome after the dog comes home is totally on us because training/socialisation. 

Those would be orange/red flags according to the Reddit guide but these are breeders who are well known in the breed and tick all the other boxes. Is the guide more US centric?

These are Labrador breeders, is it a breed thing? I get training and socialisation because of course and I'm an experienced owner but there's also a genetic component to behaviour. ",1,1727298729.0

Make overpayments on mortgage or not,"Context: 

I am on the help the buy scheme (20% equity loan) on a £300k property. 2% rate expiring 2027. Want to buy a home with partner once that expires. House to purchase likely to be in the £450-500k range in this current housing market.

Do I make 10% overpayments now until expiry of current mortgage term to lower the principal and simultaneously save up for a deposit...?

Or do I just carry on saving for the next property, not overpay, and just remortgage the HTB loan in 2027?

Dilemma is obviously rates are going to be much higher than when originally mortgaged. So likely to be around 5% when I remortgage in 2027. So do I just lower the principal now and not pay the hefty 20% equity loan, and just keep saving for another deposit

Or

Don't do overpayments, don't pay loan in 2027, keep saving for deposit and just buy another house and rent this one out when the term expires - this provides highest cash flow in the short term. Trouble with this is the impact of adding the 20% loan amount to the principal to a much higher interest rate

Any thoughts / ideas are welcome!

Dog scratching help?,"Hi all! Our dog has become very mature and reliable, for the most part.

[Breeds] Looking for a small family dog suited for city life,"    **Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * This will be my first dog as an adult but I had a golden retriver growing up. 
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * I would prefer a rescue but would go to a reputable breeder for the right match.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * We are looking to get a small breed dog. I am a small lady and I want a dog I can walk by myself without worring about the posibility of the dog being stronger than me. We also live in a city and while we have lots of parks for a dog to run around in I think a smaller breed would be happier. I love going for walks so a dog that likes walking would be great and a dog with a good temperment is a must since we have two cats and a four year old daughter. I don't mind a dog that needs brushing as I already brush our cats and plus there are lots of local pet groomers in fact our vet has a grooming service. I dont want a dog that is too high energy but a cuddle bug would be great.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * My husband likes Corgi since he thinks they are cute and have a pretty good temperment. We have been able to ineract with a lot of corgi's and they do seem friendly and my daughter likes them. However, I do have concerns about a corgi's back since we have stairs in our condo. I am partial to mini poodles from what I have read they have a good personality and the fact they don't shed a lot is a plus. I also think a mini poodle would handle the stairs better. Granted we are usually upstairs so I am not opoosed to carrying a dog down the stairs I already carry my daughter. 
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Again we live in a city so I would want to train the dog some basic commands to ensure they stay by my side while on walks (with a leash but I dont want them to pull). I would also train the dog to play nice with our cats and the dog would be potty trained to only go to the bathroom outside. My husband had a bad experience with dogs where his mother let the dog go to the batrhoom inside on puppy pads and outside of potty training I want to avoid that. I would also teach the dog basic things like to sit and lay down. I am also open to crate training. My dog growing up wasn't crate trained but I want to do whatever is best for the dog.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * No
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * I hope to interact with them all day. I already give my cats tons of cuddles and part of the reason I want a dog is because I want a cuddle buddy. The dog would be part of the family so they'd be with us all the time. We have a dog park near by so I imagine we'd go there a lot to play fetch and let the dog run around andplay with other dogs. 
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * I love walking so I want a dog that can be my walking buddy. We have lots of gorgeous parks near by and my daughter no longer depends on a stroller so I plan to take the dog with us wherever we go. So on weekends this basically means spending the whole day outside. On weekdays I work from home three days a week so on those days we'd have a walk in the morning, then we'd spend my lunch hour outside and then we'd have another walk at night when my daughter goes to bed. On days I am in office the dog would still have a walk in the morning and evening. There is a doggy daycare by my work that I think I would use for the dog on in office days. 
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * I am open to doing regular prushing and trimming nails as I do that for our cats. I remember having to clean our golden's ears when and it honestly wasn't that hard. As for trimming I would leave that to a professional . I'd budget around $100 or so a month for grooming. 
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Small, something that is under 25 pounds
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * I am fine with all three but would probably prefer not a lot of barking as we have neighbors.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * I would not let my dog off-lesh in an unfenced area. It would be too dangerous in the area I live in. Drivers just do not pay much attention. But I would happily let them run around in a fenced in area. 
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Snuggly, I want a cuddle buddy who is also my walking buddy.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * Eager to please
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * I would love a dog that greets vistors. Our cats hide when strangers come over and it stresses me out because I am always worried of finding them in an emergency. So a dog that likes strangers would be wonderful.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * I would not. There are simply too many dogs being walked in the area I live in and I don't think I could handle it. 
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * I would need a dog that can be trained out of being nippy. I dont want the dog to playfully nip at one of the cats and hurt them. 
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * Both my husband and I are homebodies and we only travel once a year for christmas. I work from home most days but on in office days I plan to put the dog in a doggy daycare. For christmas travel my mother (who lives a block away) has already agreed she would watch the dog. My parents have owned many dogs over the years all of which have been very happy and healthy 
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * My husband does not want a dog that relieves itself in the house. His pet growing up was allowed to go to the bathroom on puppy pads and this has given him a bad opinion of dogs. I told him this wasn't normal and the dog would be going to the bathroom outside.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * We have two cats. One is a tabby and the other is some sort of short hair, we found him on the streets so no idea what he is. 
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * Yes, we have a four year old who is turning five soon. We have taught her to be very kind to animals. She knows not to pick them up or pull on them. She is very good with our cats and likes small dogs but is afraid of bigger dogs.
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * We own our condo and do not plan on moving. 
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * Philadelphia, PA and not that I am aware of
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * It is humid in the summar but rarely gets over 100F and in the winter rarely below 30F
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    * Getting a dog I am capable of walking myself is very important so I am very steadfast about a smaller breed. I have seen dogs get away from people because the dog was too big for them and I do not want to risk that. So please keep in mind I am a small 5'1 woman. I would hate to get a dog that is too big and is able to rip away from me and runs off getting lost or wose getting hit by a car.

Culinary School Loans and Then Some ,"Wondering if anyone has any suggestions?

Me: 41M, Executive Chef at a retirement community.  Single with a 12 year old who I have 50/50 custody of though never married and I live alone in a 1 bedroom that I pay $1950/month for.

Annual income before tax and 3% 401K contributions - $74K.

Spent almost $10K on a lawyer to gain 50/50 and as a result have to pay that back $7K in loans on CC's as well as a friend who loaned me $3K.

I also owe about $4,500 in taxes after erroneously filing 2 years ago. (This is accruing interest unfortunately.)

I also have a car loan that has about $15K left.

And finally I have student loans from culinary school that I have not ever been able to pay on that are sitting at about $50K.

Any thoughts from anyone on any of this?  Besides filing for bankruptcy as I am not inclined to do this as it will only forgive portions of my debt.

Edit:
In MA...
Take home after payroll deductions: $4100/month
Rent:  $1950
CC payments (total): $500
Car payment: $400
Car insurance: $160
Cell phone (including my daughter's phone): $200 but this will drop marginally over the next 6-10 months
Utilities (gas/electric): $150
Internet: $65
Subscriptions (Netflix/Prime Video/Music/Shopping etc: $70 (soon to be $50)
Groceries: $200-$300/month
Gasoline: $150/month


If my maths are mathing I should have approximately $200-$300 left each month.  That's assuming I don't have to also pay for things like new tires recently or oil changes, car taxes, and emissions (all in the last few months).  Not to mention summer camp which is $2K.

[breed] recommendation for a lifelong cat lady ,"I have been a cat lady my whole life. When I met my husband, we each had cats, but combining that number of cats really aggravated a mild all ergy into something bad. He put up with it for years but since our last cat passed about a year ago, his breathing has been better. He grew up with dogs, so he said he’d be interested in getting a dog. He had a German shorthaired pointer but he lived in the country and had space. We are in the suburbs. I don’t really know anything about dogs so I’m hoping to get some suggestions. 

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* My first but my spouse had a dog growing up 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I don’t really know. I’d like a dog that likes to snuggle and doesn’t bark. I’d like a dog that doesn’t need a ton of running with a person. A dog that’s good with kids so our kid can participate in caring for it. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My friend had a chocolate lab and that was the best dog ever. But I don’t really know anything about dog breeds. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic dog commands. But my husband really wants to train the dog to go skiing with us. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I really don’t know. I can bring a dog to work with me when I go into the office and that is 3 days per week, so I’m hoping to get more interaction with the dog that way. My husband also works from home so the dog will not be alone much. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 2-3 20-30 minute walks at least. We also have a park in the neighborhood where the dog can be off leash and there are dog parks not too far, though those might be a weekend activity. Like I’ve said a lot, I really don’t know much about dogs so if I need to adjust my expectations, I can do that. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I grew up with a long haired cat that required a lot of grooming, so that wouldn’t be my preference. But basic cleaning and grooming is ok. We would use a groomer for more detailed grooming. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* I’d prefer a medium sized dog. I really do not want a small dog

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Not a lot, especially the barking. I’d prefer shedding to barking. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This is not an issue for us

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* snuggly 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* no preference 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* No barking. I’d prefer if the dog was friendly to strangers rather than aggressive 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Barking is my big concern 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* At least one adult works from home M-F so the dog might only be alone for an hour or so during the week. On weekends, we’d plan to bring the dog skiing and leave it in the van for approximately 2 hour stretches. This seems very common where we ski. Summers we are mostly home or would board the dog when traveling. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My husband really wants a dog that is less likely to cause all ergies. We also have a 5yo who is a little scared of big dogs. Our neighbor had a GSP and that dog would knock him over when we visit their house.  Our other neighbors have a doodle mix that’s smaller and our kid likes that dog

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, our 5yo and similarly aged neighborhood kids

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Vermont, not aware of any restrictions. But I don’t want an aggressive breed

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* 75 F in the summer and well below freezing and snowy in the winter

Advice on how to pay for college 4 kids in 8 years,"I created this burner account seek feedback on how to manage my financial situation around paying for kids college.  My wife and I are mid-40’s, have 4 kids, all 2 years apart in school, and we’ve agreed to pay for their undergraduate degrees for in-state which runs about 25k/yr each.  We’re doing ok with regards to planning for retirement in our MCOL area with a $1.4m NW, but $1.2m is tied up real estate equity or retirement funds, so only $200k or so liquidity to pay for this.  Admittedly we didn’t do the best job saving to pay specifically for college thinking our income situation would be different, but life happens.  Our oldest is a sophomore in college so it hasn’t been difficult as we’ve been able to split that between savings and regular income, but I’m staring at a 6 year stretch of $50k per year on top of living expenses.  Our net income monthly is about $10.5k and FASFA results was basically to deplete my savings before taking loans, but we don’t have a ton of savings monthly right now outside of retirement due to raising 4 kids with 3 of them having cars, insurance, groceries, etc.  After we finish the schooling and get our kids established we’ll be able to stash a ton of money for future retirement, but interested in hearing feedback on how to manage basically a $350-400k expense across an 8 year period.  Should we pull back on retirement and shift our savings to this?  Take college loans at higher interest rates?  Do we drastically adjust our lifestyle and cut monthly expenses?  Deplete savings and YOLO (not preferred, haha)?

Dogs are fighting out of the blue.,"Hey Guys, recently our dogs:

It has gotten so far that we have decided to let the corgi stay at another place (where he normally goes when we are away for the weekend). Recently the corgi came back as we believed it to be over but after about 30 minutes they start to bark to each other and we need to keep them apart in two separate rooms.

"What would u do in my situation? Buy, Rent forever, or Wait?","Hi all,

I’d love to hear what you’d do in my situation. Here’s a bit of context:

* **Location**: Los Angeles County
* Age: 30 and 29
* **Household Income**: $280k (DINK)
* **Current Situation**: My husband and I bought a house last year with a 5% down payment and a 5.75% interest rate. The house has an ADU, so we’ve been house-hacking by living in the ADU and renting out the main house. Our tenant covers about 70% of the mortgage, and we’re paying less than we did for rent in the past.

Now, we’re ready to move to a bigger home in a better neighborhood and have a kid. This time, we won’t be house-hacking and plan to rent out the ADU at our current property for extra income.

* **Savings**: We have 20% saved for a down payment on the next home.
* **Questions**:
   1. Would it be better to do another 5% down payment instead of 20%, and invest the rest in index?
   2. Should we consider renting instead of buying and invest the difference between rent and mortgage payments?
   3. Should we wait for the housing market to cool down?

Given the high interest rates and crazy market conditions, I’m torn about the best approach. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",0,1731693297.0

Our English bulldog passed away in her sleep,"Our English bulldog Nibby passed away in her sleep sometime early this past Saturday morning, she was almost 11.  She was our first family dog, that our boys had grown up with all or most of their lives. Around 6am my wife found her in the recliner where she almost always slept at night, but she was already gone, but looked peaceful like she just didn't wake up. Nibby had been slowing down and sleeping a lot the last few months but she had been eating and drinking and going to the bathroom normally.  Friday she had been outside with us laying on the porch in the sun like she always liked to do, and she ate her food at dinner, nothing really different than any other day.  It hurts now that I can't remember how she was when we went to bed that night.  We always envisioned that one day down the road we would have to take her to be euthanized, so this came as a total shock to our family.  We had just talked about making more memories with her on her next birthday in a couple of weeks.  We talked about what to do and decided to take her to be cremated later that day at the only place locally that was open (a place just for pets and they were extremely helpful and compassionate).  We brought her home yesterday with a lot of tears.  We also have a German shepherd Callie she just turned 1 on Sunday, I feel like we didn't give her any time with our bulldog after Nibby had passed so she could realize what had happened, and now she is constantly looking for her.  It keeps going through my head that the last time Callie saw Nibby was us carrying her out the door wrapped in her favorite blankets to take to be cremated.  I also am feeling regret that we got her cremated so soon (it was a Saturday and all our vets were closed) and without really finding out how or why she passed, whether it was a heart attack or cancer or something else, but we didn't know what else to do.  Her next regular vet checkup was supposed to be next week.  We are glad to have her back home but just feeling like we should have done things slower or a little differently, it all seemed so sudden and we were not prepared at all.  I think our family is hurting even worse knowing we didn't really get to say goodbye.",1,1728588446.0

Grand Children 529 Strategies?,"We want to contribute to our grandchildren's education.  Is there anyway to contribute stock that has a low basis directly to a 529?  I think I know the answer...  If not I suppose that it makes the most sense to convert that stock to cash, thus lowering the value of what we want to contribute, while paying the taxes on the sale ourselves, thus increasing the cost of our ""contribution"".  THis also gets us a bigger bang for our gift tax exclusion, since the contribution will be smaller, ie net of taxes.  Or, or, I suppose we could contribute the stock to a kids custodial account, they would inherit our basis, and then our kids would be responsible for taxes when they decide to liquidate for education?

Help me find matching dog.,"1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Second dog. Not much experience, none I would say even.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Preferably purbread from reputable breeder, I think, but all's good if dog's good for our lifestyle.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

Nice, safe to be around.  
Preferably cuddly, big and fluffy (would be bonus, but I'd first and foremost look at character).

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Well, if I would have ANY bread of dog I could and give them propper care, enough exercise/place to run and so on, I would either have Golden Retriver, Samoyed, Irland Seter, Beagle or Malamute... I would consider Bloodhund or German Shepherd also. Possibly more, but those would be mine first choice(s).  
More than not, unfortunatelly, I just go by look of bread, as I'm not knowedgable how they should behave. If that's make sense and sorry for that.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Tricks, games deffinitly.  
Wish I could train dog to be mine or my husband's medical assistance dog as we both could use one for different reasons.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Well, if I could use dog as mine/my husband's medical assistance if needed, then that would be great. Outside of that - no. No experience.



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Well... IF I'd be still unemployed or work from home, then just as much as dog need. If not - then still as much as dog need, when I'm home...

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

I don't have good stamina and all, so 3-4 about 30-40min rather slow walks daily definitly. Sometimes either longer or something more like dog park or forest hiking, if I have health to do so.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I don't mind brush dog daily or clean their ears/teeth daily\\as needed. I may be able to bathe dog if needed, but that may be difficut for me ('cause of how my bathroom looks like...). However with nails and/or coat trim I would rather go to profesional grommer as needed.



\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Would have big if could, apartment suitable for small-to-medium.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Don't mind any. But I'd prefer they bark on command and teached reasons (so someone knocks to door or my phone ringing, but not just because they are bored and wanted to play).

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It's not necessary per se, but would be nice to have control over dog in said areas even with no leash.



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I wanna dog that's cuddly and friendly, but can and is able to take care of him/herself when home alone or I need to do something for example.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I'll respect dog's boundaries, but a friendly, loyal dog, that's safe to be around it's my preference. Don't mind if he/she wouldn't be clingy all day long, I love cuddles, but I don't want him/her to be aggresive.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Alarming me in person, like come to me and bark/place paw on my leg or something (I'm deaf so I could use some dog's ears and some sort of assistance with noices in apartment like knocking, boiling water and such). Friendly or at least neutral to strangers, but weary of those who's dangerous (like - neighbour come - dog shall be polite and nice, or at least great with wiggle, sniff and off to it's bed to play it goes, but when someone break in alarm me and/or guard... if that makes sense).

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Well... My first dog was agressive (...wel, behaviourist say he was not exacly, but still) to other dogs and was sometimes kinda hard to control/pull back then (was medium-to-bigish sized), so I would rather not go trough that again.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

If it's possible - low-to-no risk of separation anxiety (my first dog had that unfortunatelly and it quicly became spirally worser as I got a job for short period of time).



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Depending of if I got a job and what job do I get. For now - I'm unemployed and seeking, so I'll be 24/7 at home, maybe few hours in some days to do shoping or to doctor apointment. Sometimes I have apoitments with docs in other city, so that's depending... dog could need to be alone for half a day or just go with me and hubby would walk him around when I'm in (if we agree that I go in alone)...

If I got a job - depending of what kind... so can't give definite answers... But I'm looking for typical 9 to 5 office job, preferablly at-home even, so... probably that.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

My husband will care of our dog as much as I, and as best as he can, but is a bit... more careful around dogs and may need bit time to trust it (he had accident including dog... unfortunatelly... - he's not scared, but visibly more weary than he was to unknown dogs).

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

None and no, possibly.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Poland, I dont think any breeds are banned but ""aggresive"" breads may be subject to some regulations.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

From +/- -15 in winter to +/- +35 in summer (lowest to highest, aprox...).



\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

I'm deaf, hubby have rheumatism. We both have cardiological problems. Therefore we may or may not have health to long, adventorous walks everyday, and sometimes may be days that dog only will get one medium-distance walk and rest would be even shorter.

If dog somehow can help me by being my ears or my husband by being his execirse partner (not sure how exacly dog can help someone with rheumatism, so... let's say that)... and signalise both of us when something is off with other's hearthrate/blood pressure, would be more than great.

Looking for a dog breed - are my expectations too high?,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

**ANSWER:** I've never had a dog just by myself. I grew up with multiple dogs; however, I haven't trained any of them. I only shared some of the duties rather than fully handling them by myself (I've been around dogs my whole life, though I'm not sure how that counts). I do have theoretical knowledge, though, and I've always felt I understood dogs quite well.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

**ANSWER:** Yes, I'm not sure if I would be able to fully address a dog's negative experiences, especially if the dog is anxious. I prefer going through a reputable breeder.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

**ANSWER:** A small/medium-sized dog (I consider German Shepherd as a large dog, and I'd need to be lucky with its genes for it to fit into a medium basket) that is intelligent and offers some, but isn't aggressive by default. I don't want my dog to kill me in case I make mistakes in the early training :)). I do want the dog to be emotional though. I'm considering a Chow Chow, but they seem rather aloof. We've had some experience with a Maltese Shih Tzu, and we were charmed by how human-like her behaviour was whenever she saw someone crying or struggling. She provided a lot of support.

Both my partner and I will take care of the dog. I'm less active physically; however, I'd prefer a dog that doesn't require more than 1.5 hours of daily basic exercise. We're likely going to provide that minimum, but I know that on certain days, we might not be able to.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

**ANSWER:** A Maltipoo or Maltese is our default choice. It meets all our preferences. However we'd preffer to have wider choice pool.

We are also considering:

* Chow Chow - ideal size if female, seems as lazy as me, though I have concerns about potential aggression and lack of warning before biting
* Miniature Shar Pei (same concerns as above)
* Shiba Inu - great balance, stubborn but might be a bit too large, I think?
* Mudi - apparently incredibly intelligent, which is both a pro and a con. I am, however, concerned about the exercise level it requires to be handled properly

Dogs I'm dreaming of but am unlikely to manage: Doberman or German Shepherd

Dogs I wouldn't like to have: any terrier

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

**ANSWER:** Loose lead walking, basic fetch and similar activities, lie down, come, sit, toilet training, stop, quiet, find, stay, and crate training. I'd like to take my dog to puppy school to socialise it from an early age. There are lots of dogs around our park and neighbourhood.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

**ANSWER:** Not at all

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

**ANSWER:** At least 45 minutes of training every day, at least an hour a day of walking (split into a few outings)

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

**ANSWER:** Mostly walking (outdoors), training primarily indoors but outdoors as well. Playing and training seem the most suitable types of exercise.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

**ANSWER:** At least once a week. I'd be willing to pay a professional to do it though, and I intend to start from the earliest possible age so the dog will be easier to handle in the future.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

**ANSWER:** Small-medium. I’d probably struggle to handle dog heavier than 16-18kg.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

**ANSWER:**

* I do not care much about shedding so it is not a problem at all
* Barking may be a problem, we live in quite big apartment, echo may be a thing.
* Slobbering/drool may be problematic, I never dealt with dog that is drooling/slobbing

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

**ANSWER:** Not really important, but in case there is some “leash incident”, I do not want it to start exploring by running away like there is no tomorrow.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

**ANSWER:** A mix of both, to be fair. I like dogs that are needy and I don't mind being their pillow, but I'd understand if the dog prefers to have some time alone.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

**ANSWER:** Hard to say, but it would be great if the dog didn't treat me and my partner just like automatic feeding machines :D

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

**ANSWER:** I've never met a dog that wouldn't bark when someone is knocking at the door, so I'm quite okay with that. I'd prefer my dog to be friendly with people I greet but naturally suspicious of strangers.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

**ANSWER:** I will try to minimise unreasonable aggression from the puppy's earliest age. Definitely more training would be required if I decided to choose something bigger than a Maltese.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

**ANSWER:** I'd lean more towards a female dog. I want to make sure the dog gives a warning before biting. I don't want barking every single time the dog hears another dog in the stairwell. I'm not really a strong person, therefore random acts of aggression and uncontrollable pulling on the lead wouldn't work if the dog is very strong.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

**ANSWER:** Hardly at all, as we both work remotely and it's extremely likely we'll both remain this way for the next 15 years.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

**ANSWER:** As I mentioned, we are a couple. We both share the same preferences. My partner is more active than I am, though.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

**ANSWER:** Not until I have the opportunity to live in my own house (not likely in the next three years).

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

**ANSWER:** Not at all.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

**ANSWER**: I do rent a flat/apartment currently. Small/medium dog, no definition provided.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

**ANSWER:** Poland, no breed restrictions to be fair. I am not interested in large aggressive dogs.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

**ANSWER:** From -20 celsius (-4f) during the winter to 35 celcius (95f) in the summer.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

**ANSWER:** Moving with the dog will not be a problem in future. There are a lot of dogs in the area (95% leashed).

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

**ANSWER:** How does my experience with dogs translate into 'sole ownership' of a dog? I've spent my whole life with dogs, mostly mixed breeds, but I was only handling part of the responsibilities. The dogs I've dealt with had mostly just basic training and were mainly medium/small-sized, so that's kind of my comfort zone. I can somewhat read/understand them, but I'm not sure how significant that is. I struggle to estimate my level of practical experience.",1,1732133243.0

Question on stock sales and AGI,"Hi all,

I had a relative pass away in September whom I have inherited some stock from in a taxable brokerage account. Per Fidelity, I will only pay taxes on the stocks based on the gains made after the date of her passing in Sept. Most of these stocks are relatively flat and I'm not concerned about the tax gains.

However, I am concerned about my AGI as the financial aid I get for our kids' school is based on that. If I sell a stock worth 25k, even if it has minimal taxable gains, will my AGI go up 25k for the year?

"Please Help an Old Lady - Need to Use Debit Card as Credit to Qualify for Cashback, But Don't Know How","TL;DR - how do I get my debit card to work/run as a credit card once I'm at the cash register paying with my phone when I am never offered that option?


I did search before posting and saw about 9 threads asking how to use credit card as debit card, but none the other way around.


Basically I have started receiving money via PayPal, and took a moment to read their fine print. They offer 1% cashback, but ONLY if/when the card is used as credit - no cashback if the pin is used. 

BUT...

* 95% of the time it **automatically runs as debit requiring my pin**, never having been offered the option to run these transactions as credit,

or 

* 5% of the time at Gelsons and this one gas station, I'll put my phone against the thingamajig, waiting to enter my pin, only to be handed a receipt and I'm done... because it's run itself as credit. This is what I want (but there wasn't an option in how I wanted to run it here either, guess my point is I know that it CAN be run as a credit.

Mixed Feelings about New Puppy…,"Just for context, I will not be giving up the puppy. She’s mine forever now. It’s more about expectations I had. 

I recently adopted a puppy from the shelter. I am firm in believing about adopting, I don’t even consider breeders as I have never wanted to bring a creature into the world where there are already so many that need homes. I have had success adopting dogs. I adopted one puppy who was a stray 8 years ago and he is my soul dog. He’s seriously amazing. In 2019 I adopted a dog who was a year old. She was a bit more of a challenge as she was feral for 9 months. So she had a lot more behavioral issues that I had to work on, but she was an amazing dog. Both dogs are big dogs. My first, J, is 92 lbs. Bennie, was 85 and muscular (pitbull mix). I took these dogs everywhere with me, we’ve been backpacking, paddle boarding all over the US. They were my dog pack.. In July, Bennie suddenly passed away. She was only 5. 

I have been missing her and her crazy energy so much lately. My partner and I talked and we decided to get a puppy. As they are (in my opinion) easier to train and blank slates. I searched on petfinder and found a pup that I really liked. When I went to the shelter he had already been adopted, so I felt obligated to get his litter mate. There’s nothing wrong with this dog. She’s very sweet and funny to watch. But I have a feeling she’s some sort of terrier by her ears and her body shape. I have a love for larger dogs. And I think I’m just putting too many expectations on her to be like Ben or like what I’m used to. I know when you adopt a dog you have no idea what they are going to be, and I know eventually I’ll love her, but right now I’m just having a hard time because I miss and wanted my big adventure dog. Does anyone have any advice on terriers? I’m thinking she’s a rat/jack Russell lol

what do you do with poop?,"First time home owner. We moved in May. We have two labs, have been using a scooper to pick up their poop, and have been putting the poop in an area in the back of the yard where there's lots of small trees, ivy, and other debris.

Is a car refinance a hard credit check?,"I bought a car with a terrible interest rate that I needed (or felt) at the time. 11.5%.

Auto Purchase Advice,"I purchased a 2015 BMW 328i xdrive as a certified pre-owned with 35,000 miles on it back in the summer of 2018 for just under $28,000. In 2018 I was making $70,000 annual, had student loans, and with the auto loan had around a total of $50,000 worth of debt. Yes, I know, I paid a lot of stupid tax and know it was not the greatest financial decision now. I was 28 years old then.

In 2019, I got serious about improving my financial situation. I paid off the car back in 2020 and have enjoyed no car payments and low insurance premiums ($730 annually now) since then. What I have not enjoyed is how expensive the car maintenance and repairs have been. Since the maintenance plan ended in the same year of 2020, I have spent just under $10,000 in car repairs / maintenance (tires, brakes, shocks, sensors failing, you name it, pretty much everything besides transmission or engine related). I have paid cash for all the repairs.

The BMW still runs great and is in very good condition with 107,000 miles on it now. I love the car, but have been reflecting on the purchase of it and wishing I bought a more practical car at the time. I bought a house in 2021 with my fiancée (we agreed to a cohabitation agreement) and the BMW hasn't been very useful around the household (needing to transport large boxes / items / bags, paying premium gas for long road trips to see family, we don't have kids but we have a dog that I don't let him travel with me in the BMW sadly.

I have been considering a compact SUV would be a better vehicle for me and family. My base salary now is $126,500. I paid off the students loans at the beginning of this year. My only debt is the mortgage. Total home expenses at $1900 a month (mortgage, escrow, internet, water, waste), other monthly expenses is $235 (auto insurance, cell phone, subscriptions), I save $2500 a month (15% retirement, 10% employee stock purchase). My monthly disposable income is $2200. Net worth \~$340,000 with around $30,000 liquid cash (savings / checking).

I have been looking at purchasing a new 2025 Hyundai Tucson Hybrid Limited. MSRP $41,195. I've done my research and the vehicle fits what I'm looking for - good 35 MPG, good engine, regular gas, normal 6-speed transmission, good repair cost / maintenance, leading cargo capacity and technology features. The Tucson is actually in stock at dealerships compared to RAV-4 or CRV and has more features in general. It would also come with a 3-year maintenance plan and 10-year / 100k mile powertrain warranty at no extra cost. Hyundai is also offering 48-month financing at 0% APR until the end of the year, so I wouldn't be paying interest on top of a depreciating asset.

From what I've read the Tucson would fit most of the generally accepted car affordability pieces of advice I've seen for me. No more than 35% of gross income. I would look at private selling or trading in the BMW for $6-9k and put it towards the 20% down payment. Looks like the monthly car payment will be around $780 a month (10% or my income) which I would pay extra money to pay off sooner when I can (as I did with the BMW).

Would this be a good, logical financial purchase? Or should I keep the BMW? Any advice would be appreciated.

(I am not really leaning towards buying used because all of the compact SUVs I'm interested in within the last 5 years (Tucson, RAV-4, and CRV) are still mostly above $20,000-40,000 depending on the milage, but could still be convinced)",0,1731607482.0

Best Way to Use Assets for Home Purchase,"Thanks for reading.

* Brokerage: 145K (100K VTSAX / 45K VMFXX)

What do I do?,"Hi.

So not to make this too long - I am fostering a staffy/pit mix. She came completely untrained, no leash training. Not used to the city. She is 4,5.

She is smart and not aggressive at all. We managed to leash train her somewhat and the city isn't too scary anymore. But - she is super reactive to other dogs - she will not approach them without bolting and jumping on them, and she jumps on people too. We tried to work with that, but...I don't know if I can,.  


The other day she bolted so strongly my hand got twisted in the leash and I pulled tendons in two of my fingers, resulting in worse function, which is not good since she is so strong.

The biggest issue is that she is way too strong and has too much energy. I know I am not strong enough to handle her if something were to happen. 

I am very guilty and frustrated, but I think I will not keep her, which was the original plan. I just don't think I can. Its creating issues in my relationship.

Now my SOs mom is givng her pug up and I really love that dog, so I suggested getting her. But the truth is, we cannot have two dogs.

Contributed while over the Roth IRA income limit a past year and am ineligible for a backdoor conversion,"I know this topic is often covered here, but I haven't found a post where the OP wasn't eligible for a backdoor conversion. I seem to have just barely run out the clock. 

I was over the AGI to contribute to my Fidelity Roth IRA for 2023. I filed my 2023 taxes in April 2024.

My fidelity advisor said I will need to file a Return of Excess Contributions to withdraw the $6500 I contributed in 2023 and its earnings. She said this will be filed by Fidelity with the IRS as an early withdrawal based on my age. She then said I will have to retroactively amend my 2023 tax return,  file a 5329, and also file an 8606 to essentially tell the IRS that this wasn't an early withdrawal but a return of excess (to avoid the 10% penalty on top of my 6% penalty).

[Breeds] - Dog breed recommendation for a city couple.,"
[Breeds]

Introduction

	1.	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

	•	No. We’ve had dogs in the past. They were all adopted at least 2 years old and were already housebroken. They knew basic commands, which we reinforced, and we taught them more basics.*

	2.	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

	•	Either.*

	3.	Describe your ideal dog.

	•	I prefer a female dog that is good with our 4-year-old Siberian female cat (who was raised with interactions with dogs and is great with dogs that aren’t barkers). I want a non-barker that is medium-sized and able to fit comfortably in a 4-door sedan, leaning towards the larger side. The dog should have long hair with medium maintenance and low anxiety, as we live in a city where it will need to be okay with sirens, horns, and the occasional fireworks. It should be semi-active—a running companion would be nice, but it doesn’t have to be. Normal activities would include long and short city walks, dog parks, hikes, and leisure time.*

	4.	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

	•	We initially considered Cockapoos and Miniature Labs but learned about the poor breeding processes associated with them. We are now looking into Cocker Spaniels or other Spaniel types and Poodles.*

	5.	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

	•	House training, basic sit/stay commands, fetch, speak, etc. We’ve trained our cat to follow some basics, so I’d be interested in venturing into more advanced commands with a dog.*

	6.	Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g., agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g., hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

	•	No.*

Care Commitments

	7.	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

	•	2-3 hours.*

	8.	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly, and does that include using a dog park?

	•	1-2 hours.*

	9.	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

	•	I’m willing to brush 3-4 times a week and am open to doing most of the grooming at home, with professional grooming once or twice a year.*

Personal Preferences

	10.	What size dog are you looking for?

	•	Medium—18-25 lbs.*

	11.	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

	•	Medium shedding. Non-barker (as noted above regarding the cat). Minimal slobbering.*

	12.	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

	•	I don’t expect the dog to be unleashed in an unfenced area.*

Dog Personality and Behavior

	13.	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

	•	Snuggly.*

	14.	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

	•	Its own thing.*

	15.	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

	•	Since we live in an apartment, I wouldn’t want them to bark at every single door noise. I would like the dog to come upon entry and warmly greet visitors and strangers.*

	16.	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

	•	No. We live in a city, and they will be exposed to many dogs on normal walks.*

	17.	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

	•	Being aggressive, excessive barking, and being prey-driven.*

Lifestyle

	18.	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

	•	Minimal. We both work from home, so the dog may be left alone for a few hours during dinners and get-togethers a few times a week.*

	19.	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house, and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

	•	My partner and I have made a mutual decision to share responsibilities for caring for the dog.*

	20.	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

	•	Yes, a female Siberian cat who is 4 years old. She has had many interactions with dogs while we dog sit or visit my parents’ house (who have two dogs). She’s great with dogs.*

	21.	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

	•	No.*

	22.	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

	•	I rent and have no limitations on pets.*

	23.	What city or country do you live in, and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

	•	I live in North Jersey, USA, and I’m not aware of any laws banning certain breeds.*

	24.	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

	•	In North Jersey, typical summer temperatures average around 80-90°F (27-32°C), while winter temperatures average around 20-40°F (-6 to 4°C).*

Additional Information and Questions

	25.	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

	•	Our cat is better behaved when we have a dog in the house. It keeps her entertained, and we know she would benefit greatly from a companion.  We live in a major city but do have a decent size apartment (1600 sqft) with a private outdoor deck.*

	26.	Feel free to ask any questions below.

	•	No.*

The other dog is a Morkie, which is a mix of a Maltese and a Yorkshire Terrier. They both are opposites, one has a huge fur coat and loves winter. And the other is hypoallergenic (a dog that has hair not fur) and loves warmer temperatures in stead. We live in a state that generally has all seasons and all temperatures.

Some additional info, he loves other dogs and people. This may sound bad, but he loves to hunt; we have a large backward and he catches a lot of things lurking around in the back.",1,1728155764.0

Credit score questions,"Hi! 

I currently have a 738 as a 25 year old male. Some mismanagement a while back dropped me down but I have recovered and am ahead now, but want to increase this number so I have some ideas. 

My only debt now is my motorcycle. 

I have a motorcycle payment, but is 2.9% so I really don't care to pay it off early although I could afford to pay it today. It's good to have this auto payment every month right? What I spend in interest I gain in credit? 

I want to buy another motorcycle, although much cheaper than the last(this is my hobby) and would pay cash. Unless. Does it make more sense to pay off the other one and then apply for a new loan for a different motorcycle? 

I also want to open a new CC (amex platinum) that would have a spending requirement to earn the bonus points. Do I put motorcycle on the card and pay card balance then to earn bonus points? The only way I think this would work is cash advancing the money because purchase would be private party. Then just paying the balance at the end of the month? Or stretch it out maybe 3 months?

"[RIP] Jasper, Bichon Frise, 14","Earlier today, my best boy was put to sleep and my heart is broken. He was a bichon frise and the most gentle dog I've ever met. He was a massive wimp but he absolutely loved everything and everyone.

He was coming up 15 in three months but he acted like a puppy till the end. He barked at his food and threw his biscuits around almost every single day, he'd playfight with my mum when she'd get in from work, even when he would get tired after about 30 seconds.

His decline was steady but then he fell rapidly. He was deaf and blind for a while, but when the dementia went full force, he hardly knew what was going on around him. His legs were weak, even smoothing his back could make him buckle, he'd lost over a kilogram since we last took him to the vet a year ago. He didn't really respond to being petted, he wandered around aimlessly and just stared into space.

The vet told my parents that it was the right time and that he probably would've done the same, which makes us all feel a little less guilty. I want to think that putting him to sleep was a kindness but it is so hard to tell yourself that when it actually comes down to it. We all knew this day was coming soon, and it made us sad to watch him exist without living.

Hopefully he can be with our other bichon who died 2 years ago, he was infatuated with her so I know he'd love to see her again.

anyone else’s dog shedding like crazy this year? ,"Hello! My german shepherd (3F, spayed) has been shedding an unusual amount this year, like full on blew her entire undercoat. She’s never shed this much before during shedding season. She went from being a double coat to single coat dog 😅

Her bloodwork came back completely normal and she’s eating, drinking, pooping just fine. Diet and exercise has been the same too. I’m in the SF bay area and it’s been an extremely long and hot summer for us up until a couple weeks ago, so maybe it’s caused by the unusual weather.

Employee Stock Purchase,"I wanted to get people thoughts on the best thing I could do with an opportunity my job offers. 

It is an employee owned company that lets us buy stock at a 15% discount from the fair market price. When the price reaches around the low $30 mark they do a split. 

I looked at how often they do splits and it looks like roughly every 10 years. I get dividends at about $0.03 per share owned and I can keep all shares if I leave the company. 

With that said, not sure what the best thing to do is. I was between taking a loan and buying enough that a split or two would net me a nice retirement egg or just buying every week. 

Weekly I could comfortably buy a few shares, maybe like 5 at a price $20 without worrying about it. 

If I were to take out a loan I'm not entirely sure how much I would do. I could free up the same amount I would pay a week and do $400 a month for the loan payment.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?   
We would prefer grooming only a couple of times a week. We would be willing to brush, clean, and trim but not at the level of a groomer. We would be willing to take a dog to a groomer. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?  
Medium to large. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Equal involvement. Same preferences.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?  
2 cats

Nope. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
Rent currently. No weight constrictions.

Need help understanding why one would do an annuity,"So the other day a family member said I should pull the trigger and retire in a few years and setup an annuity.

Now here am I wondering, why in the world would anyone actually do this?  Is there a legitimate use case I can't think of?

Ultimately my thinking is boiling down to, if you have the capital to go with an annuity, why would you not just pay yourself out from that to begin with?

Pet insurance - advice on lifetime policy,"Hi!

I was wondering if anyone could give any advice on a question I have.

We currently have a lifetime policy in its first year that is due to end in December, and we have renewed the policy for year 2. Our dog needed to go the vets a couple of months ago as she had some itchy paws but it cleared up very quickly with no additional visits needed. So the total price came to £150. Our excess is £100 so we decided we would not claim as to not drive our premium up with the claim.   
  
I am now concerned that come next year, if the itching comes back and turns out to be an allergy or skin condition of some sort it will obviously cost us more in vet fees and at that point we will want to claim(not for the previous £150 though). At that point is it possible our insurance may decline the claim as they will be able to see on the medical that she had the visits in the previous year but we did not tell them about the issue? I am concerned they could pull some sort of ""didn't tell us about the condition"" card and say they can't cover it.  They didn't ask for any medical history prior to us signing up for our 2nd year, however if we do need to claim we will need to send the history. 

Am I right to be concerned, or because its a lifetime policy does it not matter if we didn't tell them because it still occurred whilst we were under their cover for year 1?

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am fine with weekly grooming, but would prefer not to have to brush out my dog daily. As for professional grooming, we currently take our cats twice a year, and I would plan to do the same with any dog.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* I would prefer a medium to large size dog

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is fine, though less is better. My wife dislikes slobber quite strongly. I would prefer a dog that doesn't bark constantly, but will react to people passing by my back yard.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Nice to have but not mandatory.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggles are fine but not necessary, don't have a strong preference.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I'd like a dog that's independent-minded, even if it makes training a bit more difficult. 

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* I am okay with a dog that is cautious around strangers, and in fact would like one that would not let random people in the back-yard. 

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I'd prefer not to but its not a dealbreaker.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Howling at night, anything too smart(my aunt had a 1/4 coyote 1/4 wolf 1/2 mutt and the intelligence was a huge pain in the ass. Was capable of holding grudges and formulating plots to get back at people sneakily), can't have anything that'll chase the cats. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 4-5 hours while my wife is at work, more days than not. Rarely more than that.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My wife will be home at times while I am at work, and can make sure the dog is checked on, let out to relieve itself, etc. But I will be putting in 80% of the effort here. She has no preferences besides a lack of drool, and an affinity towards Blue Heelers because that was her childhood dog.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have two one-year-old Turkish Van Cats. We dogsat for a friend as a test and they did alright.

No other pets are currently planned.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Nope, own my own place

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Canada, specifically Northern Saskatchewan

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Winter: Average temperature in coldest month of -17C. Average min temperature of -24C overnight. 
* Summer: Average temperature in hottest month of 18C. Average max temperature during day of 24C.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* This dog will be mostly in my yard during the warm months, and then when the temperature dips below freezing will be kept inside. I have a huge problem with homeless people transiting through my yard, depositing garbage, breaking the locks to my fence to do so. A large dog should dissuade them. They tend to go to ground over the winter so I have few problems then. Consequently, whatever dog I get needs to be okay with being outside most of the time, but also okay being inside lots.
* Where I am, availability is very consistent for all manner of working dogs, retrievers, and livestock guardians. I consistently see litters that are mixes of collies/shepherds/retrievers/etc. What I have been considering most strongly is a Golden or Lab crossed with a Great Pyrenees, as they seem to be readily available and match my needs reasonably well. I don't have the ability to get any particularly rare or out-there breeds, I'm simply too isolated. I looked into a Bergamesco but the trip out to get one would cost me over two grand including lost wages...",1,1731624736.0

Should I liquidate holdings before transferring IRA & brokerage away from NWM?,"**TL;DR** \- Wanting to transfer a Roth IRA, a joint brokerage account, along with spouse's IRA and Roth IRA away from Northwestern Mutual to Vanguard. I'm planning to ditch every NWM holding for Vanguard's target date funds and hopefully forgetting it for several years. 

* Do I need to instruct NWM to liquidate before initiating the transfer? Are there any consequences to that? 
* Also, a bonus question about term life and long-term disability insurance.

Hi r/personalfinance. Longtime lurker, first time poster. 

I've realized the error of my ways in choosing to invest any money with Northwestern Mutual. The fees are approximately 1.7%, which I've now realized is insane. I’m looking for some advice/thoughts on this plan of action and my questions below.

I opened a new Roth IRA and joint brokerage account with Vanguard. In speaking with Vanguard about the current holdings with NWM, they explained that some of the holdings were not transferable and would have to be liquidated before the transfer. I then explained that I intend to liquidate everything and invest in a target date fund. The agent then said that I could then instruct NWM to liquidate everything first and then transfer.

I should also note: I have made no additional contributions to either accounts since their inception. I’m outside the bracket for IRA contributions now.

**My first question:** Is it accurate to say that I should instruct my NWM representative to liquidate the holdings to prepare for transfer? Is there a better way to do it?

**My second question:** What are the consequences of liquidation versus transferring the transferable holdings, for both the brokerage and Roth IRA?

* It will likely shock no one that the performance is shit. My Roth IRA has a dollar-weighted rate of return of 4.53% over roughly 3.5 years. (I don’t have my wife’s performance in front of me at the moment, but I believe it to be similar.) It’s also not a lot of money: Mine has a current value $45,000, gain of approximately $6,000. (My wife’s Traditional and Roth IRA account balances are higher, approximately $125,000 total.)
* The joint brokerage account is even worse: Just 0.67% dollar-weighted rate of return. (It was set up as a sort of rainy day fund to just beat inflation, but it clearly hasn’t even done that.) $25,000 starting balance, $600 of gains in 3.5 years.

**My third question:** My wife and I also have 30-year term life insurance and long-term disability (LTD) insurance through NWM. Should we keep these policies? Anything to look for?

* We opened both policies several years ago. While we haven’t had any major health issues since, I’m thinking that underwriting new policies would probably be more expensive.
* We are 36M and 35F with two young kids, one more on the way. The term life and LTD make sense, from what I’ve read. If one or both of us passed, the financial burden would be big and that’s the purpose. When the policies expire in like \~23 years, the kids will be older and we’ll hopefully have more financial independence by then.

I will say, to their credit, my NWM representative never tried to sell me whole life insurance. In fact, once I asked about it (as an idiot) once, and he told me no, it’s not for you. He said to ignore the mailings and emails from NWM corporate, that’s not a good idea for you. This is probably what lulled me into a false sense of security with the investments.

Appreciate everyone’s thoughts. Cheers.",0,1731605855.0

"[RIP] Kal, large mixed, 7","I lost my dog yesterday 

I had my foxhound/anatolian shepherd mix since he was a puppy almost 8yrs ago. He was the first dog I raised by myself. He was a handful for the first 2yrs at minimum and my husband and I fought a lot about whether I should give him away. Kal got better and my husband eventually accepted him. Kal was like that dog from Marley and Me. He would condor in and jump on the fence, bark nonstop at people and would not listen. I took him to so many obedience classes. The connection I had with Kal wasn’t instant but it grew steadily and for the past 4-5yrs, he was my “baby”. 

I miss so much about him. Whenever I would see him sleeping on his bed and I’d approach him, he’d thump his tail loudly on the floor, excitedly awaiting me to approach, then he’d flop over on his back so i could give him belly rubs. Whenever I would crouch down by him while he was standing, he’d always turn and rest his head on my shoulder, or he’d come up and nuzzle into my legs so I could scratch his ears. 

He lost 9lbs in 6 weeks and I had just taken him 6 weeks ago to get moles removed (that thankfully were non cancerous) and got x rays and bloodwork. The vet wasn’t too concerned about his findings.

Fast forward to 6 days ago, Kal was a lot more lethargic and picky with his food. His belly was getting bloated yet his hipbones and spine were protruding more. Then yesterday he wouldn’t eat at all. Not even the tasty human food. I took him to another vet that’s 24/7, and X-rays and bloodwork now show a giant mass in his abdomen and him losing a lot of blood, as well as liver and pancreatic issues. My options were try a surgery that probably would end with him being euthanized while under, or euthanized right there. I wanted to bring him home and follow up with his regular vet, but i honestly don’t think he could’ve made it through the night at home. So I was either I’m and he passed in my arms. I miss him terribly and feel like I failed him. I feel like the vets lied to me. Kal had the exact same thing my previous dog did and a part of me questioned if they just told me that to push an expensive surgery and it wasn’t that serious. I know that’s crazy, the vet thought euthanasia was the best option, not surgery. And it was far less expensive than a surgery so why would they even do that. I am just shocked. I feel this hole in my chest and I miss my boy.

Thanks if you read all that. I just needed to put it out there. I miss him and wish I had him with me still. ",1,1728299009.0
Finding the right sidekick to add to the family!,"Hi all, thanks in advance for your input and advice! 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?



\* No, I’ve raised two dogs, and often watch my friends’ and family’s dogs. (Maltipoo to Doberman to Doodles)



I adopted a 2yo purebred Jack Russell 3 years ago however, and cared for her for 10 months but realized we were not a mutual fit due to her intense hatred of other dogs (my family nicknamed her Mike Tyson after she tried to bite my cousin’s dog in the ear). She had been raised by an elderly couple inside of an RV during covid, so she had no social skills and rarely was exercised unfortunately. She was super dog-aggressive and anxious. I took her to professional training twice a week and had to walk her 5-8 times a day to get her energy out, along with runs and playtime. The aggression was what made me realize it wouldn’t work out, as I live in a city and I think she needed to be on a farm. Rehomed her after this, and she is doing better! 



2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?



\* Would love to rescue, but my needs are pretty specific, listed below



3)	Describe your ideal dog.



\* Looking for an active small sidekick! I’d love a dog that is ok living in an apartment with me, but going on daily walks and the energy to go on long hikes, backpacking, and traveling on weekends. I want a smart dog that I can teach tricks, but not a lunatic like my Jack Russell. Needs to get along with other dogs well (will socialize the dog and train him/her young!). Also, my girlfriend has allergies to dogs, so looking for a dog that doesn’t shed too much. I also would like to be able to occasionally take the dog in the plane for short trips (not a dealbreaker, but nice to have). Another nice to have would be to have a dog that can learn decently reliable recall, I’d love to be able to take the dog off leash in safe areas so they can follow on a hike or do their thing



To sum up:

* Active, able to keep up on hikes and runs (when an adult) and go reasonable distances. 
* Low allergy risk for my gf
* Small enough to take anywhere
* Friendly with other dogs and people with socialization
* Not a crazy barker, although I am willing to train that if necessary
* Recall is possible through training



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



\* I’ve narrowed it down in my research to border terriers, it seems they are pretty stout little guys and switch between apartment living and long hikes. They are also pretty good with humans and other dogs. I’ve looked at mini schnauzers as well and mini poodles, but am worried about barking for schnauzers and energy for poodles. Little worried about recall with Border terrier, seems like they require quite a bit of training for good recall, which I would be able to do. Let me know if i’m totally off or missed anything!



5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?



\* Tricks would be fun but most importantly a good recall, basic commands (sit, down, leave it, stay, etc), and good leash manners.



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?



\* I would be open to doing a sport if it helped the dog gain confidence. But it would be less about winning and more for training/confidence for the pup



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?



\* Happy to do 1-1.5 hours of walking/running + active games/training a day. Otherwise I work from home so happy to do 4-6 short walks. Understandably more time for a puppy. 



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  



\* 1-1.5 hours. Walking, fetch, hide and seek, hiding treats, etc. Yes there are a few dog parks near me, I’d love to take her to meet up with dog friends to play. 



9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?



\* I can do 5-10 mins a day or take them to a groomer when necessary. Happy to cut nails and bathe the dog too.



\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*



10)	What size dog are you looking for?



\* Small, would be nice if they could fit in a small crate to go on the plane in the cabin from time to time, but not a dealbreaker.



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



\* My gf is allergic to dogs (manageable with medication + less dander/shedding), so the less the better. I live in an apartment so a small amount of barking is ok, but ideally I can train them to bark less or when it’s reasonable.



12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



\* Fairly important, it would be nice if I could train a consistent recall for going hiking or emergency situations



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



\* Definitely a dog that likes to snuggle. Ok if they’re sometimes aloof but definitely prefer a sidekick that wants to snuggle and receive some love!



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?



\* Eager to please 



15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  



\* A bark is ok, but not uncontrollable barking. I’d prefer them not to jump (happy to train this), and learn to be patient and sit until the person comes to them. 



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?



\* No, I’ve dealt with this before and I want a dog that can get along with other dogs. Ok if the dog is defensive where appropriate.



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



\* Just dog/people aggression and also don’t want a dog that is afraid of everything



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



\* I work remotely, but would like to be able to leave an adult dog alone occasionally for 4-5 hours when necessary.



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 



\* My gf will help care for and walk the dog, but I will be the main caretaker. 



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



\* No current pets



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



\* No



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?



\* I rent but there are no restrictions on dogs. 



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?



\* USA, N/A



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?



\* Summers in 80-90ºF and winters of 40-50ºF

"[BREED] My furry companion of many years has grown quite elderly, and I would like to look into getting a new family member to learn from her before her time to cross the rainbow bridge arrives.","\*\*Introduction\*\*

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* No. I grew up with dogs and got ""my"" first dog, a female 3 month old Siberian Husky, when I moved out of my parents house at 18. She has been the best companion, and has gracefully grown quite elderly. Aside from her, I have a male German Shepherd (11 years old) whom I've had since he was 1, and a Nova Scotian Duck Tolling Retriever who recently passed at almost 16 whom I had since she was 8.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

\* I would prefer a rescue, but am not opposed to a breeder. Price is no object.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

\* When the time comes for me to take this step, my intention is for this dog to be my companion. He/she will go most everywhere with me, including work. I lucked out with my husky - despite me knowing very little about training all of those years ago, she learned so incredibly quickly. I was spoiled by her, as most other huskies I've met since haven't been nearly as gentle, maternal, and as obedient as she has been. I'm looking for something highly trainable, intelligent, and loving towards the entire family (i.e., the other dogs and cats, my girlfriend, and nieces and nephews when they occasionally visit.)

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* N/A. I am wanting to learn, as again, I was spoiled with my first one. Aside from size (I prefer medium - XL dogs) I've no oppositions or expectations on what breed to choose from. Jumping in and out of the cab of my truck on their own is ideal.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Staying close to me when not on the leash is a must. Basic commands (sit, come, stay, heel) are also necessities.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* Multiple hours daily.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* 1-2 hours. Fetch, walks, swimming in the river. Not a dog park, but a regular park.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* I can trim nails, but prefer to avoid cutting hair. I'm happy to take him/her to a groomer monthly.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)What size dog are you looking for?

\* Medium - XL

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* Shedding and barking are no concern. I'd like to keep slobbering to a minimum.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Very important.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Snuggly would be ideal, but it is not a deal-breaker.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* More eager-to please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* I don't know if this is an outlandish request or not, but I would like a dog that would notify us of a knock at the door or someone in the yard and then become friendly towards that person upon seeing our reaction to greeting them or via a command.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* One-track-minds. I.e. if it starts chasing a rabbit and ignores commands to return.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* Very seldom, and when he/she is, it wouldn't be longer than 3-4 hours.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* The only other person in the house is my girlfriend, who is also a dog-lover. She will be a large part of the dog's life, as well.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* 1 older male German Shepherd, 1 older corgi mix, 1 scarlet macaw (only ever outside of her cage with my supervision), and 4 inside/outside farm cats.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No, however I would like it to be loving towards my nieces and nephews when they come to visit.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* No.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* I live in an extremely rural area in the Ozark Mountains.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summer - 85 degreees F. Winter - 20 degrees F.

Should we buy a car now? ,"We have a '12 SUV with 213K miles
We have a '15 sedan with 200k miles
Both are paid for (no loan)

We have about $5000 saved for a new car right now (I could pull together another $1500 or so if I had too, and MIGHT get a year end bonus, that MIGHT give us another $2000 to use for a car)

We're saving $500 a month for a new car currently - that would the money we'd use for a payment too. With increased insurance, that'd put us at a loan amount of about of about $25,000 for a 60 mon term. 

I can not decide if we'd be better to buy a car now (ahead of tariffs or something major happening to one or both cars), if we should try to buy 2 cars (like one with a $10K loan and one with a $15k loan), or just continue to save until we HAVE to replace one and hope that the $500/month budget can actually get us something worth even buying?? 

I've been spinning my wheels on this for months - What if rates jump? What if the car market gets crazy again and our $500 payment can't really get us a car that feels worth a $500 payment? What if we buy a new car and immediately need to replace the other? I know no one can predict the future but any advice would be so appreciated.  ",0,1731720105.0
Time to refinance our house?,"So here are our factuals:

* $375K home value
* $299K left on a 30yr fixed mortgage with 29 years left on the mortgage.
* 7.29% interest rate, currently.  Freedom mortgage is my servicer.
* 730+ credit score with impecable history
* We are definitely NOT living paycheck to paycheck.  We take home roughly $110K per year combined, no kids, and I have 350K in VTSAX on top of our normal retirement fund accounts.  No other loans on anything other than the house.  
* We are both in our early 30's and we're 15-20ish years away from retirement.  No immediate plans to sell our house.  No plans to have kids at this time.

I am seeing people getting rates around 5.5% in some cases.  I called Freedom Mortgage and asked if we could do some type of in house refi.  They came out of the gate with a ridiculous offer of 7.1%.  I laughed and said I would call them back.",0,1732131302.0
[Breeds] Help us choose our first dog,"**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?** 

Yes this will be our first dog. Me and my partner both grew up with dogs, but have never had one as adults.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?** 

Would prefer to go through a reputable breeder, but wouldn’t be opposed to rescuing. The big concerns I have with rescuing is us not having the experience to handle complex behaviour issues, and the dog not getting along with our two cats. However, skipping the puppy years is appealing!

**3) Describe your ideal dog.** 

Medium size. Independent and able to do its own thing, but still affectionate. Ideally the dog would be ok with just going for a couple walks and playing for a bit most days, but able to go on longer walks, hiking, or swimming once and awhile. We want a dog that doesn’t need constant attention and stimulation once it’s an adult. Is peaceful with our cats. I am also very interested in obedience training so I want a dog that would be well suited for that.

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** 

We have looked at golden retrievers (a bit large but has a lot of the traits we’re looking for), cocker and springer spaniel, miniature schnauzers, beagles, and corgis.

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?** 

Obedience, crate training, recall, tricks.

**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)?**

 If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? I have looked at agility training and would be willing to do classes with the dog, but that wouldn’t be the purpose of getting a dog and I don’t want that to be a necessary part of the dogs life.

**Care Commitments** 

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?** 

We’ll have about 15-30mins in the morning for a walk, 30mins at lunch (with either myself if I’m working from home or my younger brother who does pet sitting), 1-2hrs in the evening. 2-3 hours total of hands on interacting most week days (and obviously more than that during puppy years). We would have more time on the weekends.

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?** 

1-2 hours most days. I have heard bad things about dog parks so I’m a little nervous about that, but my parents live a minute away and they have a chihuahua and a large fenced in yard so I’m planning on taking advantage of that. Exercise would consist of walks, playing fetch or other games, and some mental exercise like training. There will be days where the dog will get more exercise, but also some days where it’ll be less so we need a dog that won’t lose its mind if all we can manage that day is a walk around the block.

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

Brushing is fine, I’m ok with a little grooming. I would prefer a dog that doesn’t need to be taken to a groomer every few weeks (I’d rather deal with shedding tbh), but this is something I can compromise on.

**Personal Preferences** 

**10) What size dog are you looking for?** 

Medium size ideally. We could go smaller, or a bit bigger though.

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?** 

Shedding doesn’t bother me much. Some barking is fine, ideally though I don’t want a very yappy dog that barks at absolutely everything. I do not like slobber at all.

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?** 

I would really like to do recall training and not have to worry about the dog running away. Especially if we are camping or at a beach or something.

**Dog Personality and Behavior** 

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?** 

Mostly prefers personal space. But of course snuggles are always nice.

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?** 

If eager-to-please means easier to train, that would be preferred.

**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?** 

I don’t mind some alert barking, but not excessive. I wouldn’t want the dog to be aggressive towards strangers.

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?** 

I wouldn’t want that at all. If that happened I would probably reach out to a professional trainer.

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Not that I can think of right now.

**Lifestyle** 

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?** 

During week days if I’m not working from home, for the mornings and afternoons (I will have my brother come during lunch). Ideally the dog would be ok being at home alone for a while.

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?** 

It’s just me and my partner and we are both in agreement about what we want in a dog.

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?** 

We have two adult cats.

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?** 

Not regularly but I am planning on trying to socialize the puppy to children though because I don’t want any aggression there. Me and my partner may have a kid during the dog’s lifetime though.

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?** 

We own a home with a large yard.

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?** 

Not aware (located in Canada), but I’m not really interested in bully breeds or any breed that may possible be banned.

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?** 

Summer can range anywhere from 25-40 degrees Celsius (77 - 140 F) depending on the humidity. In the winter usually around -15 to -25 C but we usually get a few cold snaps.

20 y/o looking to start investing during internship ,"Hi, 

I will be doing an 8month internship as a junior in college where I should be able to save 4k / month, right now I have a brokerage account and a Roth IRA that I opened to start investing when I start getting paid. I was thinking of maxing out my IRA with more aggressive LETFs like QLD and only investing in VOO in my brokerage since I will be investing much more in my brokerage so I want to take less risk whereas my IRA from what I read at my age it would be better to be more aggressive since the potential returns are much higher and it would be tax free. 

I was also wondering if I should be some money in a regular savings account as well that would be easier to take out if needed (I’m fortunate enough to have my parents behind me in case of an emergency so not sure if I need a savings account). 

 Looking for advice on what I think of investing in, also would it be smart to not invest everything at once and keep some to continue investing next year in case the market goes down so I can lower my average price since I won’t be making any money until summer 2026 after this one.

Kinda jealous that I’m not my dog’s “person”,"I know this isn’t his fault and there’s a bunch of different reasons why my dog likes my husband better, I try to not let it get to me but sometimes it just makes me sad.

Don’t get me wrong, I know Benji loves me! It’s just so obvious that he loves my husband more. I’m the one who does the primary work like vet appointments and grooming, I buy his food, I do his training, order and give him his medicine, I boil his eggs every week, etc. We are 50/50 on walks and feeding. But he just likes playing and cuddling with my husband more even though I try to play and cuddle the same way.

The thing is, I’m the only person who has been around my puppy since day 1. He was originally my mom’s dog, I took care of him because I was still living at home. When I moved out, I had a temporary period of being away from him, but my mom had to go back to india to take care of her dad who was ill, so she gave him to me permanently. By that time, I had moved in with my (now) husband, so Benji moved in with us. 

At first he was hesitant towards my husband because he doesn’t really like men, but now he’s warmed up so much to him. At night I wake up and see that the dog is spooning him, which is funny and cute, but makes me feel bad that he didn’t come to me.

Like I said, I know this isn’t Benji’s fault and it’s not really about me, it’s just hard to not take it personally sometimes. I’d never change the way I treat him though, I love him with all my might. And as I mentioned, I know he does love me. He’s always thrilled to see me when I come home from work, he does give me affection and come sit with me plenty of times, I just wish that he wasn’t so obvious about who he prefers. 

When we were at my mom’s house, she used to be a bit jealous that he obviously loved me better, but that was kinda cause I did all his care and walks, so I thought it was pretty natural. Now that I’m still his primary caregiver but he likes my husband better, it just feels kinda unfair sometimes lol",1,1729516467.0

has anyone here travelled with their dog with separation anxiety?,"Hello! I’m looking for stories and tips in terms of crate training a dog. 

Our dog will be travelling 2 weeks from now and they started their crate training a month ago. We could see a small progress in terms of his patience but recently, he refused to go inside his crate even though there’s food or his fave toy. We seek a professional trainer for him as we only have limited time, we were shocked to know that our dog has separation anxiety. because he’s always fine whenever we leave him alone in the house. 

They’ve been training him for 3 days now at the training center, and they are not seeing any progress. I really hope that he could overcome the anxiety for his ease of flying in the cargo. (but i know he’ll be hella stressed)

Should my wife start a retirement account?,"Trying to figure out if it makes sense for my self-employed wife to open a retirement account. Rough stats as follows:

Ages: 35-40

My TSP (max contribution): ~$400,000

Emergency Fund: $25,000

No car payments. We owe ~$270k on our home but have a 2.8% rate so we’re just paying our monthly’s. Mortgage is ~$1800/mo.

We have been putting ~$3k a month into the vanguard which is what we would re-allocate to a retirement fund for my wife if that were to make sense. We don’t have kids, nor does it look like we will at this point and we also have family history that indicates we will die in our 60’s.

Should I finance a new truck,"I have a 2004 Mazda b3000 with 182k that is going to need new cylinder heads and most of the front susoension components reolaced soon.

Adopted very scared puppy,"Update: she’s made a lot of progress in a short amount of time. She was willingly coming out of her crate to be around me yesterday. I think my boys are still a little too much for her. But she does allow them all to pet her and give her treats. She’s also been sleeping in our bed which I know is probably not a a good idea but baby girl wanted to lay with me and I couldn’t say no 🥺 She’s not yet wanting to go outside so I’ve been carrying her outside two times a day. The rest of the time she’s using puppy pads. Last night when I was putting all my kids to bed, she was howling for attention and had the zoomies. I think we will get there eventually 🥰

I just adopted a 5 month old mixed breed last night and she’s terrified. She came from a foster home and had 2 siblings with her but they’ve already been adopted. We were told she was very sweet and good with cats, kids, and other dogs. I have 4 boys ages 2-7 so good with kids was a huge thing for us. Plus we have 2 cats. She was very attached to her foster mom and foster dog brother. 

I brought her home last night and she’s so scared. I immediately put her in our bedroom to decompress with a crate, a blanket from her foster home, food and water. She likes cheese so I’ve been using that as a treat. She did eat her food and went potty outside, but she won’t follow me on a leash so I have to carry her outside to go. 

She slept all night in her crate without a peep. It’s morning and I opened her crate up because she needs to go potty but she won’t come out. 

Just needing some reassurance/advice/support that I didn’t just make a huge mistake in adopting a terrified dog that hates us. We are planning on going very slow with her and following her lead. ",1,1730546926.0

Breed Recommendation / First time dog owner,"**Introduction**

Hello guys, so I am thinking about owning a dog and I could really use some advice regarding this topic. I am still overthinking everything, but I am looking forward to your insights! 

Sorry for bad english, I couldn't be bothered with Grammarly or ChatGPT today. It's not my first language.  


**Will this be your first dog?**

Yes. I've never owned a dog before and there as never a dog present in my childhood.

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]?**

I would like to rescue a dog, but preferably a puppy so I can train it properly into adulthood – and I would like to know at least something about its background (breed of parents, so I can expect a size and character). But I am not against buying a dog too.  
  
**Describe your ideal dog**

Medium size dog. Easily trainable, intelligent, cuddly, active – but not too much like border collie, as I don't have the lifestyle for it. Easy companion dog that I could play and cuddle with, and that could fit in my lifestyle.

**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I like golder retrievers, for their temperament. But they might be too big for my apartment. I also like croatian shepherds and australian shepherds for their character, but I think they would be too much for first time dog owner in apartment.

**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Essential commands, but recall and off-leash behaviour is most important for me.

**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

No.

**Care Commitments**

**How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
  
I work from home, pretty flexible and easy stable job, so I could interact with my dog during work in little breaks often. I would prefer to walk it two times a day, before work and after work/in the evening. Also I can take it outside during my break around noon sometimes for a quick walk.

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

I live near two dog parks, so I would go there during our walks on weekdays – active play and stuff. Maybe in home I would give him some mental stimulation toys and such.

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

I would pay a professional quarterly if the dog has difficult coat, but regular hygene I would do weekly.

**Personal Preferences**

**What size dog are you looking for?**

Medium size dog. I really don't want small dog.

**How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Shedding and slobber – I would prefer less.  
Barking – I am personally ok with it, my neighbours also have two loud dogs and I don't mind.

**How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

I would prefer to keep my dog on leash in urban areas, but when I go to nature or outside of city trip, I want the dog to be obedient off leash. It's important for me, for those kind of trips.

**Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Affectionate.

**Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

I guess more of a balanced dog. I would like to train it with professional from the start to work on separation anxiety.

**How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

I am ok if dog gets excited, but I don't need a guard dog. I live in apartment, so I would like it to be ok with strangers and visitors. As I mentioned before, I would work with a professional to ensure I socialise him from early age.

**Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

I mean, no. That's why I would like to work on training with professional as soon as possible. I want to ''mold'' the dog into a sociable and as calm creature as it can be. That's why I am a bit sceptical on adopting adult dog.

**Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Aggression and separation anxiety.

**Lifestyle**

**How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Probably 1-3 hours a day in the late afternoon, if I go to gym or grab a coffee, go to movies etc. Sometimes I would leave him alone for few hours on friday or saturday nights. 

**What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

No other people.

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

Nope.

**Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Not regularly, but I want my dog to be ok with children, especially my nephews that live nearby.

**Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

Nope.

**What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

Croatia. Nope.

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

35 celsius during summer, winters are usually -5 celsius.

**Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

**ESSENTIALS:**

Breed Recommendations for a Teacher/Nurse family,"My partner and I have been talking about getting a dog in the next few years. We both grew up with dogs and we miss having one around. I am a public school teacher and he is a nurse who works the night shift at a hospital. If we are to get a dog, we would wait until the summer when I am off from work so we can dedicate plenty of time to the crucial puppy/new dog stage.

**Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Both myself and my partner have grown up around dogs our whole lives. My family had two dogs, Killian (GSD/Lab) and Bates (GSD/Malinois). Currently my parents have a GSD named Otto. My partner's family had boxers and we frequently babysit their current boxer, Amos. I had no part in training Killian, but as a college student and adult, I spent a lot of time with Bates taking him on walks, trips, teaching tricks, and other quality time. This dog would be our first dog together as adults.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We both have talked about wanting to get a dog from a breeder rather than a shelter or rescue. We would prefer having our first dog together to be more predictable, though I am open to looking into specific breed rescues.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

An ideal dog would be one that is friendly towards everyone and would like to spend time with the family. We would also like a dog that is happy to relax but can also enjoy long walks and play time. We live in a pretty active town in a smaller apartment so we would like a dog that can thrive in a more suburban environment. We also want a dog breed that is easily trainable and not very stubborn.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We have a list of different dogs that we have talked about. Golden retriever, lab, greyhound, poodle, and cocker spaniel are ones we are both interested in. I Goldens and poodles are just great, all-around dogs that would fit a lot of our needs. Greyhounds are on the radar because they are more active in short bursts instead of needing hours and hours of physical activity. I've also been looking into smaller breeds like shih tzus, pekingese, and coton de tulear since their small size would do well in our 1-story apartment and they are loyal and friendly companions.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? We are both pro-crate training. This would be important for us especially during the day when we are away. I am also going to do leash training so we can take the dog on walks on the various hiking trails in our area. In addition to basic commands, I would also like to teach fun tricks. I've taught Bates some fun tricks like playing dead, army crawling, and fist bumps.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

We are not interested in competing in any sports. We don't have the time to train for these consistently.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

During the summers and holidays, I can devote most of my time to the dog's training and exercise. During the school year, the dog would be able to get at least one hour of walks a day, in addition to the evening hours 7-10pm for playtime, training, and interaction. We do not have children, so the dog would receive the bulk of our attention in the evenings.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

The dog would be able to get at least two 30 min walks per day. When my partner is off, the dog could get a third 30 minute walk in the afternoon. We could also provide about an hour of additional exercise in the evenings through playing fetch, tug, etc. We have access to a dog park if needed but I would prefer to avoid it due to safety concerns.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am open to daily brushing, learning how to trim hair, clean ears, clip nails, etc. For long-haired or curly-coated dogs on my list, we are willing to seek professional grooming as well.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Any size, provided the breed can adapt to living in a small 2bd apartment.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

We can handle shedding of any amount. We would prefer a quieter breed, or one that is willing to laze around during the day while my partner sleeps after his night shift. We have neighbors upstairs with 2 dogs that bark and their barking can make it hard for my partner to fall asleep. I do not tolerate drool or globs of slobber of any amount. I am ok with dog kisses, but I don't want to receive slime baths. My in-laws boxer is incredibly slobbery and it is hard for me to tolerate.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

As of right now, it is not that important as we cannot let dogs off leash in our neighborhood. But this would be something I want to train in case we move to a house without a fence. A dog with good recall is really important to me, again for safety reasons.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A mix of both would be nice. I never had snuggly dogs and my dogs growing up were not allowed on the couch. This is still something my partner and I are compromising on! If the dog isn't snuggly, I would still want the dog to want to be pet and relax where the people are. Bates did not like snuggling at all, but he was very persistent about being loved on with pets. He gave kisses and would make us hold his paws while he layed at our feet.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

More eager-to-please. I want a dog that enjoys training, is quick to learn, and is highly motivated.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

We want a dog that is friendly to strangers, children, other dogs, and family. We want a dog that is happy to have visitors and friends over and will quickly adapt to new people.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, and this is a hard no. We live in a neighborhood and town with a lot of dogs. Our next door neighbors have a small dog, our upstairs neighbors have 2 dogs, and our other neighbors at the end have a small dog too. Along with a high dog population, a lot of people take their dogs for walks on the trails around town, which is something we would frequently do with our dog.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I do not like jumping. My in-laws boxer jumps and he is extremely rough, especially since he is so big. I would also like to avoid reactivity and resource guarding.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

On days where I am at work and my partner is sleeping after his shift, the dog would be alone for about 8 hours a day. This happens roughly 3x a week. On off days, the dog would not be alone except during errands, trips, etc. I do use a pet sitter that could come on days where the dog would be alone for excessive periods of time.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Both myself and my partner are interested in similar breeds, though he isn't as interested in the smaller dogs as I am. He would be just as involved in the dog's life as I would be. The first few months with the dog would be a bit unbalanced as I would be the one who could spend the most time training a new puppy/dog.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We currently have 3 rats, a leopard gecko, and a crested gecko. We are also planning on getting fire bellied toads in the spring/summer. In our apartment, they have their own pet room. The door is kept closed. While a dog with a low or nonexistent prey-drive is preferable, we are able to manage a dog that does have a prey drive. My dog, Bates, had a very high drive and over the 5 years of having these pets with Bates, we had 0 accidents. It's something I am experienced with and highly vigilant of.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No. We do not have children. However, we would still want a dog that is friendly and good with children so we can have our young family members over and be confident while taking the dog for walks around our neighborhood, town, and the hiking trails.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We currently rent a 2bd apartment about 1,058sqft. There are no breed or weight restrictions in our neighborhood. We plan to eventually own a home, but that is not for a few more years.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

We live in Chester County, PA. There are no laws for breed restrictions. Only private landlord restrictions, which do not apply to us.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summers are hot and humid (85F+) and winters are cold and dry (40F and below).

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We have a pet sitter that we use for long trips and there's also a lot of doggy daycares in the area. We don't really have a yard, but are within walking distance of the Schuylkill River Trail and live close to Valley Forge. There's also a dog park nearby, but would only use it sparingly for safety reasons.

First time owner getting slightly older dog - are these red flags or okay?,"I made enquiries today through a breed-specific Facebook group to try and find a slightly older dog (3-5 years) that needs a new home. I'd prefer to get a slightly older house trained dog rather than handle the puppy stage - although I suspect that dogs for rehoming will most usually have a traumatic past. 

Anyway, a breeder got in touch with me and said she has a 4 year old dog that needs homing. She shared pics and videos of the dog , in which she was petting him, he looked calm and relaxed and happy enough. The dog's circumstances are sad - so I checked if this would be a suitable homing for me as a first-time dog owner, if the dog may have behavioural issues. She didn't respond to this question. There were also a couple of other red flags which I'd appreciate thoughts on: 

-  I asked for customer testimonials and was shown cut and pasted typed references. I was told that she couldn't share contact details for me to contact any of them due myself to privacy issues.  Is this fair enough?

-One of the references mentions how sad it is that the breeder got reported to trading standards and had some of her pups taken away from her by a 'malicious' person. I checked the breeder's website and this looks legit - there is lots of support for her and she has a Go Fund Me to try and appeal the pups being taken from her - but I find it odd that the customer reference she shared mentions and defends this issue.

- the dog that needs homing went to its second  home at 6 months. All was apparently fine there until the owners divorced 16 weeks ago. since then the dog has been 'caged' for most of the day and then again at night time. It has lost much of its fur due to stress, but it is now growing back.

-the dog hasn't been neutered, and was wearing a nappy in the photo. Apparently it has weed in the house but otherwise is trained. She said it's a wise idea to put the nappy things on male dogs if you leave them at home for a bit. Is this right?

Debt Consolidation (Possibly HEL/HELOC),"I am looking for advice on consolidating debt and lowering average interest rate. I am married and our annual household income is about $110,000. Our mortgage company estimates our house at just over $400,000 and we currently owe around $235,500. The existing debt consolidation loan was used to pay off various medical debt. Credit Card 1 has been caring a balance for several years from overspending when I was younger and a few unplanned expensive, have already paid off over $4,000 on it this year. I plan on blocking Credit Card 1 and shredding it after it is paid off (I don't want to hurt my credit by canceling it). Credit Card 2's balance is from the last year or so primarily from a trip to visit family across the country (after paying it off I would block it and lock it in our document safe). The Care Credit has been used for various medical, and vet bills the last year and a half totaling aprox $4,000 that has all been paid off. I know addressing the reason for debt is always the first step which I feel we have done, and now I am just trying to consolidate and hopefully address the high interest accounts.

Debt:

Mortgage: $1,750/month at 3.625%

Credit Card 1:  Aprox $7,500 at 24.15%

Credit Card 2: Aprox $7,000 at 18%

Care Credit Card: $0

Debt Consolidation Personal Loan: $16,000 at 27.48%

Camper Trailer Loan: $24,000 at 7.0%

Mattress Firm Loan: $1,726 at 29.99%

Auto Loan: Aprox $40,700 at 7.94%

Monthly Bills (Insurance, Fuels, Utilities, etc.): Aprox $1,060

For just additional information both of our Credit Scores are in the 680-720 range.

Edit 1: I appreciate the many responses. I would say that I feel some of the advice was given after only half reading my post. I have no worries about paying off the current debt as we have already paid off over $4k of the debt this year. I also stated the current consolidation was  to pay off medical bills. Plus a large portion of the debt is from a few years ago when our income was in the $60-70k range and had lower credits hence the high rates. My goal with this was to possibly have a lower average intrest rate and overall pay less intrest.

Edit 2: Just want to summarize we have the abve debt and income. We have no issues making payments, I am just looking at options to pay less interest overall. We have a budget with not many items that aren't bills ( 1 streaming service and a gym membership) and am not looking to sell any items.",0,1731812659.0
Determining how to tackle my student/car loans as I start my first job out of college,"I'm moving across the country to start my first job out of college in a few weeks and am looking for some advice on how to tackle my budget/loans/retirement. I checked out the flowchart in the Wiki and tried to make a decent plan to tackle my finances.

**Loans (\~$43k)**

* $6k in car loan
   * 5.24% interest rate
* $37k in student loans
   * 2.75% to 3.75% for private loans
   * 2.75% to 5.5% for federal loans (mostly unsubsidized)

**Financial Situation**

* $16k currently in high-yield savings account
* $70k salary
   * $4k sign-on bonus
   * 5% to 401k to max out company match
   * $25 per paycheck to HSA

  
My current plan is to pay off my car loan (i know the interest rate is less than my larger federal loans) with some of the money I have in my HYSA, and leave the rest as an emergency fund ($10k). So that will get rid of my monthly car payment. Then, hit minimum payments on my student loans ($430 per month) which will set me up to have them paid off by 2034 :/. Then basically redirect what I was paying for my car loan to my Roth IRA (\~$250). Combining this with the budget I made, my expenses would be pretty much equal to my post-tax income. 

Given I haven't moved yet and really don't know how my budget will shape out, I'll probably hold off on contributing to my Roth for the first month or two to get a better feeling of what my budget looks like. Additionally, trying to furnish an apartment and everything that goes along with that. But ultimately, the goal would be to put any leftover money into my Roth. 

Does this plan seem like a solid way to tackle debt/retirement? I'm definitely open to any suggestions or feedback. Ultimately, I would like to pay off my loans as quickly as possible, but also realize that contributing to retirement is important. My biggest struggle is trying to figure out the best way to balance this.",0,1731689412.0
Dumb Question:  But do you essentially lose a lot of retirement money switching to a new job/401k when and over to IRA?,"So I'm not gonna give my actual numbers, but I will say I contribute the federal maximum to my 401k each year and receive a form of company match and that I've been at the same job for 10+ years.

So let's say someone works a job for 15 years and has $500k in that 401k.  They leave the job and get a new job with a new 401k.  They rollover the $500k to their IRA and start the new 401k from scratch.

But because investing has a large snowball effect, doesn't that cost them a lot down the road?

401k federal max is $23,500 plus company match, but IRA max is only $7000.

So if you'd stayed at your old job you would be adding over 3x the IRA contribution per year to the already massive 500k and would be able to snowball that harder.  But if you rollover, that 500k is now only able to receive a 7k yearly contribution without any match and your new job 401k is starting at 0.  So now your highest ""rate"" of contributing is starting with $0 to earn interest from and the IRA is gaining less interest than if you had not moved the money because you're unable to contribute as much/snowball further.

Am I completely wrong about this?  I'm not a financial genius, but I wanted to make sure I'm not missing something.  This would be a significant factor in deciding whether I end up taking a new job or not.",0,1732361095.0

Conflicted on getting another dog,"I currently have one dog (2YR Male). My mom and I dote on him a lot, but now that I've started working and doing school I'm really not home as much. My mom also works a full shift so he's pretty much by himself until I get back from school at 1 PM. Everytime I check on him via the pet cam, he looks so sad. It really breaks my heart. We live with a relative who also has two dogs (9YR Female and 2 YR Male), but the way they play with him isn't really fair or safe in my opinion. They both gang up on him at the same time and overwhelm him pretty quickly. They're also WAY bigger than him. There have never been any accidents or injuries, but I really don't think it's fair for him. 

My mom and I have been talking about getting another dog to keep him company and also she just wants another dog. However, my main concern is the amount of time and effort I'd have to put into training a dog, not to mention its double the food, double the vet bills if necessary, double the grooming bills and I'd be doing all of it myself since she wants no part in training the pup. I also don't think there would be enough space for four dogs in our house. In addition, my mom thinks the new dog should be a girl. It was already in the plans to neuter our current dog, but then we’d have to spay the girl and that’s not cheap. Our house is big, but it's very chaotic having a bunch of high energy dogs in one space. On the other hand, I do enjoy animals and I do want my dog to not feel so lonely while I'm gone. What should I do?

EDIT: Hi everyone! Thanks for your insight. I've decided not to get the second dog and have instead opted to put in more focus on improving the play dynamic between the three dogs. When I came back from work today, I decided to test something and have only the two boys play together outside while the other stayed inside. The way they played was really different from what I have observed when the nine-year old was involved. Then, I let her out to join them and the typical roughhousing started up. I'm going to put in a lot of effort in to see how I can teach her how to play a bit nicer. Thanks again everybody! ",1,1728659542.0

Switching jobs - traditional 401k to Roth conversion?,"I'm 30 years old, and I currently work for Amazon and have a traditional 401k with Fidelity (NetBenefits) with a balance of about $200k. My typical annual income is somewhere around $330k.  

I'm going to switch jobs, and next year, my income will be about $210k. The year after, because of stock vesting timelines, my income will be about $400k.  

Given my age and the fact that my taxable income will be so much lower next year, is it possible (and would it make sense) to roll my 401k into a Roth IRA? Can I do it on the entire balance, or is there a limit?",0,1732312126.0
Wondering which direction with property should be taken.,"Three and a half years ago, my wife and I bought a parcel of land in middle Vermont with a cash payment (overtime from COVID in both our jobs) that was originally valued at 100k from the seller but was knocked down to 70k due to her desperation from an imminent cross country move. 

This parcel is a very foliage-heavy secluded 5 acres with a well for water and power lines that extend all the way to the property. It lies near a ski mountain and an affluent town (about 7 miles away), and has already appreciated to about ~$150,000 based on listings for similar or smaller lots in the area. 

Obviously we appreciate the property value having gone up, and we know that property especially in a nice mountainous area should be seen as an investment, but we also are relatively financially illiterate. Would it make the most sense to continue holding onto this property or sell it for a healthy chunk of money down the line and have it grow elsewhere? 

We obviously have a vague image of ourselves retiring and building a cozy A-Frame cabin decades from now (both in our late 20s), but with an amount of money that is exponentially higher, we would be able to retire more comfortably. 

What would you recommend? ",0,1731613978.0
My reactive dog keeps escaping,"Some background info on my dog. We adopted him from the shelter at 8 months old, and he has been a bit fearful from the start, but with training and time he has gotten over most of his fears. He also has a very strong prey drive and has caught multiple rabbits, and tries to chase anything other than dogs and people, including cats. He used to be quite friendly with other dogs, but after having multiple encounters with aggressive dogs he has started to become aggressive back towards them, especially larger dogs.

Since we got him he has found new ways to escape our house/yard every time we try to fix it. He would make a hole under the fence, so we fixed those. Then he used found ways to bounce off objects and go over our fence, so we solved those. Somewhat more recently he was able to just clear the fence, so we have him on leash at all times in our yard. Today he jumped off our raised patio(which is several feet off the ground) and over our fence to escape. He also takes any opportunity he gets when someone is our household fails to completely close a door.

At nearly 5 years old, he has gotten to be quite aggressive with certain dogs and will try to escape our yard to go pick a fight with them. It has gotten to the point that I'm concerned for his safety and the safety of other pets in our neighborhood. I try really hard to make sure that he doesn't escape and he is never intentionally let off leash, but he somehow manages to find the rare opportunity when someone is forgetful.

I'm really not sure what to do to train him better or what else can be done to keep him from escaping and I could really use some advice.

Should I pay off my car loan?,"I have a 2015 Prius C with about 88k on it. I put an average of 30,000 miles a year on my car. I owe about $22k on it (a very crappy Carvana/Bridgecrest situation where I needed a new vehicle asap). I'm in a position right now where I can pay off the car completely and get out from under this terrible $528/month payment. 

A) Would that hurt my credit to close this account? My credit's already crappy. I want to increase, not decrease, that score.

B) Does it make sense to pay off this loan? I know I'm paying more than the car is worth now--but maybe better to have paid it off and start putting that monthly money toward a savings account for the next car?

I'm stumped. Dog with long quick.,"I've had my dog for years now, she's 6. She's a cocker spaniel cross cavalier. I've been trimming her nails for years - I really like it and don't get too nervous about it, I use clippers -  but she is terrified of getting her nails trimmed and through a lot of hard training I have gotten her better at sitting still for it etc. but something has always bothered me. Her long nails. Even though I trim them regularly her quicks are just so darn long. I adopted her when she was 9 months and she came from a not so great home to start her life. She must have had a bad experience with her nails and they never trimmed them again/ kept her in one room for most of her puppy stage. 

So the whole time I've had her, her nails and quicks have been long. And I just can't get them shorter. Any suggestions? I have cut her quick a couple of times over the years, which set us back. I'm worried about getting too close. Her nails are a brownish colour. All the tips online are for white nails or completely black nails. Both of which aren't helpful as I can't see the quick, but there's no ""black dot"" to look out for as her nail/ quick is a tan brown colour and pretty uniform. The only way I can tell I'm getting close to the quick is she gets super sensitive to the touch, and yelps and pulls away, quickly ending our nail session. 

I've asked the vet about it and they said, yep her quicks are quite long, and her nails sometimes peel so they recommended a better diet which we have started now. 

I know a dremel would be good. But it is just not an option. I just can't see her being ok with the vibration, the noise, it sounding her nails etc. it took us literal years to get her semi comfortable with some hair clippers. Even then she only lasts a couple of minutes. 

I've started to consider taking her to the vet again to see if they have any advice. Put her on sedatives etc.

I would love any advice or product recommendations if there's a nail file tool or something you have used and had good luck with. 

Oh and the best thing that has ever worked for us is spending a week at the beach and the sand wore down her quick on the inside and I was able to cut the hollowed nail. It was only a few mm and it grew back fairly quickly, but maybe I need another long holiday at the beach 🤔",1,1728273340.0

[BREEDS] Apartment Dog Breed Suggestions," **Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, this will not! Growing up we had labs, and I also had my own dog, a border collie/australian shepherd mix. He was my complete responsibility. It was my job to train him, take him for walks, etc. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Definitely from a breeder! But if it comes down to it, me and my partner are not opposed to rescuing. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.

* My ideal dog is anywhere from 40lbs-80lbs. A dog that can deal with hot temperatures because of where we live (up to 105°f). A dog that does not drool too much, but shedding is not a concern. A dog that is willing to stay home and relax sometimes, but can also handle and will enjoy long walks or hikes. We would also like our dog to be on the quieter side, and to get along with cats. 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My partner and I are fans of sighthounds! Specifically greyhounds and whippets. We’re drawn to them because of their temperament, exercise needs, and we like the size of whippets. We’re unsure how they would do with cats however, and greyhound breeders are difficult to find. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Simple obedience! So heel, sit, stay, down, and recall would be our main priority for training. :]

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* N/A

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* A few hours a day! 3-4 on average. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Up to two hours a day on average.  My partner and I go for walks and hikes frequently. We will not be using public dog parks, due to bad experiences with them. We’re not opposed to renting out private dog parks for a few hours a week. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Willing to do any brushing or grooming required! If we find it difficult to manage we are willing to take our dog to the groomer. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large (40lbs-80lbs). My partner is hesitant with anything over 80 pounds. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Any amount of shedding is fine. Some barking is alright, as long as it’s not barking at every little thing. As little drool as possible would be appreciated, but it’s not a complete dealbreaker. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important at all. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly all the way. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More eager to please!

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* We want the dog to be fairly outgoing, so positive responses. We do not want growling, or non stop barking. A dog that does well with strangers is preferred.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* If a dog is straight up aggressive, then no. But willing to manage a reactive dog. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Max five hours a day. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Me and my partner will split caring 50/50. Except for bathing, that’s my job. Their preferences include a dog under 80lbs, little to no drooling, and they do not want a retriever of any kind due to past experiences.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have cats! All are used to dogs and are friendly with them. :)

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Renting in the future! We’re strictly looking at apts with no weight limits for dogs. No breed limits that we’re sure of at the moment.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* United States! No banned breeds in the country or state we live in. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* (23°f — -5°c) Winter (87°f — 30.5°c) Summer

Just moved to the US. Help me decide between VT & VTI/VXUS for my long term investing. How much will I forego by picking VT?,"

Hello,

I’m 36 and currently relocated to Texas.

So I was in Canada for the past 10 years and had most of my money (~$100k) invested in a Canadian TFSA (tax free savings account) in a 2-fund portfolio of VT & BNDW (90:10).

I liquidated my TFSA and moved permanently to the US last month since I got my greencard, and these funds are now lying around in my US bank account that I need to invest immediately into my newly opened taxable brokerage (Fidelity).

Since I prefer simplicity, I was thinking of just doing 100% VT again (ditching bonds this time as many people said you don’t need bonds at this age) despite the slightly higher ER and lack of tax credits, but since I expect this amount to grow, I’m wondering if it’s still a good idea? How much money in tax credits will I be foregoing every year by doing this?

Also - a lot of people prefer overweighting US and doing 80% VTI & 20% VXUS, and I’ve personally been seeing VTI consistently outperforming VT, so I’m wondering if it’s better to go this route instead and simply allocate every new investment in a 80/20 ratio? 

What do you guys suggest? 

P.S. I don’t have an IRA/401k as of now since I don’t have a job, so this question is just geared for my taxable brokerage account.",0,1732132456.0

Books/media that have helped you through loss of pet? ,"Hello, 

My best friend, my guardian, passed away on Tuesday in my arms.

We took her to the vet, and my heart finally accepted that I would have to say goodbye there. We agreed to put her to sleep, and while the vet went out to get her equipment, she passed away on her own in my arms.

Pulling pup,"Scared Pup

Hi everyone! Calling reactive dog experts. My dog is easily scared but never violent. She is good at the start of a walk but the second we turn to go home she goes into sled dog mode. It’s like she’s in a trance. Her tail is tucked and she seems anxious rather than excited.

I feel like I’ve tried it all, treats, sitting and waiting, consistent walks (time and place), differing walks (place), a million different no pull leashes, and even more, but she will still always pull HARD. It’s at the point where we can’t possibly have anyone help with walks as she’s rather strong.

Also, there are times when the tree did rustle, it was a fairly loud rustle, slow and cumbersom as if there is a larger animal inside-then a small fruit would drop so the dog would get it. The tree does not even have any fruit on the outside also. There is very few, perhaps 3-4  on the inner branches of the tree. However, every time it did rustle, a fruit would drop for the dog.

The tree itself is not that dense, if I shine the light, I could see through the leaves. In the day time we can easily see through the tree. (It's not a large tree) I had gotten up close to it many times already but could not find anything inside. I also got a 2nd opinion that looked through the tree and found nothing.

Though if it was a squirrel, possum, or any animal in general, my dog would had already barked when it catches the smell.

In your experience, what is it inside the tree?

Thanks.",1,1726472730.0
Experience with TIAA retirement?,"I work for a school and our only retirement option is through TIAA. I know very little about investing and how it all works, but I've had my money in there for \~3 years and have only recently learned that there are different ways I can invest it. I just spent an hour on the phone with a financial consultant through TIAA to talk through whether or not I should change my plan. We ended up changing from moderate to aggressive based on the fact that I'm young (29) and have time. He sent me a summary of the new funds that my money will go to.

  
After hanging up, I was researching TIAA and read some pretty bad things about it, like that the financial consultants will guide you towards high fee funds (he didn't say anything about fees on the phone??) or plans that will just make them more money.

  
I guess my question is whether I should trust this guy I talked to and continue with the plan he set me up in, or if I should get outside advice from a financial planner? Again, I'm really uneducated about all this and even if I researched the funds, I don't know what I'm looking for. Any advice is appreciated.",0,1732210309.0
[Breeds] Thinking of adopting a dog,"**Introduction**

    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * Yes, this will be my first dog.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * I am looking to rescue a dog, and I would rather adopt an adult dog over a puppy.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * My ideal dog would be an 8-15kg, medium energy dog that is cuddly, friendly, fairly receptive to training and eager to go on walks and adventures but can be entertained inside the house as well, for days that it's just too hot to go outside. I don't mind being alerted or shedding but no excessive barking or furnadoes every other day. Basically a good city/apartment dog.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * Kokoni dogs and related mixes are my #1 choice. I've read and seen that they make good companions that are friendly, alert and receptive to training, they are super cute and they're bigger and more robust than most toy breeds. Pomeranians and papillons are two other breeds I like for similar reasons.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Basic obedience and a few fun tricks.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * No.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * About 2-4 hours a day on average, slightly more on the weekends.
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * About 1-2 hours a day I would say. 2-3 walks a day about 30-50min each, with playtime like fetch, tug and mental exercise with puzzle feeders, sniff mats, lick mats, etc. in-between. Dog parks won't be included, I'm not even sure if there are any dog parks near me. 
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * Every few days to once a week is alright with me. Yes, I am open to grooming my dog at home.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Small-to-medium size? I'm worried over how fragile toy breeds are but I don't want a huge dog either. 
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * I am okay with some shedding and barking, slobber is another story.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * Not important, I don't mind always keeping my dog on a leash.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * I would like one that's more on the snuggly side.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * More eager-to-please.
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * Ideally I would prefer a dog that responds calmly and that's friendly with visitors, but since I also live in a big city I wouldn't mind a watchdog either, so long as friends/family can safely come over.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * No.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * I would like to avoid taking a long time to potty train and general reactivity, as I live in a busy neighborhood with people, other animals and cars/bikes coming and going most of the day.
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * I am between jobs at the moment and working on finishing master's degree from home, so I'm at home all day and can devote much more time to the pup. My father's shift typically ends at around 2pm so once I'm back to work, the dog would be left alone for about 5-8 hours a day, 5 days a week. 
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * My father likes dogs and would also prefer a smaller dog, admittedly a little more on the toy dog size of things. However, he agrees we don't want a dog over ~15kg. It was my idea to get a dog so I will be the primary caretaker, and he will occasionally play with or walk the dog when he'd like to or if I can't do it due to illness etc.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * Yes, I currently have 4 pet reptiles. Two corn snakes, 1 ball python and 1 kingsnake. I will never let them interact directly or without super close supervision, as a dog can easily harm and kill them. I might like to have a cat eventually, but it's not a deal breaker if I can't.
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * No. I don't have kids or young siblings, and neither do my friends.
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * Yes, I rent. No restrictions under the contract. Under Greek law I'm pretty sure it's also illegal to evict someone if the contract doesn't explicitly state pet limitations and they have no more than 2-3 cats or dogs in an apartment, as long as their dogs/cats are all kept within their rental property, aren't left in the public or exposed areas of the building (ie. balconies, hallways, garages etc.) and don't disturb the other tenants during common quiet hours.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * Greece. Information on banned breeds is conflicting; I've seen organizations and people say there's no banned breeds, but I've also seen others say that pitbulls, rotweillers, akita and tosa inus are banned. However, I don't think there actually is a law anymore (and if there is it isn't enforced), because while I've seen tourists say they were denied entry into the country for vacation due to their dog years ago, I also see unmistakable pitbulls, rotties and akitas on my walks and in shelters now. 
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * Summers can get to 35-40 Celsius; winters close to zero.
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    * Bit the bullet and made this post to ask for advice, I've been wanting a dog since I was a kid and I've seriously thinking of adopting a dog for about a year now and I'm at a comfortable enough position now where I might be able to do it! I have even scoped out a specific dog in a shelter since the summer, but I'd like opinions if it seems like a good match for me?",1,1727352423.0
"Easily, repeatedly, and cheaply move funds from one HSA account to another?","I currently have an HSA account with Fidelity to whom my employer directly, freely, and automatically deposits an elected portion of my paycheck. I am happy with this situation. However, beginning in 2025 my employer will no longer allow direct HSA deposits to an institution of my choosing. Instead employees must open an HSA account at a particular institution where we will receive deposits. This is probably easier and cheaper for the employer. I am less happy with this situation.

Ideally I'd like every cent with his new receiving institution to be directed to Fidelity without any thought or cost to me. I know I can request a Transfer of Assets to move HSA funds between institutions as often as I'd like without incurring any tax penalties, and I did this initially when I opened my Fidelity HSA account. 1) It was manual, 2) it was slow, 3) it cost a wire fee.

Bernese Mountain Dog bullying?,"Aggression/Bullying?

I have a seven month old Bernese mountain dog. For context I’ve owned many breeds in the past, hounds, an Akita, and on. I currently have a two year old Great Dane. My friend has a Berner who is awesome and I really thought the breed would be a good fit. Again I’ve owned and trained a variety of dogs.
The Dane LOVED having the Berner puppy, playing with him watching him etc the Dane is a ball of butter. He’s very submissive and gentle, gets along with my mother’s dogs etc.
Well recently since the Berner turned 7 months he’s begun bullying the Dane. I have older dogs and so does my mother—he doesn’t do it with them. I wouldn’t worry about them establishing a pecking order, but the Berner growls at the Dane over toys (unclaimed etc) and if there’s no toys to do it with he kicks the Dane off his bed etc. sometimes he’ll grab a toy and walk purposely up to the Dane then snarl.
Obviously I redirect and work with it, but the Danes feelings are hurt and the Berner will pull it the moment I turn my back. 
Honestly this is behavior I totally would expect out of a ‘dominant’ breed like the Akita or even a Ridge back or Italian Mastiff. But it shocks me out of a Berner. Is this a ‘thing’ with them that passes as they grow? Or is this just his personality that I’m dealing with? I’ve never met a Berner that sneakily aggressive it really surprised me.

Redistributing from Brokerage to IRA / 401(k),"Before joining this sub I opened a fidelity brokerage account and placed $4,500 into ETFS.

After reading the Wiki I realized I should have placed that money into a Roth IRA.

Additionally, once I have maxed my Roth IRA, would it make more sense to use a backdoor Roth IRA or contribute a larger percentage to my 401k? In what case should I be contributing to a brokerage account?

Would it be a bad move to purchase a home in this financial situation?,"My significant other and I are in our early 30s and have been considering purchasing our first home but we are very unsure as to how to gauge what would be considered affordable without becoming house poor.

We live in a high cost of living state (Hawaii) and have been renting the same place since mid 2020.

Current rent: $1800 + Electric (\~$200)  + Gas stove (\~$40) + Water (\~$80). In terms of rent, it is a very good deal, everything nearby for rent for a similar space and size is easily 2.2k+ at the minimum. Since mid 2020 our rent has only gone up $50/month with the addition of paying for water which we originally weren't. Landlord is great, they are aware we are planning to look for a home and are willing to keep rent the same and roll month to month if we decide to sign/renew a 6 month lease (December - May).

We by chance happened to see a listing for a new build for a home \~$985,000 which is to be finished by the end of the year which includes up to $40,000 in closing costs on the sellers end. Median single family homes here are \~1.1 million and condos \~520k.

Pre-approval for a loan was completed and the estimated rate is ""6.125% at 3.125 points"" after buying down w/ the remaining closing costs. Estimated monthly payments of $5,420 (Principal & Interest $4800, Hazard insurance $150, Real estate taxes $285, HOA $186).

Combined yearly income of \~225k (\~120k + \~105k). Planning to split 50 / 50 for everything.  
Combined \~$11,900 per month after taxes & 403b, but Person 1 only contributing 3% to 403b and Person 2 only contributing 5% to 403b (3% match for both of us).  
Combined $380k in HYSA, \~80k in roth IRA, \~100k in 403b.

Job security is stable. No current health issues. No student loans or debts aside from recurring monthly bills (phone, car insurance, roth IRA contributions, netflix, HBOmax, spotify, amazon prime). Planning to have children in \~2 years.

We are on the fence on committing and worried about ending up house poor in the future after having kids / as HOA fees rise / unsure if we are contributing enough to our 403b to be secure into retirement. We have heard about 0.28 DTI (pre-tax income?) and 50 / 30 / 20 rules (post-tax income?) but am not sure if there are other ways to gauge this situation and would really appreciate some advice or guidance. We have only gone to this one home and haven't checked out / given a chance to looking at other properties which feels silly for such a major life decision. It is likely we end up purchasing a used home/condo if we don't secure this place as there aren't any new developments nearby in the upcoming year. It's just more so that this offer to cover closing costs and it being the last model of it's release left puts the pressure on. This development plans to make a mix of condos/townhouses/homes over the next 9 years but there is no official word of which order/timing of releases.



TLDR;

$985,000 new build home w/ $40,000 closing costs covered on sellers send.  
Planned down payment of 20% (\~200k).   
Loan: ""6.125% at 3.125 points"" after buying down w/ remaining closing costs.  
Estimated monthly payments of $5,420 (principal/interest, hazard insurance, real estate taxes, HOA) before utilities.

Combined yearly income: \~225k  
Combined \~$11,900 per month after taxes & 403b, but Person 1 only contributing 3% to 403b and Person 2 only contributing 5% to 403b (3% match for both of us).  
Combined $380k in HYSA, \~80k in roth IRA (maxed yearly), \~100k in 403b (Person 1 invests 3%, Person 2 invests 5%).

No major debts / loans. Planning to have children in \~2 years. Worried about ending up house poor / costs of children in the future / if we're not currently contributing enough to retire safely and would really appreciate advice or guidance. Thank you so much.",0,1731860752.0
"My first foster has been adopted, and I am in heaven ","Hi !
I had no idea which flair to put... I am sorry.

In 14 february I had my first foster ! A bearded border collie, a breeder made too much puppies and couldn't get right of 16 of them... so he gave them to an organisation. They passed their first years in a container, only with dog, surrounded by dog. Never touched, nothing. They travelled 3 days, and he came to me.

7/8 months of work ! Making him discover the world, teaching him the language of human... the gear, potty training etc. It was also kinda fun, because he only knew border collie... other breed would scare him a bit !

He left mid September. The family dreamed about a dog they could take him to their job at clients houses, walking him off leash, going to big walk, travelling with it, that goes along with their cat,etc. Aaaand I am so proud of my foster, because, he is realizing their dream.
He had so much hard time with human, and now ?? He loves going to work, he loves meeting new people, and even be happy when he meet new human !! 
They walk him off leash In the village ( it's in the French country side ) !
I am so happy, because all the hard work paid off, and because they are so happy !

Does anyone have a good weighting method for paying off multiple 0% interest loans?,"I'll try to explain, bear with me...

So let's say I have 3 large PayPal credit purchases, all of which are 0% interest if payed off within 6 months. 

Purchase 1: $20 / 1 month left to pay.

Purchase 2: $300 / 3 months left to pay.

Purchase 3: $1500 / 6 months left to pay.

Typically my payment for the next month would be the sum of all payments divided by the months to pay left.

Is whole life insurance worth it?,"30F with no dependents and not consider dependent honestly until close to 35 if ever. 10k left on auto loan. 20k in HYSA. 350k in student loans from private grad school.

Advice for brain-stimulating toys for dogs with very small mouths and missing teeth?,"We have the smartest, most athletic, sweetest little mutt, and I'm worried that we aren't mentally stimulating him enough.

* smart dog - takes him about half an hour to learn anything
* small mouth with low tooth density - all we know about him is that he's a chihuahua mix, so little face and mouth

What to do with inheritance,"So I’m 49 and my wife is 50 and we plan to retire at 67. Recently I’ve inherited a low 6 figure sum.

My first big move was investing $10k ($5k cash and $5k loan) into MKB, which turned into $80k. I reinvested it all into VGW, which also delivered solid profits. That said, I’ve taken big risks and lost a lot on other projects and investments.

Here’s where I currently stand:
Portfolio ($AUD)

	•	Shares: $2M

	•	Property: $3.5M (2 investment properties + 1 primary residence)

	•	Crypto: $250k (BTC, ETH, SOL)

	•	Debt: $2M (property-related)

	•	Other possessions: $200k

Cashflow
	

•	Business: $250k revenue annually (engineering products and services)

	•	Dividends: $150k annually


I’ve got about $300k cash on hand, and I’m wondering where to go from here. I know I’m in a unique position, thanks to taking big risks—some paid off, some didn’t.

I’m considering a few options:

	•	Buying a developmental property or commercial property.

	•	Focusing more on scaling my business.

	•	Diversifying into something entirely new.

I’d love to hear from anyone with experience in a similar position or anyone who can offer strategic advice for this next chapter. How would you approach growth or diversification at this stage?

Balance Transfer to Citi Double Cash Card?,"Hi r/personalFinance,

Complete Credit Card and Personal Finance newbie here. I’m working on getting my finances in order after making some less-than-ideal decisions in the past and would love some advice.

I currently have a Discover Card with a remaining balance of about $1,000, which I’ve been slowly paying off for a while. Credit Karma recently suggested I do a balance transfer to a Citi Double Cash Card that offers 0% APR for 18 months. My credit score is solid (FICO 687, Vantage 700), and my original plan was to pay off the balance using my 2025 tax return.

Would a balance transfer be a smart move in this situation or should I stay the course?",0,1732119556.0

Negative Environmental Impact of Roth IRAs,"Hey everyone, I need some advice! 

I'm planning (or was planning) on opening a Roth IRA to start saving a serious amount of money for my future. However, on top of already feeling guilty about the negative environmental impact of my current bank accounts (because these big banks are all propping up the fossil fuel industry and in turn, the climate crisis), I learned that the best banks to open a Roth with are also heavy investors in the fossil fuel industry. 

The less environmentally harmful Roth accounts will see little return, so from what I can tell, my options are to either:

A. Open a Roth IRA with a company like Fidelity or Schwab and have my personal funds perpetuating the climate crisis

B. Open a Roth with a ""green"" bank who doesn't invest in fossil fuels, but potentially see little to no return by the time I retire. 

I was wondering if anyone has navigated this and has any advice! ",0,1732297363.0

Looking for Recommendations for My Next Dog - Need Advice!,"1) \*\*Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\*\*

- No, I’ve previously owned a Jack Russell Terrier mix. I trained and raised him for several years, and he was well-behaved, active, and smart. I took him hiking, camping, to the beach, and even played soccer and volleyball with him.

2) \*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?\*\*

- I'm open to either, but I prefer a reputable breeder as I want to ensure a healthy dog with a predictable temperament.

3) \*\*Describe your ideal dog.\*\*

- I’m looking for an active, sporty dog that doesn’t bark excessively, is a good watchdog, but also playful and goofy. They should be smart, easy to train, and capable of handling some alone time while I’m at work. Ideally, the dog will have a good balance of energy and cuddle time and be good with other dogs as I may get a second dog in the future.

4) \*\*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\*\*

- I’m interested in medium-to-large breeds that are active but manageable in a city townhouse. I’m considering another Jack Russell Terrier, but I’m also open to breeds that match my lifestyle (active, trainable, and playful).

5) \*\*What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\*\*

- Basic commands (sit, stay, come, etc.), good leash manners, recall for off-leash activities, and possibly agility training. I'd also like them to be comfortable with hiking, camping, and possibly playing sports with me.

6) \*\*Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\*\*

- I’d love to do agility or obedience for fun, but I have no formal experience with these sports. My main focus is on an active lifestyle and a strong bond with my dog.



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) \*\*How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\*\*

- I plan to spend at least 1-2 hours daily interacting with my dog through training, playtime, and walks. Weekends will usually involve more outdoor activities like hikes or trips to the beach or park.

8) \*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly, and does that include using a dog park?\*\*

- On average, I can devote about 1 hour to two of exercise per day during the workweek. This will include walks, running in the park, and visits to the dog park. On weekends, I’d love to do more strenuous activities like hiking or beach trips.

9) \*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\*

- I prefer a dog that doesn’t require too much grooming. I’m okay with basic brushing and ear cleaning but would prefer less grooming overall. I’d rather not have a high-maintenance dog but am willing to pay for occasional professional grooming if necessary.

10) \*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\*

- Medium-to-large size, ideally around 20-90 pounds.

11) \*\*How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\*\*

- I’d like minimal shedding and slobber, but I can handle a moderate amount of barking, as long as it’s not excessive. Less grooming and drooling is preferred.

12) \*\*How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\*

- Fairly important. I would like my dog to be well-trained with recall so I can let them off-leash in safe, unfenced areas like parks or trails.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) \*\*Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\*\*

- I prefer a dog that enjoys cuddling but can also be independent when needed.

14) \*\*Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?\*\*

- A balance of both. I’d like a dog that’s eager to please when training but can entertain itself when I’m busy.

15) \*\*How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?\*\*

- I’d like the dog to alert me with a bark if someone is at the door but settle down quickly. I’d prefer a friendly or neutral greeting with visitors, nothing too aggressive or overly excitable.

16) \*\*Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\*\*

- I’d prefer a dog that is good with other dogs, as I may adopt another dog in the future. Aggression would be a challenge I’d rather avoid.

17) \*\*Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?\*\*

- Excessive barking, aggression towards other dogs or people, and any destructive behavior when left alone would be deal-breakers.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) \*\*How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\*\*

- I work in an office 4 days a week for about 8 hours a day or less. On those days, the dog would need to stay home for that period but should have sufficient exercise before and after work.

19) \*\*What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house, and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?\*\*

- I live alone for now, so all dog care will be my responsibility.

20) \*\*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?\*\*

- I don’t have any other pets currently, but I may get another dog (possibly another Jack Russell) in the future.

21) \*\*Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\*\*

- No, I don’t have kids, and the dog won’t be regularly interacting with children.

22) \*\*Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\*\*

- I live in a townhouse I own, so there are no breed or weight restrictions.

23) \*\*What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\*\*

- I live in a city in the U.S.East coast. There aren’t any breed-specific bans that I’m aware of.

24) \*\*What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\*\*

- Summers can get quite hot, around 85-95°F (29-35°C), and winters can be cold, ranging from 30-40°F (0-5°C).

---

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) \*\*Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.\*\*

- I’m looking for a dog that can handle being indoors when the weather is too extreme but is also excited for outdoor activities when the weather permits. I also want a dog with good overall health and longevity, with fewer grooming needs.

26) \*\*Feel free to ask any questions below.\*\*

- Are there any breeds that come to mind with the traits I’m looking for?

Help with dog pooping inside,"I recently moved in with my boyfriend, his two kids and his 3 year old Shiloh Shepard female dog Lilith. 

Before I moved in my boyfriend would drop the kids off at school at 9am and wouldn’t be home from work till around 6:30pm. Lilith would be fine and rarely had accidents inside the house. I’ve been moved in since the middle of October but my partner and I have been dating since the beginning of this year so I’ve spent a lot of time around Lilith and we love each other. 

In the past 7 days she’s pooped in the house 4 times, mostly in his daughter’s room but today was our bedroom. The bedrooms are carpeted and I know once the scent seeps in it becomes a chosen spot for the pet to poop but I am constantly letting Lilith in and out during the day. 

She also is bad about going to the bathroom outside, most of the time she wont pee unless someone’s out there with her but my partner and I both smoke so majority of the time she has one of us with her. 

How do I get her to stop pooping inside the house and get her properly potty trained to go outside. Any help is appreciated. ",1,1730321918.0

Buying from Findmypuppies.com,I am currently talking to this woman who claims to be a middle man between the seller and the breeder. She says she works with mostly amish family’s in the Ohio area and she helps sell their litter of puppies. I found this breeder on AKC marketplace and contacted them through there. I left my number on the message and they messaged me back via text. We have been texting about the purchase of the puppy and have even spoke on the phone together. However over text she sent me a link to https://findmynewpuppy.com/breeder/603d4a179dfd2. The puppies are listed up on that website as well. She has sent me multiple pictures and even a video of the puppy and its parents. In every picture they all have the same color collar and even the same background. Over the phone she assured me the puppies have a health guarantee up to a year for genetic issues. She even said they would be microchipped and vaccinated.

\* A few hours, not every day.  I also have family nearby who can stop in and visit when I’m gone.

Dogs climbing fences and digging.,I have a very large yard that we spent thousands on a fence. It's chain link. I have 2 dogs who are primarily outside dogs(it's what they prefer). I have a mom and her son. It started with digging from the mom and now the son is climbing over the fence. I don't even know what to do. I got wire to lay down so they can't dig but the climbing? I can't keep spending money on this fence I just don't have it like that. I spend lots of time with them bringing them on walks and stuff but yet they always want to get out. I've considered rehoming but I don't want to do that at all they are family. But they can't keep getting out it's dangerous.

“How”to save for a house?,"So I’m finally at a place where my current financial situation is making sense and I can increase saving allocation and all of that. With that being said, I’ve been thinking about it buying a house in a medium-term. Now given all 2 synapses that fire when I think about the house buying process, my question is how do you save for one? The actual process? Is the stock market the better option even tho it might fluctuate within 4-5 years? High yield savings account so its liquid but also maximizes interest? Keep it all in cash in a shoe box under the bed? 

This is more of a question of maximizing and any advice that people with more experience have with buying homes is appreciated. I am doing research on the process so I know what kind of down payment or loan I need but I’m still very new",0,1731943956.0
Good Puzzle Toys for Tiny Chihuahua ,"Hey guys! 

We just picked up a little two year old Chihuahua from the shelter. He knows nothing, but seems to be way more toy motivated then food, and  the smallest Kong I can get is too small and he's picky about food and treats in general. 

Anyone have some great puzzle toys for a 5lb dog? He loves squeaky and crinkle toys so far, but even the small ones I got are too big for him to squeak on his own.

Any other tips for a toy motivated dog are also welcome!",1,1729124929.0
nervous about asking for a raise,"I've worked at my job for about 5/6 months now. I am a visual merchandiser at a furniture store. 
In a week the store I work at will be taken over and franchised by another group. 
When this happens, we will get new insurance (Keizer 😩) and my job role will change to being in charge of merchandising for two stores. 
I've asked about a raise, and they said that they would look into it 90 days after the takeover. However, they've let some people go, and have cut corners in other places and I know they can afford it, they're a big company. 
Our insurance will also be more expensive. I don't make that much money now, but I'd really like a raise before I start taking more responsibility. 
I guess my question is how do I be adamant that I need to be paid more? I am not used to doing this. I'm nervous because they already said they would do a 90 day period. 
I guess I just need to hype myself up more, I guess I can't get in trouble for advocating for myself right? 🤪",0,1732131127.0

He was/is my best friend, he saved my life from falling into addiction, and now I am lost.

I miss him dearly, and I don't know if I can keep doing on without him.

I can't sleep, everytime I close my eyes I see him laying there looking at me while the medication started to work, and I was one of the last people he saw.

All I can seem to think about is all the times I didn't have time to be with him and all the times I told him to not beg for food, or the times where he wanted to go on a walk, but I needed to do something first... I just feel like I let my best friend down.",1,1728595963.0

Is rebalancing a portfolio worth it if you have to incur capital gains taxes to do so?  ,"Hey folks. Over the past four years I've accumulated a pretty outsized position in my employer's stock due to being granted RSUs, participating in my company's employee stock purchase program, and then the stock price appreciating much faster than I had expected. I didn't intend for it to get this out of hand, but the current breakdown is:    
    
Majority of portfolio:   
68% Employer stock  ($167,000 unrealized gain, $304,000 total value) 

Remainder of portfolio:   
32% VOO, VOOG, and various other small positions in individual companies.  

My question is: is it really worth incurring the 15% capital gains tax on a $167,000 gain just to rebalance the portfolio? I want to get the employer stock position down to the recommended 5-10% and reinvest into an S&P500 or Total US Market index fund, but I don't see a way to do that without paying through the nose in taxes. 

I understand the importance of diversification, but does it actually make sense to pay close to $30,000 in taxes to accomplish this? For instance, let's say the company stock takes a 10% hit. Well, that would also be in the neighborhood of a $30,000 loss, but it's only a loss on paper. In other words, I wouldn't have to pay anything out of pocket to the IRS. On the other hand, actively rebalancing the portfolio would mean I'd owe taxes next year and would have to find a way to come up with that money out of pocket. 

Thoughts? Anything obvious I am missing? I really want a more moderate risk portfolio, but I'm suffering from some sticker shock at the price tag of doing this. Maybe I just need to look at this from a different perspective. ",0,1732490234.0
Am I overthinking this? ,"I’m 31 years old and plan to retire between the ages of 55 and 60. I would like to retire earlier, but I’m not sure if it will be possible. Currently, I rent and do not own a home or any rental properties. I’m trying to save for a home. I earn about $60,000 annually pre-tax, and my wife earns $29,000 annually post-tax. Together, we take home approximately $3,000–$3,200 per month. We live in Georgia.

I contribute 15% of my paycheck to a 401(k) biweekly, and my employer provides a 6% company match. My total retirement savings currently sit at $66,000: $9,000 in a Roth IRA and $56,000 in my 401(k), which is a Roth 401(k). My wife has about $3,000 in a Roth IRA, and that’s her only retirement account. We try to max out our Roth IRAs each year, but it’s sometimes challenging. Depending on the year, we might contribute $3,000, $5,000, or $7,000 in total.

My wife drives a 2023 Toyota Corolla with 26,000 miles on it, which is fully paid off. I drive a 2024 Corolla Hybrid with 13,000 miles. I could pay it off today, but that would leave us with only $6,000 in our bank account. We are prioritizing building our savings to $10,000 before paying off the car. Once my car is fully paid off, we’ll be debt-free and able to save aggressively for a home.

If all goes as planned, I’ll become a registered nurse in 2025, and my wife plans to enroll in dental hygienist school that same year.

My main concern is whether my investments are on track. Am I balanced enough? Are my fund choices the best available? What would you do differently? I’m 31 and feel worried that I haven’t yet reached the $100,000 mark in retirement savings.

Below is the list of investment options available for my 401(k):

1.	S&P 500 Index – 80% contribution per paycheck
2.	US Large Cap Equity
3.	FID EXTD MKT IDX
4.	US SM MID CAP EQUITY
5.	INTERNATIONAL EQUITY
6.	SS GACEQ EXUS IDX II – 5% contribution per paycheck
7–19. TRP RETIRE Funds (2005–2065, various dates)
7.	VANG RET SAV TR IV
8.	FID US BOND IDX
9.	FIXED INCOME FUND
10.	BROKERAGELINK

    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * A younger dog so that I can introduce them to my 4 cats. A dog with a bark that does not have a pitch that will exacerbate my husband's headache sensitivity. He can handle dogs that are LOUD, just not ""ear piercing."" He does not mind a doog that Boofs, Bays, or Howls. For example, he is not bothered by a Basset's how or a Newfie's Boof. But Angelo's bark was blood-curdling to him.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * The Basset Hound, the Shar-Pei, the Sheltie, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel - as so far these are dogs I KNOW have calls/barks that don't hurt my husband's ears.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * 
    1: Know the phrase ""GIT-TH'CAT"" to stop my cat Pancake from clawing furniture. Angelo/Emily would not chase their respective cats, just huff and ""step up"" to startle them away from the furniture.
    2: Ringing The Bell - my sister taught her dog to ring a bell at the front door to let her know when he needs to go out and pee/poo. I'd like to train my dog to do that.

    * In a friendly manner, tail wagging. Barking is fine, again as long as it's not piercing it doesn't bother my husband and no barking has ever bothered me. I encouraged noise, honestly. I like ""having conversations"" with my dogs, and I got a siamese cat specifically because they're ""chatty.""

Laid off: What to do with 401k?,"My wife was laid off and we don't know what to do about her 401k?

**BACKGROUND:**  

We're in our mid/late 50's and we were hoping she'd be able to retire in 2-3 years (I'll keep working for another 10 years or so).  Obviously with her income going from pretty decent to zero puts a wrinkle in the plans as we just don't have enough saved and living solely off my income will be tight but possibly doable (I'm self employed, so I don't have a 401k or pension).

Besides the modest size 401k, we both have an IRA that we opened 3 years ago (1 is pre-tax, one is post-tax = because we had no clue what we were doing).  The IRAs have preformed amazingly well, but even so, the total dollar amount isn't huge (the contribution's were capped, and there has only been 3 years of contributions, though at our ages I think we put in a little more than someone younger could have).

We have a pretty low COL and aren't material/money driven (which is good in that we don't need a ton of money to live on, but bad in that we don't have a ton saved up either).  With our ""retirement funds"" (401k + IRAs + Savings) I estimate that we currently have about half of what we need to get by on in retirement.  

Our plan had been for both of us to continue working and to continue to max 401k and IRA contributions for 2-3 more years (at which point we'd hoped to have our house paid off and our kids be financially self sufficient).  Then she'd retire and we'd live off my income for another 7-8 years until we both hit 65, with the hope/thinking that that money saved would grow some over those years without us having to put more into it (thus giving us a much more comfortable retirement, especially if it came close to doubling over those years).  But now with her income zero, it changes things. 

I'll also note that at her age she doesn't want (nor does she think she can get) a corporate job like she had, and ideally would like a fairly ""low stakes"" position (part time would be ideal to try out partial retirement, but we may need her to work full time just to gain access to healthcare) and thus likely she will be making about half of what she used to.  Month to month that should be OK (assuming Obamacare isn't too expensive if she doesn't get a full time job) but it will limit (to zero?) how much we can support the kids and likely we won't be able to add any to our retirement funds.

**QUESTIONS:**

1. Do we leave the 401k where it's at (and I assume pay the company some sort of management fee)?
2. Do we move it to one of our IRAs?  And if so, do we have a choice of which one?  (I think hers is the post-tax one but I'd have to double check)
3. If we have a choice, is Fidelity or Charles Schwab a better choice?  (my IRA is at Fidelity, hers is at Schwab)
4. For years we've maintained keeping 6 months of living money in a savings account (with crap yield, but it's our safety net/emergency fund).  With the upcoming year and all the unknowns, we're unsure if digging into that to make IRA contributions is something we're comfortable with, so likely won't contribute anything.  Is that dumb?  Our kids are both fairly recent college grads with low paying jobs and we still help them financially a decent amount.  1 lives in a MCOL area and is pretty close to being able to live off her own income, but the other is on the East coast in a HCOL area and she doesn't make much more than minimum wage (plus she's applying to grad schools, so her expenses may go way up while her income goes down some).
5. Sort of related:  At what age do parents stop helping their children financially?  Neither of our parents helped us at all past 18, but we're trying to help our kids avoid the struggles we went through.  Our plan has always been to help as much as we can (which was a decent amount) up until they're 26 (and forced off our health insurance, which seemed like a good age to plant the flag at).  We don't want them stressing about our finances, nor do we want them to get into a pinch and us not be able to help them.  So how do (decent) parents handle the financial ""separation""?

We've got about 647 more questions, but at the moment those are the ones we feel the most worried about.

Thanks and I appreciate any/all advice!

Need help understanding roth conversions and pro rata rule,"I have an employer 401(k) with pre-tax and post-tax money. For simplicity, let's say $2m pre-tax and $1m post-tax.

I follow all rules and regulations with my dog, so nowhere that it isn’t fully legal for her to be there. I clean up after her, she has a bomb-proof recall and doesn’t chase wildlife. So legal off-leash areas would be welcome recommendations as well. 

She loves beaches and hikes, but is not a super high energy dog, she can do around 5 miles, but then wants to sleep the rest of the day and will not go on another long walk. Usually I hike or do other activities with her in the morning and then leave her in the hotel for late-afternoon and evening so she can get her much-loved nap, while I explore the area on my own. 

Some boundaries 

No national parks (these really aren’t dog friendly and dogs just aren’t meant to be here)

No small dog parks. She doesn’t enjoy the company of other dogs, though she tolerates them, she prefers to ignore them.

Free Bot/Ai to record my expenses? ,"Hello, I am in the need of an app or website or anything to record my expenses on a daily basis.

Employer Payroll Not Allowing Me to Reduce My Tax Withholdings By Any Meaningful Amount,"Hi all, I am planning on filing Ch 7 Bankruptcy in Jan or Feb 2025, and my attorney advised me to reduce my tax withholdings as much as possible, because the trustee can take possession of my tax refund as an asset come April tax refund time (for what its worth, my federal tax refund last year was around $2400 and my state refund was around $1200). In other words, I want to have as close to zero tax refund as possible, because the bankruptcy trustee will be able to take it from me. 

My current paycheck withholding is $934 federal and $240 state. Via my employer's online payroll portal, I submitted a new W-4 which literally reduced both federal and state tax withholdings to 0. (Given I only had 4 paychecks left this year when I did this 2 weeks ago, I felt I needed to reduce the withholdings to as close to 0 as possible), in order to align with the estimated total $3600 refund.

However, the paycheck I got this last Friday only had like $10 less withheld! How is it possible to collectively reduce federal and state taxes by $1170, but only had $10 reduction withheld in my paycheck?

I chatted with my employer payroll and they said that my marital status and # of dependents can impact how much the company can legally reduce the withholding for me. FYI I am single and have 0 dependents.

Can anyone shed some light on this and help me out? I want to be confident in my company's payroll, but I feel like they may not know what they are doing.

If I am single and have 0 dependents - and my W-4 is otherwise ""normal"" with no exemptions or anything, is it normal for it to basically be impossible to get any withholding reduction more than a negligible amount (ex. $10....?)

Breed Specific Reactive Dog,"Hey all! 

Just want some advice and also some people's opinions on my friends dog that I am pet sitting.

TLDR: How can I train my dog to be less reactive to specific breeds and was I in the wrong for having a reactive dog on leash in a dog park. 

My friends dog is a cattle cross (maybe lab or staffie. He has a big head!) and he's a pretty chill boy. They think he might have been a street dog because he had pretty bad teeth and is very protective of his food. 

He's very chill most of the time except! when he comes across Rottys or Golden Retrievers. He gets that look in his eyes when they come close and he'll start to bark and jump around. He's not aggressive at that stage, no hackles or snarling, but if they get too close for too long he'll get pretty aggro; snarling, aggressive barking and some lunging. 

My first question is if there is anything I can do to help ease the anxiety he feels around these types of dogs? Any other breed he's very happy to sniff and be sniffed and doesn't really react unless someone tries to hump him (fair imo haha).

Second question is one around etiquette. I went to an off leash dog park with my JRT and the cattle-cross. I keep him on lead because he's not mine and I don't trust his recall entirely. 

Today at the dog park a rotty ran over quite suddenly and I immediately walked in the other direction. It startled the cattle-cross and they immediately started snarling and snapping at each other (and my JRT joined in to stand up for the cattle-cross which warms my heart to see them protect each other but didn't help ease the situation 😂)

The owner of the rotty was pretty aggressive and yelled at me that the cattle-cross was too aggressive and that it shouldn't be in the dog park. I replied that my dog was on a leash and that his dog ran over. He said that ""that's on you. I can't stop my dog from running over"". 

I'm pretty sure one of the rules off leash is to be able to control your dog but I also appreciate that my cattle-cross is very reactive. Was I in the wrong?

Quick question about FSA funding/reimbursement,"Treat me with kid gloves, I am a moron.

I have to get some dental work done in April. My dental insurance barely covers anything, so it's going to be around 5-6k.

It just so happens my open enrollment period for funding an FSA for next year is right now. My job uses Sentinel benefits. The maximum amount I can contribute is $3,300. I'd obviously want to contribute the maximum, this gets broken into paychecks, so 126.92 comes out of my biweekly pre-tax earnings.

I've never used an FSA before, but I know you lose any unspent money at the end of the year. The procedure I need to get done is in April, so I would have only accumulated around 1.1k in the FSA by then. It looks like I need to submit a reimbursement form to Sentinel to get medical expenses covered - so would I just pay for this procedure out of pocket, then wait until the end of the year to submit for a reimbursement?

Unwinding Large Investment in Single Stock (Retired 72M & 72F),"Not sure if this belongs here, r/investing, r/personalfinance, or r/retirement

  
I retired 2 years ago at 70 and sold my small business for 7 figures.  I hold a 4% note and am collecting 10% of gross revenue (around 100k per year), the bulk of which is categorized as LTCG.  

For reasons I won't go into, my IRA with Schwab was not funded over past 2 decades the way it should have been, so I am currently sitting on 'only' about $450K in that account.  I was too busy running the business and spending earnings to think about retirement and investment strategies (belatedly remedied by reading r/bogleheads etc.)  

About 8 years ago I took some investing 'play money' and bought quite a bit of TSLA.  That stock is in an after-tax investment account and is worth, as of today, right at $680,000. 

My quandary is this:  How do I unwind from that single stock so I can move the money into bonds and index funds to pad my retirement income?  Clearly, holding such a large percentage of my net worth  ($2.8M) in a single stock is extremely risky.  Obviously, I could just bite the bullet and sell the bulk of the stock, either all at once or over months/years, but would pay 20% capital gains on the sale.  And that would also put me in a high tax bracket as well as affect things like social security IRMMA.

"If I have an older HSA and a newer, higher-balance HSA, can I consolidate them and reimburse myself for medical expenses that occured before I opened the newer HSA?

"Doing some home renovations - is an HFS loan, 401k loan, or selling stock a better option?","Hello everyone -

I've got a home repair and renovation in progress that's grown a bit in scope, and I will need a bit of cash to cover the difference. I could use some advice looking at my current options, or any other suggestions ya'll may have. 

Estimated cash shortage: $35-50,000 

Resources:

- Employer stock - $32k (but need to wait for a selling window to touch, which is a few months out)
- Market accounts/Misc stocks - $370k
- Emergency Cash fund: $10k 

Retirement:

- 401k - $94k
- Roth IRA- $49k
- Previous employer IRA - $102k

Loan Options

- 401k loan - up to $47k at 9%, 12-60 month terms.  
- HFS - 9.24% for up to $100k, 30 year term, plus loan origination fees. 
- Home Equity of about 20% on a $670k house, has not been leveraged. 

Income
 
- Monthly Household take home pay $14,500
- Monthly expenses $9,500

Our cash flow is very positive, and I expect we'll be able to pay back any loan we take out pretty comfortably over the course of the next few years without major changes. What I'm trying to weigh is that it feels foolish to take out loans at 9% when I have market resources I can sell to cover the costs, but I'm up about 22% in the market overall for prior year.

As from what they told me their loan apr is around 20% . I really want to help them but even when I cosign to refinance we can’t get the full amount refinanced (still owe about 16-17k local CU would only loan out 10.5k @ 5% APR $300-$400 monthly payments for 36 mos.) 

They threw in the idea of taking that loan from that local CU and using their credit card to cover the rest (14%) but I’m not sure it would be a great idea to do that. 

My credit score is 778 but not that much history and longest account has only been open for 3 years. No debt, just finished paying off a car loan.

Their credit score is 630.",0,1732023049.0
Things to do for my Dog ,"I took my dog yesterday to the vet because he was walking and sitting weird, didn't want to go on walks. They did X-rays. Ruled out hip issues, has slight arthritis in his back knees and a possible pinched nerve in his spine. They were sent to a radiologist so we will know tomorrow. But in the meantime vet prescribed him muscle relaxers and a steroid for inflammation. He said no jumping, running or walking but now my dog seems restless because I've had him take it easy for about a week and half with no real exercise. He's used to being very active and getting tired out. Now he's just acting like he wants to play and can't sit still. It's kind of annoying, I know it's because he has so much energy built up but is supposed to take it easy. What can I do to help him?  I use his Kong toys but seems like he is getting bored of them. He can play sniffing games but I'm not sure he can be moving around the house ",1,1728835438.0
Defaulting on a 401k loan,"How bad would it be to default on a 401k loan? For reference, I live in Connecticut. I understand the 10% early withdrawal fee when tax season comes around. It’s also my understanding that the loan will default and continue to accrue interest, which will only affect my ability to take out a loan in the future. When time comes to withdrawal for retirement, I will not owe the loan amount or interest accumulated. 

Are those the only penalties? It’s not reported to credit bureaus etc. or they will not come after me for full amount suddenly in 6 months? 

I understand it’s not ideal but unfortunately life put me in a situation I can no longer afford to make the payments.

I’m leaving on holidays without my dog - and it’s breaking my heart 😢,"I'm about to leave for a week abroad without my dog... he stays at home with my flatmate, who knows him very well and who loves him a lot... but it still breaks my heart... for the past couple of days, I've been nervous and sad... 

He's generally well behaved but comes with a few ""special instructions"" and I just worry a lot about - everything...

I know it's only a short week, and it will be great to also have a break from walking and caring for him... but he's my best friend and I just feel so sad to be separated from him for a week...

Received lien termination notice on a vehicle that we owe $28k on,"As the title states, my fiance and I received this letter in the mail:

TERMINATION STATEMENT
I hereby certify that DIVERSIFIED MEMBERS CREDIT UNION, formerly doing business as Detroit Metropolitan CU, Detroit
Municipal CU, CSE Credit Union, Clawson Community Credit Union, Clawson Financial and Iron Workers Local 25 CU, holds no further interest in the vehicle described below.
The lien has been satisfied.
PLEASE ATTACH THIS TO YOUR TITLE

It has all of our vehicle info, is signed and dated. It was sent with the title. 

We have never had a car loan before this, so is this something banks tend to do? Our online statement very obviously still says we owe, but it has our payments due reduced by half of what they were previously. What gives?

We sat on hold for an hour today and decided to just call back on Monday.

I just feel like it’s such an odd time to receive this, just a little over half of our loan has been paid off. Our payments were incredibly high, at $950 a month and now they appear to be sliced in half. Why would they release a lien on a vehicle that has a large amount that still needs paid? And reduce the payments?

Edit: we were finally able to get through to someone who was confused as to why we received the notice of termination and title in the mail. She said it appears we still have an outstanding balance. She said she is not in the loan department and doesn’t have a good answer. The person who signed the paperwork is not in office until Monday, and we were told they would follow up with us. So, it sounds so far like it may have been a mistake. She also confirmed our payments had not changed, and was unsure of why we were seeing something different on our end.",0,1732379523.0

Santander Car Loan Amortization Help,"I have a loan with Santander for my car, and so far I've made four payments (once monthly). As I understand it, you usually pay more to interest towards the start of your loan (because interest is paid on the current balance), but the amount should decrease over time.

However, I'm looking back at my four payments, and I've noticed that the percentage going towards interest is *increasing* each time. I've included a table with the information.

The transaction amount varies month to month because it depends how much money I have to spare each month. The minimum payment is 337.78.

Am I doing something wrong? Do I need to specify where I want the money to go? I've heard some bad things about Santander. Is it possible that there's something going on that I don't know about?

"Partner and I can't get approved for apartment even with a cosigner, just because my credit is bad. ","So my fiancée and I find ourselves in a frustrating situation. The income requirement for the apartment we are interested in is 3 times the rent. My fiancée alone makes over 4.5 times the monthly rent. I make a small amount but not much because I am still a student. Neither of us have any debt. We both have previous renting history separately. Her credit score is good (high 700s). I have never had a credit card or borrowed money so going in we expected I would have no credit to speak of. I didn't even check my credit score. But we should have been fine, our other circumstances should have been enough. 

What we didn't know was that when they ran my credit we found that due to previously undiscovered identify theft my credit score is toast(488). We were ""approved with conditions"" because of this. Our options are:

1. Get a cosigner  
2. Pay a $600 non refundable security fee

  
Obviously we don't want to pay the 600, so we thought to have her mother be the cosigner. But it turns out that cosigner's income must be 4.5 times the rent! Her mother does not make that much, so we are afraid that she will not be approved. It just does not make sense to me that a cosigner is needed due to my bad credit, but the cosigner requirement that we are stuck on is based on income, which my fiancée should take care of all on her own. Basically the cosigner isn't giving them any extra security in our case.

  
I have submitted everything needed to clear my name and fix my credit score, but it will take 30-90 days and we do not have the time to wait that long for this apartment. The apartment agency will not recognize my identity theft situation as legit until the whole thing is settled and removed from my credit. We have tried suggesting a few things to the apartment agency with no success. We have tried:

\- Asking if we can pay the $600 and then get it back once my credit clears. They say no, which is frustrating, because all my research shows this fee is almost always refundable or part of the security deposit. They are holding on to it for no reason.

\- Asking if I can be removed from the application

\- Asking if her mother could be a cosigner anyways since all together the income is more than enough. This option could work, but the cosigner application is $50 even if she is not approved and we would still have to pay $600 at that point.

  
Any suggestions or ideas on what action to take? Is it worth the risk to attempt the cosigner solution? This whole situation seems very unnecessary.",0,1732219391.0

Is it possible to have a conversation on the Roth vs Trad IRA question?,"I am long retired and worked before Roth IRAs were a thing and am a bit surprised by the love of the Roth over the traditional IRA here.    It seems to me to be a math problem.    Higher tax rates while working means use the deduction and lower tax rates in retirement means take advantage of the lower tax burden.   Yes there are RMDs but that is why you are investing for retirement to use that money when you are no longer working.

My career started out like yours I imagine.  Low 20% incremental tax rate, but as I got older I was able to make iit to higher brackets and lived in a state with state income tax, so typically paid an incremental tax rate in the upper 20% and occasionally lower 30%.   So I needed and valued the tax deduction.   Now many years in retirement we are running around the 24% incremental bracket.   There is no way a Roth IRA would have made since in my case.

Do you somehow think you will be paying a higher incremental tax rate in retirement.    If you are an oustanding saver and investor that may be true, but I bet for most it is not.",0,1732030900.0

    **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** 
    
    * My boyfriend and I have wanted a dog for years, and his heart has always been set on a mini australlian shepherd (which I have read isn't a AKC recognized breed) or a pitbull of some sort. I love all dogs and would be open to just about any breed, I'm just concerned about the energy level of an aussie and the apartment restrictions on bully breeds. Personallly, corgis, dachshunds, and Weimaraners are a couple of my favorites, but I'm more focused on personality than breed. 
    
    **What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?** 
    
    * This dog will be a companion
    
    **What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?** Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?
    
    * Lots of experience owning. I used to foster so I have a bit more experience in training than average. I have cared for puppies, seniors, and in between.
    
    **Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?** If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?

    **Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?** What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?

    * Weekly or every few days

Is this a common occurrence??,"Any insight or advice would be appreciated

Dog is impatient with electric door and may break it soon,"We just put in an electric door to help a small dog we just got in and out of the house and it’s worked well for that.

Record my expenses with the help of AI?,"Hello, I need an app or website or anything to record my daily expenses. I want to be able to enter a text like “I spent $4 in a coffee shop named Baltazar and I paid with credit” or another example could be “Yesterday I spent $15 on a T-shirt, With cash”

In the first case, I want the app/AI to recognize and categorize the money spent on food. And in the second case; without me even saying it) I needed to categorize it as clothes AND that it was yesterday. Categorization setup is not something that would bother me doing manually the first time, so for example, if I connect a coffee shop with food, whenever I say, I spend money on a coffee shop, it should be categorized as food. On the other hand, my final idea is to export all that to an Excel, to be able to analyze it later on, or even if the app itself has some analysis on the go or graphs available. It would be great, but both options are good
 I would also need to categorize What method of payment I used. And the currency.

Is there any AI or APP that can track this easily?",0,1731690818.0

Trying to figure out why I got turned down for two loans even though I have this credit score,"So I recently applied for two personal loans from NFCU, first $5000 and then once they declined that one, I tried for $2500 to ask whether or not I was just asking for too much money.

With that in mind, let me try to explain as best I can and if anyone has any further questions, I'd be more than happy to answer...

I got the letter today explaining why they got declined. Not exactly why, but it could be ""no bank card credit accounts/installment credit accounts reported, number of months since max credit line usage, amount of utilization on non-mortgage credit accounts"". I have zero idea what any of this means, hence why I'm here, so can someone please break that down for me like  need it drawn out in crayon, because I do?

Additionally, and hence the title, TransUnion says I have a 699 credit score. I don't know shit about credit, but from my days as a car salesman, ""700 players"", customers with 700+ scores, were godsends, to the point of where we used to half-joke that when you get one, ""tell them to pick whatever color they want and we'll handle the rest"" because their finance options are so easy. So here's me, 699 credit score, getting declined for loans as little - and I know ""little"" is relative - as $2500.

So with that said, can someone explain how it is that if my credit score is so ""high"", why that happened? And additionally, what do I do to....idk, fix, improve, whatever my credit so this doesn't happen again?

Thanks in advance. Like I said if you need any more info from my side, just ask. Otherwise, hope you guys have a great evening and stay safe.

EDIT: Came back to mention, since a few of you are already asking, yes, I am employed full-time, and also get VA disability every month. Communicated this during the application and still got turned down.",0,1732475284.0

Confusion about how much to save ,"Question 1: how much should I be saving for an emergency fund?

I’m 22 y/o with monthly expenses of $2,200 with an extremely stable and high demand job in the hvac trade. I’m in no way worried about job security as if I got fired tomorrow I’d have a job by the following day.

On top of that I contribute to my 401k up to the max for the company match through work and also max out my Roth IRA every year and have been since 2022. With that being said, should I even bother investing any left over income after expenses into a taxable brokerage account to invest in the basics like S&P or put that money towards other things?

"Am First Responder, first time single with dog","I have an almost three year old Bull Terrier. My girlfriend and I are breaking up. 

I work 3pm-140am for 5 days, and have 4 and 5 day weekends. I plan on finding a neighbor to let him out around 8-9 pm on my work weeks.

He mainly sleeps in the daytime, and gets some energy bursts at night, but he does excellent in a crate. Sometimes he won’t ask to go potty and it’s been 12 hours (usually from evening-early afternoon time). 

I would let my girlfriend take him but she does not prioritize walking and behavior training like I do. 

I guess I’m looking for input if having a dog walker is still okay. This is a stressful time and my boy means the world to me.

My 2 years old golden retriever is very aggressive ,"So i have a golden retriever, he just turned two 2 months back & hes very aggressive to the people he doesn't know. He was fine when he was a little puppy. I had him since he was 50 days old. Lived in an apartment with me, & my flatmates. I took him for walks every few weeks but then i got busy with office & soon i lost that habit. But when he was 6 months old, i took him for a walk & he was really aggressive towards everyone back then. So after that i usually took him in the afternoon or late at night when there was nobody around & it was fine.
My WFH ended soon after so i had to move him to my parents place in a different city. I lived with them after we moved for a few weeks so he too would get comfortable with everybody, which he did.

But.. whenever someone passed by the main gate, be it a vehicle or an animal or a human, he started barking at them madly. Idk how to make him comfortable with all that. Hes been in the car a lot of times & still he looks at the windows & starts barking.

I moved back to my work location soon after & visited every few months. Hes always glad to see me after such long periods.

How do i stop him from barking all the time? I mean its alright when he does that playfully.. when he wants something, but when someone else is around.. he just gets mad & uncontrollable. Any suggestions on how to stop this behaviour? 

I might have been a bad parent for him ig.",1,1726503595.0
What dog breed do you think fits best?,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I have a 3 year old Miniature Poodle. I trained her with the intention for her to become a service dog for scent alerts however she began barking at seemingly random times in public (due to pain) so she washed. I am very interested in dog behaviour and clicker training so she has a lot of great training and skills. I have taught at the local puppy school and completed lots of online courses. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I want to go through a reputable breeder. I thought I had gotten my last dog from a reputable breeder but have since discovered I did not.  

3) Describe your ideal dog.

Companion dog, and hobby dog sports. I want a dog that I can do a lot of stuff with. I invest a lot of time in training and get a lot of joy from it so it is important that the dog also enjoys training. When not actively engaged I would like it to be able to settle by itself. I want to be able to take the dog pretty much anywhere in public without it reacting to things, I understand the training needed but genetically they need to be able to achieve this. I like to cuddle at night on the couch and in bed, but I do not want the dog to constantly need to be on top of me. 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Miniature poodle, working cocker spaniels, working springer spaniels, Brittanys. I like their biddability and look. However I'm open to hearing about any breeds you think could meet my criteria. I am happy to have a high energy dog, but very open to a lower energy breed. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I would like a dog who could be trained in many things, a jack of all trades ideally.  

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

I would like to continue to try novice sports but I don't intend to compete in any sports.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

About 3-4 hours of my day are devoted entirely to my dog. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

We usually do a 45-60 minute off leash walk exploring an area. A few rounds of fetch in the backyard. Then either a training session or a meal in some form of enrichment. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I'm happy to do whatever is needed.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium, no smaller than a miniature poodle. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I am not a fan of barking, but I don't expect my dog to be silent all the time. The less shedding the better but I am comfortable with some.  I can not deal with slobber. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Being able to be off leash is very important to me however I am happy to put in a lot of training to make that possible. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I like to have cuddles but it's important that they can respect people personal space.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I get a lot of joy from training, so I would like a dog who also enjoys it! 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Ideally they would bark once or twice and then sit politely if they know the person or run to tell me if its a stranger.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I do not want an aggressive dog. Excessive barking. Separation anxiety. The inability to settle. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

About 3 hours, then I come home for lunch and we play fetch and wee, then I go back to work for another 3 hours. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

N/A

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

Miniature poodle, 3 years old, female, desexed 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not regularly, but I would like my dog to be neutral to children. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No. That won't ever be an issue.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Brisbane, Australia.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer gets hot, up to 40 celsius. Winter gets to like 10 celsius. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I think I would like a different breed for my second dog, but I'm open to another Miniature Poodle if that truely seems like the best fit.

This beast plays with any toy for 5 min or so, and then Goblin mode hits and he goes *surgical* on it. He basically takes on an edge (or seam, if a fabric toy) and metodically chews on that spot as if in a trance. After he finds an opening, his only focus is absolutely ripping it apart.

I let him play with a Tuffy ring and destroy felted dog bones when I'm around to supervise, but all I can leave at home when I'm out is a Benebone, any other toy is a potential hazard.

  
Any ideas? I'm all ears.

Thank you!!

Tips to keep dog from eating cat food?,"So I'm brining home my new puppy at the end of November. I currently have a 10yr old rescued cat that was declawed by her previous owners. My issue is she doesn't like to jump because I'm assuming it hurts her paws, and our puppy is a miniature pinscher, so he won't be much bigger than our cat when fully grown. 

Me and my boyfriend are kind of struggling to figure out a solution to keep the puppy away from her food when he's older. My cat does not eat all at once and feeds throughout the day so it's not like we can separate them until they are both finished eating. We are currently trying to feed her on a table but she's having none of that and screams at us because her food is not on the floor. I've been considering putting a ramp up to the table but again, I fear that the dog will just climb up their himself and eat her food anyway. 

Obviously for the first two years while he's training he'll be kenneled or put in a pen while we are away, but when we're home I can't constantly be watching to make sure he doesn't sneak up and eat her food. I don't know, anyone have any success keeping a small dog away from a handicapped cat?",1,1730546962.0

scent work enrichment game advice needed ,"hi guys! So i’m thinking of this new idea for enrichment but, i have a question. let me explain it so you understand. So i apologize in advance this might be long. 

I want to train my dog this new tracking/scent work/retrieval game inspired by a video I saw. Basically I’ll get a scent on a q tip or crumbled up napkin. Hide a bunch of them in a field of grass. Give her the scent and let her go find them and bring it back to me one by one. I think this will be super tiring for my dog and fun. But, that brings me to my question. What scents can I use? I was thinking dog safe essential oils but she’s gonna have it in her mouth to bring it back to me. Is that safe? I know essential oils are used for scent work for dog sports but the dog doesn’t retrieve the scent or put it in their mouth, correct me if i’m wrong. She won’t eat it (i hope) but i imagine her holding it in her mouth she could probably taste it on her tongue so she’s still ingesting a very little amount and keep in mind I plan to do this often as a fun exercise and eventually I might be putting out 20 or more q tips for her to find depending on how long she wants to go for. The q tip won’t have a lot of essential oil on it. Just a drop. That should be enough to get the scent strong enough to find right? But i don’t know. Maybe i’m thinking into it too much. 

If essential oil isn’t a good idea what are some alternative scents? Preferably something liquid and very pungent so it acts in the same way essential oils do. 

Any thoughts/tips/advice? Is this a good idea? Would you change anything about this game? I’m honestly just looking for ways to tire out my dog other than just going on walks. 

Thank you guys! Have a good night!",1,1729575599.0

How to make senior dog forgive me (forcing medicine down throat)? ,"My precious little girl is 11 years old. Shes a golden retriever and is very ill. I need to give her medicine and take her to the vet a lot recently. Both I have to do with a lot of force. She’s a been very good dog her whole life and I’ve never had to reprimand her much as she has learned very quickly & quite well behaved. 

Recently she’s been getting upset at me. I have to force medicine down her throat and she doesn’t understand that it is for her own good. 

How do I make her forgive me? I have to give this medication to her twice a day. She is too tired to walk away from me but I can tell she is upset. She refuses to make eye contact with me and never wags her tail when she sees me anymore (also could be a side effect of her tiredness).

Question about Charge Off and Settlement,"Hello!

Background:  I was self-employed and had a personal loan and credit card through Navy Federal that I defaulted on back in 2021 .. COVID didn't help either. So anyway, I went to apply for a mortgage recently and this negative mark on my credit is hurting me.  I have a few missed credit card payments from a few years ago, but other than those I have been steadily rebuilding my credit and it is rising (around 570 now). Navy Federal has this listed as a ""Charge Off"" on my report, and it just hit my credit report in Sept 2024.

 I contacted Navy Federal to get information about this and they said they are having a third party collect the debt (Apelles, LLC which is a collections agency). I contacted Apelles and they said I can either pay the total debt in full (around $26k) or they will settle with me and I will have to pay $8900 (I looked back through emails from Navy Fed and this is the settlement amount they gave me also, but I was stupid and ignored it). They said they are handling the payment, and once I pay it then they will give to NFCU and then the debt on my credit report will be updated to ""Settled"" and it will no longer be listed as a ""Charge Off"". Apelles also said they will provide me with a letter stating the debt has been settled and they are no longer seeking payment, which I can give to my lender.

My Dilemma: My mortgage lender stated that since Navy Federal has this debt listed as a ""Charge Off"", means they are no longer attempting to collect the debt and they essentially wrote it off and I should receive a 1099 (to essentially report it as income, but I haven't received one). He suggested that I write a letter to NFCU and Apelles to dispute the debt and state that they are reporting this debt incorrectly and that I do not owe it (since it was charged off) according to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. However, when I spoke to Navy Federal, they said they have not charged it off and they are still seeking payment but using a third party to collect payment.

I am confused by all of this, and honestly I want to correct this on my report so that I can move on, build my score again, and get a mortgage. I am able to pay the settlement for $8900. This is the only thing that is weighing me down. I am much more responsible with my spending and I pay my cards in full every month.

What do I do? Any advice is much appreciated! Thank you!",0,1732010754.0
Couple with no kids looking for small/medium dog,"Introduction

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

No, I've owned dogs before.

As a kid our family dogs were all rescues and all labrador crosses of some type. As an adult, I used to have a rescue greyhound. He was already seven and relatively well-trained (housebroken, walked well on lead - his only real training issue was separation anxiety, which I worked with him on) when I got him though, so I've never experienced training a young dog myself.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

I can see pros and cons for both. For a breeder I like the idea of being able to train the dog myself as a ""blank slate"" and being able to see the parents and see their temperaments. The cons are that I don't have much experience training a dog and none training puppies. For a rescue I like that they generally already have some experience of being a pet. The cons are that rescue shelters in my country generally have pretty intense requirements (like a huge garden, not living anywhere near a main road, etc) that I can't meet, and rescue dogs sometimes have trauma that I might not be able to handle.

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

I would like a relatively small or medium dog that is friendly, easy to train/biddable and doesn't have very high maintenance exercise needs.

My partner and I have considered/are currently considering a whippet, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (though their health issues do concern me a lot), or potentially another greyhound. We've also considered a Bichon Frise or a Maltese but neither of us are really a fan of that super fuzzy look.

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

The basics would be walking well on a leash, going potty, sit, stay, and good recall. Outside of that, if it was relatively easy to train I might teach it a few tricks.

**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

No and no.

**Care Commitments**

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

I would like to enrol the dog in obedience classes and possibly also doggy daycare to make sure it gets socialisation with other dogs. I have spare time to play with it each day, particularly at lunch (for about half an hour) and after work.

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

I work from home, so I can be with the dog all day. I would ideally like to take it for a short five to ten minute walk each morning before work and then a longer hour to hour-and-a-half walk in the evening after work.

There's a small enclosed dog park near me that I can take the dog to for off-leash stuff, as well as larger parks where it would need to remain on a leash.

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

I'd prefer a dog without a double coat, as growing up we had a labrador/GSD mix and while she was an angel, I still remember the shedding with horror. But I can groom the dog for a short time each day (or for a longer period on a weekly basis), and am happy to trim hair, clean ears, and so on. I am also happy to pay a professional for regular grooming.

**Personal Preferences**

**10) What size dog are you looking for?**

Small to medium. I don't like super duper small toy breeds, as I feel nervous about hurting them.

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

A little of all of those is OK. I'd prefer to not have an extremely noisy dog or a dog that sheds a lot (think GSD levels).

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

It's not massively important to me, but it would be a nice bonus.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

I'd like a snuggly, affectionate dog.

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

I'd prefer a dog that's eager to please. I've dealt with stubborn dogs before and it's not something I'm very good at navigating.

**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

I would prefer a dog that leans more towards the friendly side of things.

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

I would prefer not to deal with that. Some of my family members have dogs too so it would be nice if they got along on the occasions that they meet.

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

I'd prefer to avoid a dog with extremely high energy levels and stimulation needs, like a collie.

**Lifestyle**

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Maybe half an hour each day when I go out to buy food. Though having said that, my partner lives with me so one of us can always stay with the dog if needed. Sometimes on weekends we might want to leave the house for an hour or two to see a movie or go out to eat. Otherwise, there'll pretty much always be someone at home, most likely me.

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

I live with my partner, who has never owned a dog before (even as a kid). His preferences are pretty much identical to mine. He'll be taking care of the dog equally - we'll be walking it together, grooming together, etc.

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

We might want a cat in the future but there are no solid plans for that and it's not a must-have. For example, if we were to get a whippet or a greyhound I would probably just scratch a cat off the to-get list for my own peace of mind. We have no current pets.

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

No, my partner and I are not having kids and there are no children in the family the dog would regularly see or interact with.

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

No, I'm a homeowner.

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

I'm in a city in the UK.

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

Typical summers here are around 21 to 28°C (69 to 82°F) and typical winters are 2 to 8°C (35 to 44°F), though they can drop to below freezing on occasion.

**Additional Information and Questions**

**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

My home has a small garden but the emphasis should be on small: it's not really a great space for a dog, even a small one, to really run around in. The majority of exercise would take place either at the dog park nearby or on walks.

**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**

"Got my first job, how to allocate $ to reach my goals?","Hi everyone I am a 22 year old recent college grad who just got my first job and am seeking to learn more on investing given my goals. 

I have been into personal finance for about 3 years now, but have more so been watching from the sidelines and learning since I haven’t had much income. With this being my first job I should now be able to actually invest consistently and am interested in recommendations on allocations given my goals.

I currently have about $9,000 in a brokerage $7,000 in my Roth, and $3,000 in an HYSA. My car is paid off and I have no debt.

I start my job next month and I’ll make about $90,000 before taxes and deductions. The plan is to contribute 401k and HSA only up to max matching (3% salary and $400 for HSA).

After deductions and taxes I’ll take home around $5,400 per month. I live with my mom and will pay half expenses so expenses will only come out to around $2,000 - $2,300 per month. 

$583 of my income after expenses will certainly go to my Roth so I can max it each year. However, how should I allocate the remaining ~ $2400? I do plan on building my HYSA to more than $3,000. Besides that, should the remainder go to my brokerage, should I increase 401-K/HSA contribution, or continue putting more $ into my HYSA? Are there any other investment tools I should learn about?

As far as my goals go, I would like to move out of home within 2-3 years. I want to eventually purchase a home as well. I’m also interested in starting/buying a cpa firm at some point in the future when I’m ready (probably in 7-10 years). 

I’d be happy to provide any additional information if needed, and would greatly appreciate any advice for my situation. ",0,1731956391.0
Is a Home Equity Loan Right for My Situation?,"I would like your opinion on my financial situation.

I (30m) have some credit card debt that I am looking to pay off as soon as possible.

* Card 1: $5,850 (27.49%)
* Card 2: $10,800 (15.74%)
* Card 3: $5,850 (21.74%)
* Card 4: $4,200 (27.49%)
* Card 5: $11,350 (0% APR expires in July 2025)
* Card 6: $19,600 (0% APR expires in April 2026)

I also have a student loan of $4,800 and a private loan from a family member of $80,000, both at 5%. The student loan payments are $60 a month, and the personal loan payments are $500 a month (although I would love to repay it faster).

I have a mortgage for a multi-unit house valued around $880,000 (according to Redfin), and I owe around $474,000. My mortgage is at 2.75%, 30 year fixed, and my monthly payment is around $3,300 (including taxes and insurance escrow).

My gross income from work is around $115,000 a year (plus a 7.5% target bonus), so I am getting around $2,700 every two weeks after deductions (8% for 401k contributions, insurance for me and my wife, and taxes). I am receiving $7,300 a month in rent payments.

I have to financially support my wife and my parents on this income. I can elaborate more as to why, but I would prefer to keep it outside of this discussion. We are working on getting a job for my wife, which should help our situation.

**Quick Summary**

Income:

* Work (net) $5,880
* Rent $7300

Expenses:

* Mortgage $3,300/month
* Rent $1020/month
* Utilities $400/month
* Food $1500/month
* Medical insurance for my father $1000/month
* Car insurance $170/month
* Gas $200/month
* Internet $80/month
* Cell phone (4 lines) $110/month

I have other expenses that vary from month to month. I am trying to be conscious about them, but it can be quite challenging, considering there are 3 other people I am paying for. Overall, I am estimating my total expenses be around $8,000 a month, on average.

I have a 401k with approximately $40,000 invested and no other significant savings.

Would a home equity loan be a good option for me? What amount do you think I could/should request and how big could the closing costs be? I am worried that my debt to income ratio could be too low. How would I go about estimating whether a home equity loan would be worth it over paying everything off one by one using the avalanche method? Are there any solutions I could be missing or are there any other questions that I should be asking?

To Buy A Used Truck or To Not Buy?,"TLDR: I want to buy a vehicle before the end of year, is it the right move?

I currently drive a 2010 Nissan Altima with 250,000+ miles, I’ve had the car since high school (now 24) and have planned on driving it to 300,000. However, starting last year I’ve began having to put ~$3,000 a year in new parts into the vehicle to keep it running - this is getting costly for me.

I do not plan on selling the car as it’s paid off, I want to park it at my folks house (they’re willing to start/drive it when needed, air tires, routine maintenance, etc.) in Tennessee and over the next few years continue putting new parts into it. (I’m living Florida currently)

I don’t like and have never wanted to be in debt but the specific type of vehicle I want is a truck. I want a truck because it can be used as a tool for moving, will be safer, and I would be paying cheaper insurance than my current 2-door Altima. I would plan on doing all the regular routine maintenance on the truck as I have with my current car for it to last well over 200k. 

I would like to purchase a truck for ~$25,000 before the end of year as prices are the best for vehicles this time of year. Would this be a bad decision due to the major price point  or should I continue dumping the $3k annually into my car?

I’d like to pay $10,000 in cash and get a auto loan for the remaining $15,000. I have $0 in debt thankfully, $12,000 in a HYSA that I’ll use for the cash portion, $3,500 in savings, $1,000 in checking, $33,500 in a brokerage account (about $10,000 in cash at the moment), and $22,000 across my 401k and Roth IRA. I also currently make about $80,000 a year and have a 879 credit score.

Would I be making a bad decision to purchase a truck for $25,000? My rationale is the money I’m spending on my current car would just go into the trucks payment every year. I would also now have a truck I can use as a tool, safer vehicle, and larger for if/when I do have a family. I also have to drive somewhat regularly for work.

My ultimate goal in life is financial freedom and a purchase like this is hard for me to make, but I feel like it’s a justifiable decision if I’m planning on keeping the truck for 10+ years, and that I will be paying around the same or $100 more for the trucks payment and insurance versus the $320 monthly insurance payment I’m making on my 2010 Nissan Altima 2-door.

I thank you all in advance for any suggestions/advice in this situation.

Is this a problem trainers can help with? Possibly reactive when dogs threaten him,"Hey everyone, I could use some advice. Lately my dog’s reaction to aggressive dogs has been getting worse and worse. In the past year, we’ve had maybe 5-6 aggressive dogs charge at him on our walks, and I haven’t been the best at getting in between them in time, so I know that makes it worse for him. But his reaction after these times were normal. He would freeze, or sometimes angrily bark at them. Those dogs haven’t physically hurt him thankfully. Last weekend though, we were at the dog park (we are officially done with those places though), and two dogs cornered mine by one getting on each side of him, and they both were growling. And then right as I tried to intervene, by dog did a mean correcting bark to get them to back off, and then they all were barking and snarling at each other. They were all over each other, so I grabbed my dog’s harness to pull him away, and then he bit down on a dog, and it took probably like 30 seconds to get him to release the other dog. 😞

Afterwards, I read that grabbing your dog is not recommended because it can freak them out, thinking it’s a dog getting them, so maybe the bite was my fault. And ultimately I know that the other dogs started it with their growling and cornering him. But I don’t want my dog biting another dog anytime the other dog shows small signs of aggression. 

Can a trainer help with this? I’ve also heard from people that me being better at stepping in and protecting my dog is needed so that he trusts that I will take care of him, and he doesn’t have to. Is doing this enough? What else should I be doing? I would love to help him on my own because I don’t really have tons of money to try and see if a trainer can help. I’m also not sure how a trainer can help without putting him in those situations (which surely is a bad idea) because he’s so friendly and loves other dogs. But I obviously really want to avoid my dog hurting another dog, and him potentially becoming reactive. 😞

Money Budgeting - Struggling to Find a Method That Works For my Brain,"Hello, I graduated HS in 2019 (I'm 22, graduated at 17) and since then I have budgeted my money. However, it's proven to be harder now that I actually have to spend money (I didn't spend much in HS or for a couple years afterwards, I basically just saved). My goal is to have a method where I can input what I've spent for certain categories (i.e. groceries, gas, etc.) as soon as I've spent it so I can have a constantly updated budget. 

Typically I track my money bi-weekly, timed with when I get my paycheque. I will do my best to describe how I manage this, but with the method I have now it's not always accurate nor is it automated. 

When I get a paycheque, I will set money aside for any bills and expenses. I know the set amounts for things like rent, car payment, etc. so I ensure I have enough for that month by the time it's due. Once I've done that, I will take a look at my purchases for the past two weeks from when I got paid last. Whatever money I've spent, I will give it a category in which the money is coming from (i.e. if I spent $50.00 on cat food, it will come from my savings for my cat). I make all of my purchases like this with my credit card, so once I've sorted out what categories my purchases come from, I will write how much I have remainder for each category, and take the sum from my savings and pay off my credit card. Aside from giving myself \~$60 to spend how I please that I keep in my chequing, I put all of my money in my savings and move it when necessary.

  
I would like to have an Excel/Google Sheets that shows me precentages, pie charts, and shows me my income compared to spending. I've tried two different sheets that you can purchase, and neither help me much, if at all. I'm not familiar enough with the formula's you need to use to make things like this. If I was I would make one, and I have even tried to do that, but I still seem unable to do so. 

Can someone help me either find one that tracks money similarily to how I already do it, or resources that actually have proper formulas.

How to invest my money the best way possible?,"I’m a recent graduate who has landed a high-paying job earning around $200K annually. I’m 21 years old and would like to know the best way to invest this money to maximize its potential. My cost of living is relatively low.

I’ve heard of things like 401(k)s, life insurance policies, and the S&P 500, but I’m not very familiar with them. Currently, I have around $50K in a high-yield savings account earning 4% APY, but I believe I should diversify my portfolio and invest in other options for retirement.

Paying off $70k of student loan debt in 2 years. Worth it?,"Here's the bullet points. Monthlies
Income (Me and Wife): $7k
Fixed Expenses: $3k (Just trust me, I did a whole budget, took many hours to triple check it)
Federal Loan: $35k at 5% interest
Private Loan: $25k at 7.5% interest
Waterproofing Loan: $9,700 at 11%

With $4k coming in profit per month, I calculated that we can throw $3k per month for two years to be completely debt free (besides one car and our mortgage, but that's in the Fixed Expenses).

I currently contribute $100 per month into a Roth IRA (also included in my Fixed Expenses) and have been doing this for the last 8 years. Currently worth $13k. My wife and I both have pensions through our employer.

We also have 4 months worth of savings for emergency.

Unsure on how to balance my savings / retirement,"I’m sure this question has been asked a number of times here. I’ve been struggling with this for the past couple of years, and i’m starting to become restless over his topic.  

Some background. I’m 25 in a hcol making 150k annually. My net worth is around 270k. 140k is locked up in retirement, 25k in company ESPP, and the rest in an HYSA. My biggest goals are to have a house, be financially comfortable with my future family, and retire early if possible.  

My expenses are about 1700 a month excluding food. I max out my Roth IRA, 401k, and HSA. I pay my expenses, spend a chunk on food/entertainment, and save the rest. Cheapest houses around my area are around 650k. Should i stop maxing out my retirement accounts to save for a house? Should I invest instead of a HYSA? I want to buy a house before I turn 30.

help with fear of the vet?,"Have a three-year old lab we rescued from a family member.  When we got the dog in May she weighed 56 pounds, she's at a healthy weight now but she's terrified of the vet's office and almost squirmed her way out of a harness this morning.

We had her neutered in August and when the vet brought her out to us after surgery she was in a complete panic once she saw me.  She got a minor surgical infection a week after surgery and when I brought her to the vet he asked me to stand her on her hind legs so he could look at the incision and she peed all over his floor (I had walked her about half an hour prior).

Took her back to the vet today to get stitches removed and to say that she was uncooperative would be an understatement but we got the job done and she peed on herself while on her side having stitches removed.

Besides giving treats for good behavior what else can I do to help ease her anxiety?  It's gonna be about a year before she needs to see the vet again but this is really tough on the dog.

What can I do to help?

Copy of my credit report included a total stranger’s full report. Should I be worried? ,"Hello Reddit, 
I recently requested a copy of my credit report from the three major credit unions. I received my full report from TransUnion, and nothing under personal information or account history seems out of the ordinary. However, at the very end of the report, there’s a section called SUPPLEMENTAL PUBLIC RECORDS AND RESIDENTIAL INFORMATION, and under his section it lists a land assessment or something done back in 2018 on a couple acres of property. I don’t own any property and have no idea what this section is about. 

Then after my report ends there’s a full report for another person in a different state who I don’t recognize. This stranger has the same land assessment listed on their report. 

It’s really bizzare and I have no idea what to make of it. Why do I have a copy of this random person’s report? Was my identity stolen in 2018 and then they didn’t do anything with it? Do I need to do anything about this?

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large, ideally want a decent sized dog 

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

How would you spend the stupid settlement in pre-paid cards?,"A couple of years ago I received a settlement from the Equifax breach, a virtual card with $9 in it. I didn't know what I'd spend 9 bucks on so I tried to charge the money in my Amazon wallet, and amazon immediately locked my account and demanded a scan of paper statement proving the card is mine even though the card's details are exactly what Amazon have for me on file. Of course there is no paper statement, so the Amazon account is gone and the cash was back in the card. I forgot about it then checked the card balance about 10 months later, and found that my balance is zero and the money was stolen by the issuer because of a weird ""inactivity"" clause.

Anyway, I just got notification of another round of payments, which is the court ordered distribution of any remaining money from the original settlement that was not redeemed, and this time I do not want to lose it no matter if it's another $9 or even $3.

Can you please advise on how I could get that money our of the virtual card when it comes?",0,1732485755.0
I don’t know what toys to get my dog,"I adopted a dog a little over 2 weeks and slowly but surely his personality is starting to reveal itself. It’s been a real joy, but one thing I can’t figure out is what kind of toys to get for him.

He’s a Border collie/Saint Bernard, about 50 pounds and likely getting bigger. His favorite things to do with toys are to meticulously chew at the seams of them to rip them open, to chew off any soft pieces that stick out from the toy, and to thrash them around/whip them back and forth. He also loves shredding things Ike cardboard and paper. That said, he’s actually incredibly gentle and doesn’t even bite toys hard enough to make them squeak, so he’s shown no interest in harder rubber-like toys like kongs or the ones you’d get in the super chewer bark box.

I feel like I can’t buy him toys for chewers, but I can’t buy him plush toys either. I’m worried if I got him a rope he’d just chew on the ends of it and pull out/eat the threads. He loves his chuck-it balls and holee-roller, but I’d like him to have more options than that. The only other toy that’s lasted is the bark box Cactus that has another toy inside of it. For some reason he hasn’t tried to rip that one open. Anyone have any ideas?",1,1727865453.0

Newly Transplanted Liver Survivor Looking for Training Advice,"Hey all! I'm new to this community and navigating Reddit for the first time. I’m just over two months post-liver transplant, and my husband is going back to work tomorrow after caring for me.

I’m dealing with intense joint pain and difficulty getting around, but I just got my two dogs back! I have a 2-year-old, 60 lb Shepherd-Beagle mix named Frae (she's named after someone, and it's pronounced like ""Fray"") and a smaller mixed breed named Greta, affectionately known as “Little Bit,” who is a 4-year-old, 13lb Jack Russell-Chihuahua mix.

Unfortunately, I can’t withstand more than 20 lbs of pressure on my body right now, so walking them isn’t an option. We live in an apartment that requires leashes for outdoor poop breaks, so my husband and I put some fake grass on our balcony.

I’m hoping to train them to use these pads since I’m not supposed to be around any animal waste. My husband has graciously offered to clean up when he gets home, but I want to prevent any accidents inside.

We've already been working with them, and they have gone to the bathroom on the grass mats, but they still want to go outside and not just on the balcony. I’m looking for training tips to help them understand that the balcony is their new bathroom for now—preferably something that will work relatively quickly! I absolutely will NOT be able to handle rehoming my babies. I missed them way too much during my recovery.

Online Breed Quizzes are confusing! ,"Hello lovely people 🥹

I have been binge-consuming educational content about dogs and contemplating the idea of getting one for quite some time now, but I have been struggling with figuring out which breed would be most suitable to my personality and lifestyle.

Unfortunately, I have been quite overwhelmed from the breed quizzes I have made so far, especially after researching a suggested one’s traits in an independence source for it to turn out to be quite the opposite of my requirements. So here I am in the hands of this awesome community! 



1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

First time dog owner. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I would prefer to go through a reputable breeder. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

I work from home for most of the time and even when I am not, my schedule can be worked up so the dog is not left alone. 
I am moderately active person and depending on the mood I can be either a cuddly couch potato or doing a hardcore hike, so a dog tolerating days with low activity and being able to jump on a hike during the weekend, would be a match made in heaven. 
I also have to drive (~5hrs) occasionally to visit family members, so being able to take the dog with me would be awesome. Also, I can very well imagine going on a road trip with it every now and then. 
Enjoying socialisation with adults/babies and animals would be a huge bonus.
I would also love to spend time training my dog doing more than just sit/stay and for it to be easily trainable for a first time dog owner. 
I don’t really have fur preferences, but maybe I would get annoyed if big balls of hairs are flying all over the place.



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

No preferences. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Beyond sit/stay and bond through obedience.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I imagine myself spending a couple of hours on a daily basis interacting/playing with my dog and training it for up to an hour per day.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I can accommodate at least 2*30 minutes walks on busy days and more on not so busy days. 
Playing fetch in the yard is also possible, but I don’t see myself running with the dog. 🤭 
Dog park can be accommodated but not on a daily basis.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am open to doing this at home. I would prefer not to attend to extreme brushing needs due to a lot of shedding.

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

I would prefer a large/medium dog breed, if that is suitable for a 60 sq. m./ 645 sq. ft. apartment. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Moderate. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

I would say that this is moderate-high priority. 

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A snuggly, cuddly one to the front, please! 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager-to-please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Curiosity, friendliness. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I am confident I could manage that with the right tools, but would prefer not to as a first time dog owner.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Aggressiveness, disobedience. 

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

On rear occasions, no longer than 2-3 hours.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Mostly the same.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Not for now, but I am open to the possibility of having a cat.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not very often, but it is not completely out of the picture. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I am home-owner.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in Sofia, Bulgaria (biggest city in the country). I am not aware of any breeds being banned.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

We still have 4 seasons, max. temperatures during the summer would be 35 C/ 95 F, but not on any day. Winters are getting milder with occasional snows.

"Need advice on Anderson Brothers Bank, Auto Loan, SC ","So, long story short as of Nov 11, I am 3 months behind on my car payment. I bought the car from a buy here pay here but got the loan with Anderson Brothers Bank. I’m paying 23.9% interest on a 5 year loan for a 2017 Honda Accord Sport Special Edition. I’ve spoken with the bank and they told me if I could come up with one payment, they could take the other 2 payments and add them on to the back end of the loan and I’d be caught back up but the maturity date would be extended. I know nothing about this and they already got me with the interest rate because no one ever taught me how to deal with a dealership when it came to buying a car.

"Wife Laid Off, Lots of Debt, Bankruptcy? Options?","My wife was laid off on Wednesday. We were just in the midst of paying off a lot of debt we had back when we were both unemployed and dealing with health issues, and a failed attempt to start a business.

I expect finding a new job won't be easy.

Retirement Account Contributions,"Hi all, I am looking at opening an IRA but I want to be strategic about it. I have an offer where I can get a 3% match on contributions to an IRA with a specific company, and I have the ability to open a Roth or a Traditional with them. Currently I make less than any of the Roth IRA income limits, but my career trajectory may soon take me past them, requiring me to use a backdoor strategy. My thought was that I could simply open a traditional IRA with the 3% match company and a Roth IRA with a different company, and start using the backdoor strategy now, even though I don't have to. Here's the catch: I have to keep contributions in the account for 4 years to get the 3% match. I'm curious if anyone has thoughts on this and can help me think through the tradeoffs here. Thanks!

Need to make 2500 for rent -- from home -- disabled family member at home I take care of,"Hello,

I take care of my disabled dad and he presently doesn't qualify for any assistance. I can't leave him alone as it would be dangerous and two lawyers said I couldn't for if something happens I could get charged with a crime.

Lost job 9 months ago and landlord doesn't care and will evict if rent is not paid on time. Have enough for next month but after that will be at zero.

Is there anything I could do from home to make money? Nothing illegal or that doesn't involve nudity. We're nearly maxed out on credit cards so it's not like I can put down any capital down to start a business. I can grill decently but I can't leave the house and take a fast-food job, cause can't leave dad lone. It might take months and months to get any type of assistance at home due to waitlists and no nursing homes will take him b/c of his medical condition. I tried and called and was told no from different places.

I figured if someone would know they could let me know. The job market has been brutal this past year. 

Thanks

Close Traditional IRA,"Hello! I (F19) in my senior year of high school decided to open a traditional IRA to get started early on my fiances (I believe either around the age of 17 or just as I turned 18). Of course as I educated myself more and took some financial literacy classes, I learned that a Roth IRA is a better option and did a rollover after consulting with my professor. (Quick Context, I use robinhood as it's the easiest for me to navigate atm).

Recenly, I was talking to my sister a bit about opening one as she found interest in doing so and I remembered I still had my traditional IRA open (empty of course, it's just sitting there).

Now I'm not really financially literate, (I understand the concepts of things but when it comes to the depth, a manual for dummies does their best), but I know closing an IRA account can get you taxed a pretty penny. But idk if keeping it open and empty can get me in financial trouble as well.

Should I close it and face the penalty or keep it open and just not touch it? All advice is welcome, thank you!",0,1732079465.0

Charters that allow large dogs?,"I’m looking into transport for me and my dog from California to DC (USA). I know it’s an option and have done the drive with my pup before (lots of moving in the past few years for us), but I’m looking into other alternatives this time in order to save us some time.

She weighs 50 pounds and is well-behaved, but I know that major airlines only allow large breeds in cargo. I definitely want to look at other options before deciding if it’s worth it to put her in cargo.

I’ve looked into JSX and they unfortunately don’t have a route that would work for us atm. Are there any other private or chartered airlines that you know of that would allow her to be in cabin with me? Or any services you have had positive experiences with with your own dogs?

New dachshund causing some issues with two resident dachshund: advice! ,"Background: 

I have one senior male min pin mix. He’s kind of just whatever and goes with the flow, not an issue. 

Then I have two miniature dachshunds who are not siblings, but bonded. Male is 2 and female is 1. They are BEST friends and love each other so much. 

I also have 5 cats. 

All animals are spayed/neutered. 

Current: 

I rescued a neglected 1 yr old intact female. She’s about 3 pounds underweight (a 3/9 on the body score scale, should be a 4.5-5) and has some resource guarding issues that we are working on. I believe they mostly stem from either having to fight for her food or just not getting enough. Just in the past 4 days she has shown improvement in trusting that she will get her food and no one will steal it. 

My older dog is adjusting well, he just gets irritated when she bathes him while he’s sleeping. (She just started her heat cycle so she’s VERY much enamored with male dogs right now) 

My female is kind of like whatever and just does her own thing, a very slight lip lifts but nothing major and I corrected immediately. (Just a firm no) She is however jumping my male more which I assume is her way of staking claim to him. (She is spayed)

However, my male is struggling. There’s some jealously there. When playing with my female, and the new pup tries to join in, he started lifting his lip at her. Again, I corrected by firmly saying his name and saying no. He stopped. He’s also been clingier with me. 

My question: 
Just some advice on how to allow everyone the space to adjust but also get along. How long will the stage last? What can I do to create some bonding experiences? 

The new pup has been with us for 5 days, for point of reference. ",1,1728632179.0
Recasting current home vs. keeping the old home as rental ,"I recently purchased a new home, the original intent was to sell my previous home and to recast my mortgage to lower my new homes monthly payment but the market has slowed down some - I am currently paying two mortgages. I am now considering my options with the previous property, lowering the asking price, or keeping it as a rental for a min. of 6 months or potentially longer if it works out. 

My previous homes principle balance is approx. 209k, the interest rate is 2.99% and the monthly mortgage PITI is approx. $1,450. The monthly rental price would be anywhere between 2,100-2,300 a month. 

When I use the recasting calculators my monthly payment does not seem to drop very significantly on my new home, my current principal balance is approx. 534k, the interest rate is 6.5% and the monthly mortgage PITI is approx. $4,400. The goal is to put down an additional 90k. 

Can someone help me do the math here to determine which approach makes the most sense?",0,1732043302.0
Please guide me around HELOC as I need some cash for the next 6 months ,"
Hi everyone,  

As the title suggests, I’m seeking guidance on HELOCs.  

My wife and I both have stable incomes. However, due to recent changes in our household finances (buying a house, daycare costs for our baby, car expenses, insurance, etc.), I anticipate being short on daycare fees—approximately $2,000 per month—in about three months. For now, I’ve set some money aside to cover this gap.  

I’m actively job hunting for a better-paying position, but there’s no guarantee of when I’ll secure one. My next pay raise, scheduled in six months, will only be a 6% increase, which won’t be sufficient to address the shortfall.  

Recently, I was contacted by BoF about the option of a HELOC. This got me thinking that it could serve as a financial cushion if I’m unable to find a higher-paying job within the necessary timeframe.  

I’d appreciate any advice or insights on whether a HELOC might be a good option in this situation.  

Thank you!  ",0,1731771661.0
Can I avoid pro-rata with my Backdoor if my wife has Traditional’s/Rollovers? Newly married,"Newbie investor here so please take it easy on me. For the past 3 years I’ve been contributing directly to a Roth IRA, filing single. $6k in it (not the full amount due to my own financial reasons).

This year I got married, and we plan to file jointly. We are well over the Roth income limits so just last week I set up a backdoor Roth, have yet to invest in it.

Prior to setting this up, I did my research and am aware of the pro-rate rule; I currently have no money in my traditional IRA. But it just occurred to me that I may have made a mistake not taking into account my wife’s positions. She has a traditional and a rollover of about $80k in value.

My question is this: can I begin/continue my backdoor strategy and avoid pro-rata penalties? Or are my wife’s positions also taken into account once we start to file jointly? If so, what are our other options here — move my Roth into an individual brokerage, or have my wife perform a backdoor herself?",0,1731683202.0
Dog chews and destroys things while home alone. ,"Hi
we have a year and 3 month old sheltie (ShetlandSheepDog). And we have a problem. When we leave her alone when we leave for school she chews on things she’s not sposed to. I am talking wooden bed frame, pillows, wooden or plastic chair legs, her pillow bed or some random papers if they are left on place she can acces. 
We used to leave her in one room, but thinking she has a feeling that there is someone left at our apartment, and thats the reasone she destroys things. we let her access the kitchen and hallway. It got better for a weak, but now she’s back to where she was. 
She is left home alone after morning walk and breakfast. We usualy leave her with gong or blanket with little bit of treats to entertain her for a while. 
We are now debating getting a cage for her, but I’m not sure if that is the best idea and if it would solve the problem.

   * *I would like to teach a future dog basic obedience training, at the very least, though I would aim to train them to be a very well-behaved dog.*

**Care Commitments**

1. How long do you want to train, play with, or interact with your dog each day? 
   * *I am a homebody and do my work online. I am willing to spend most of my day socializing and training a new dog, so long as they don’t ask me for too intense of a workout, lol.*
2. How long can you exercise your dog each day? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly, and does that include using a dog park? 
   * *The majority of my day is free to walk and socialize. I am willing to buy tugging toys, balls, and anything else a dog may enjoy. I do not have a dog park in the area, however I am willing to walk my dog (ON A LEASH) around the neighborhood, down the parkway, and use the (HUMAN) park nearby.*
3. How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or grooming at home? If not, would you pay a professional to do it regularly? 
   * *I am undecided on whether or not to pay a professional groomer. I am willing to brush a dog whenever, so long as the brush is easily accessible (ADHD brain vs. me). I can clean their ears and am willing to try my hand at filing nails and trimming hair.*

**Personal Preferences** 

1. What size dog are you looking for? 
   * *Even though I love giant dogs, I’d like anything other than XS or XL.*

   * *I can handle moderate barking and plenty of slobber, just minimal to no shedding.*

   * *I would love a very sweet snuggle bug.*
2. Would you prefer a dog wanting to do its own thing or one more eager to please? 
   * *A nice, eager-to-please dog would be fantastic, but I don’t mind independence as long as they are not obstinate.*
3. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 
   * *I can handle moderate barking in either scenario, but it would be nice if they were friendly.*

   *  *No. I do not feel confident in handling an aggressive dog.*
5. Are there any other behaviors you can’t handle or want to avoid? 
   * *I would be delighted if they were good with kids and cats. Even though my many nephews don’t come over often, I want to keep their safety in mind.*

**Lifestyle**

1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 
   * *Not often. I am a homebody and would love to take a dog everywhere (ON A LEASH).*
2. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house, and what will their involvement be in caring for the dog? 
   * *A dog with minimal shedding. They will likely help allow the dog into the backyard and refill the food and water bowls. However, I would be the primary caregiver and handler.*
3. Do you have other pets, or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 
   * *I currently have two cats and two senior dogs. But, bless their poor hearts, the dogs will likely be gone by the time I feel totally confident in getting a new one.*
4. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 
   * *It's unlikely, but it would be good if they were good with children anyway.*
5. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 
   * *I am not renting, but I don't want an extremely large or small animal. It cannot be large enough to knock over anyone, but it also can't be tiny. I’m afraid I’ll trip over a smaller dog.*
6. What city or country do you live in, and are you aware of any laws banning specific breeds? 
   * *I live in Sacramento County. I am unaware of any laws banning specific breeds in my region.*
7. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 
   * *It can reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer and 52 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, which is very warm.*

**Additional Information and Questions** 

1. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. 
   * *This is not a set-in-stone decision! It will likely not come to fruition for a few years. At the moment, I am just doing some research to educate myself and prepare appropriately. I am aware of how expensive owning a dog is, so please keep that in mind.*
   * *I will likely be fostering before actually adopting/buying a dog in the hopes of gaining more experience as a dog owner.*
   * *Also, please be nice to me. I am very nervous. : )*
2. Feel free to ask any questions below. 
   * *I’d like to hear about your experiences with different breeds and the temperaments you've witnessed. The AKC describes many dogs, but I feel real testimonies often differ. (For example, my family’s poodles have always been notorious couch potatoes despite the AKC classifying them as 4/5 on the energy need.)*
   * *I would greatly appreciate it if the community could recommend videos you found helpful for dog training and tips as well as tips you'd wished you'd known from the beginning.*

*Thank you for reading. : )*",1,1726549741.0
New rescue- does it get easier??,"Some of you might remember my post last week asking for opinions on adopting older dog.

Well, I brought the dog home to foster-to-adopt while he finishes heartworm treatment.  He is a beautiful, sweet golden retriever mix who just wants to be loved.  It felt like all the signs were there and the timing just fell into place. 

Unfortunately, my little poodle mix seems to have missed that memo.  I think I underestimated (or maybe just tried to forget) how fear reactive he can be.  The shelter staff warned me that it could take several weeks of working with them.  It’s only day 2 and I’ve seen some TINY signs of progress.  We’ve reached the point of calmly coexisting in separate rooms, and the poodle seems to be a tiny bit braver about approaching the gate.  But we have miles to go.  I ventured into the reactive dogs sub, and now I’m wondering if he’ll ever really adjust.  There’s a LOT I could’ve been working on with him before bringing another dog into the home.

Like I said, it’s day 2 and I’m willing to keep working.  I just have this sinking feeling that I’m not giving either dog what they really need from me.  They both want my attention all the time, but I can’t be in 2 places at once.  I feel bad for making the poodle scared in his own home, I feel bad that I can’t give my undivided attention to helping the new dog get settled in.  And I hate the thought of being the second foster-to-adopt home to return this amazing boy to the animal shelter.  I don’t want to give up too early but I also want to do right by both dogs.

I‘m just exhausted.  Exhausted from trying to keep both dogs happy and loved, exhausted from being woken up at 4 AM by a giant goober who wants to wrestle and shred my blankets, and exhausted from trying to figure all this out.  I knew it would take work, but I didn’t fully realize just how MUCH work.

Part of me thinks it‘s only day 2 and far too early to throw in the towel, and the other part of me thinks I’ve made a huge mistake.  Honestly, does it get easier, or is the writing on the wall?",1,1730943167.0

What dog would suit me?,"Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. Experience with a Shar Pei. Raised it to be non aggressive, basic commands. Now how to act around dogs and be assertive but kind too. I'm willing to push myself further this time as I was younger when I first got my Shar Pei and attend training classes.

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

Breeder ideally, open to shelters.

Describe your ideal dog.

A dog with a unique distinct personality. A dog being naturally aloof, quieter, etc is not something I see as a personality flaw but a welcome part of the breed as long as it does not venture into any unwanted behaviours. 

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Shar Peis are the love of my life, but given the health conditions and other problems, I'm unsure if I'll get another. 

Breeds I'm considering.

- English Bull Terrier

- Rottweiler

- Chow Chow

- Boxer

- Akita

- Mastiffs

Not interested in Labradors, Golden Retrievers.

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

The basics, sit, come, follow, stop, drop it, no food aggression, paw. Not too into tricks if the dog wouldn't want too, but basic commands definitely.

Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No.

Care Commitments

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

As much as they want really. I am used to having an aloof Shar Pei who preferred their own space and solitude. But I'm happy to spend a lot of time interacting and playing with my dog.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Multiple hours on my days off, which vary. Four days some weeks. Two on others. An hour or so when I'm working. Will try make up for it more on the off days by going to more far places. It'll all vary really, some days will be a quick walk around the area a few times through the day to make up his exercise, others will be long days out. In maybe two years should have a bit of garden space too and  there'll always be someone to let them in and out. Less if it's what the dog wants or needs, i.e avoiding over exertion in Mastiffs.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I'll do whatever it takes for the right breed.

Personal Preferences

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium ideal. Or lower large end. Whilst Mastiffs are huge, it's more the exercise commitments I'm thinking about rather than overall size.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Unbothered.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Don't want to do this.

Dog Personality and Behavior

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Can handle either. do want a dog that wants to play.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Somewhere inbetween.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Aloof but friendly to strangers is fine.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

If necessary.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Not really.

Lifestyle

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

It'll vary. One of us works mondays 9-5 and the other works shifts. There'll be days where it can be around 6-7 hours, but others where it's only 2. And a lot of the time, someone will be off work in the week days so there'll be 4 days a week, maybe 3 on average where they are not home alone.                                   

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Two people looking after and very involved, two a bit distant but okay with dogs. Other two aren't mentioned in the care commitments but will often be in the house.


20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Unaffected.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

UK.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

0-10 winters. 15-30 summers, heatwaves aside.

Future breeds to look into,"
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will not be my first dog. I have owned 1 dog, who is my current dog. He’s a black lab, and his training is basic, essentially just sit, stay, lay, etc.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I prefer a reputable breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Medium to X-large (prefer large to XL), occasional to seasonal shedding, low maintenance, low to medium energy. Friendly, good with young kids, good natured, doesn’t need attention 24/7. Just a friendly companion, and I wouldn’t mind some guarding instincts to help protect the family

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Mastiffs (as a whole, not a specific mastiff)- XL, generally lower energy, cuddly/affectionate with family, natural guarding instincts

How Much is Nature v Nurture in Dog Traits?,"We currently have 2 aging dogs - a GSD and a GSP. My husband adores our GSP, while I tend to favor our German shepherd. Both were adopted as adults dogs.

When discussing our next dog, which will be purchased from a reputable breeder, we are torn. 

My husband appreciates the affection & athleticism of our GSP. We both run, so we love the endurance, and how he cuddles up with us and our toddlers.

I appreciate the trainability of our shepherd - she waits on commands, while our GSP is more independent / exploratory.

However, our shepherd is protective of our kids, to the point where she will occasionally bark at babysitters in the home if they don't have an assertive personality. Never aggressive with them, but bossy. 

I lean towards getting a shepherd puppy, while my husband would prefer a pointer/Irish Setter/Rhodesian Ridgeback. We don't have Ridgeback or setter experience. 

Will we see a huge difference in shaping a dog's behavior when we purchase a puppy instead of adopting an adult dog? Or does the breed we choose play such a big a difference? ",1,1727375380.0

Lancaster buys puppy from puppy mills like Greenfield ,"
A Trip Around Lancaster, PA: Our Visit to Six Breeders Selling Puppies Online
Recently, Stop Online Puppy Mills took a trip to Lancaster County, PA, to visit six licensed dog breeders selling puppies online. What we found behind the beautiful homes and pristine exteriors was a troubling reality for the dogs bred and sold at these facilities. Here’s what we uncovered during our eye-opening journey.

Dachshund Puppies with Mange Around the Eyes
At one young breeder’s home, we were greeted with the sight of dachshund puppies with mange around their eyes. These poor puppies had hair loss around the eyes and in spots on their heads. While the puppies were presented to us in a pen in the front yard, it was clear they were not receiving proper care.

The puppies were being sold for $1,200 and when we asked about the hair loss he explained it was from nursing, despite the fact that the puppies had been weened and were eating sold food. When we asked to see the mother dog and where she lived, the breeder refused, citing concerns about “disease.”

Fad Colored French Bulldog Puppies with No Health Testing
One of the online sellers listed a litter of “fad-colored” French Bulldogs. These colors are non standard colors including blue eyes. Breeders selling puppies with these colors are considered irresponsible, exploiting the breed and careless in breeding practices by the French Bulldog Club of America.

What truly caught our attention was the heartbreaking condition of their mother. She was only 3 years old but had already been bred five times, the breeder said she was a good momma. Her coat was patchy with visible hair loss and poor confirmation. The most disturbing moment came when the breeder held her down by the scruff of her neck, forcing her head flat against the ground, explaining she wasn’t used to being outside of her cage. The contrast between her miserable mental and physical conditions and the $2,000 price tag on her puppies was a chilling reminder of the cruelty that hides behind the beautiful websites selling puppies online.

CK6 Breeders with Over 500 Dogs
Two of the largest breeders we visited each housed over 500 dogs according to their licenses. These breeders primarily supplied puppies to pet stores, but with pet store sales slowing down, they both started selling their puppies directly to the public, “retail” via online platforms. Because they do not use electricity or modern technology, they candidly spoke about how the online platform send photographers to take high-quality photos of the puppies. The photos, combined with made up names and descriptions of each puppy, are then uploaded online by the platform to entice buyers.

While the websites looked polished and professional, we were not allowed to look inside the several buildings that housed the dogs, again with the excuse of potential disease spreading. This lack of transparency raises serious questions about the conditions of these dogs.

A Chicken Farmer, A Heifer Farmer, and A Mumm Farmer
Among the breeders we visited, three farmers who primarily raised chickens, cows, and mums (flowers), also ran profitable dog breeding businesses on the side. Despite their other farming operations, these breeders still sold puppies online as an additional lucrative source of income. The chicken farmer had over 100 dogs in his breeding kennel along with housing and record keeping violations. The heifer farmer had close 300 dogs in his kennel along with direct violations stating untreated painful eye injuries on multiple dogs. The mumm farmer was selling high priced designer dogs as a lucrative side income.

Each had set up a room in their home where families could meet the puppies. However, when asked to meet the mother dogs or see inside the breeding buildings, we were told no—again citing “disease” as the reason for denying access. It was clear that these puppies were being sold as commodities, no different than the other livestock or goods these farmers produced.

Timid and Lethargic Puppies
At all six breeders we visited, we encountered puppies that were timid, lethargic, and appeared visibly unhealthy. Many were thin, with dull coats and clear signs of emotional distress. Some puppies cowered behind furniture, barely acknowledging our presence, revealing a stark lack of proper socialization. Despite the farmers’ children being present in an attempt to create an atmosphere of care, the puppies’ withdrawn behavior told a different story. Some were energetic but noticeably underweight and small. We were concerned about the physical and emotional well-being of all of the puppies we saw, not to mention their mother and fathers.

Selling “Retail” to the Public
Interestingly, two of the large breeders openly admitted that they had resorted to selling “retail”—directly to the public online—because their pet store partners were not selling their puppies fast enough. To these breeders, the puppies were openly just inventory. They mentioned that the website gives them sheets on each puppy that lists the puppy’s online name and pertinent information about the puppy so they know which puppy the family is calling about. The websites also provide the breeders sheets to show the public and a folder if the puppy is sold. One breeder showed us a page that included a QR code in the sale package so customers can leave reviews right from their phones. He was proud to say the reviews go directly to his online profile, further perpetuating the illusion of legitimacy.

Beautiful Homes, Breeding Buildings, Hidden Cruelty
One of the most shocking aspects of our visits was how these breeders lived in beautifully kept updated remodeled homes, with spacious rooms dedicated to hosting potential puppy buyers. On the surface, it looked like a responsible breeding operation. But beneath the surface, these breeders were hiding the truth: we were repeatedly denied access to the mother dogs and the breeding buildings where the mother dogs and other breeding stock dogs were kept. This stark contrast between the charming public-facing rooms and the unseen reality of the breeding dogs and buildings were deeply unsettling.

What We Learned
These breeders represent a large part of the puppy-selling industry—using the appeal of their simple heritage, picturesque homes, and friendly fronts to sell puppies online. However, they carefully control what buyers see, creating an illusion of transparency while hiding the grim realities of large-scale breeding operations. Driven by profit, the health and well-being of the dogs are secondary, and even though buyers may feel reassured by clean rooms and friendly breeder interactions, they are not seeing the whole picture.

Stop Online Puppy Mills is committed to educating the public about these deceptive practices and how high volume commercial dog breeders sell puppies online hiding behind beautiful websites. These breeders, who are supposed to be caring for the animals in their charge, are profiting from their suffering. When buyers purchase puppies online, they are often unknowingly supporting this system of exploitation.",1,1731966069.0

Frozen Kong question,"I have been freezing kongs with my dog's fresh food and other snacks in them for years. We moved in July and I misplaced her kongs and just found them (used slow feeder and ice trays in between). I started filling and freezing her kongs again, and lately, she has less interest in them. It seems that it's specific to them being frozen. I was taught that frozen is good because it lasts longer and is a little bit more difficult for her. It's also more convenient for me to make them all on the weekend and then freeze them. Can anyone think of any reason why she doesn't want them frozen? I brushed her teeth last night (do often) but will take another look to see if there's anything concerning.

Dog is barking when alone and bothers our neighbors ,"Hi! I’m getting real desperate and fear being kicked out and losing all my deposit, any help is greatly appreciated!! (sorry for formatting)

My [21M] dog is a 10 year old male bichon frise, we’ve been together since he was a pup. Last month we have technically ran away from our family and been living in a flat with 2 acquaintances. I work 9 hours in retail, takes around 12 with all the travel, between 4-6 days a week. The past days have been just walking with him, work, walking with him and having dinner together, i take him with myself on dates and all that when i have the day off. 

The issue is that he barks when alone. Obviously it’s my and my parents fault for not teaching him to stay silent and calm when he was small. I am insanely busy and broke now. I am clueless as to what to do because it bothers my neighbors, they have a baby, of course right by our shared wall and they like to threaten me with having me kicked out for this. Although i don’t think this is that much out of the ordinary for an apartment complex, i am well aware he shouldn’t be doing this and he’s annoying. 

My room is finally safe for him so i have left him free in the room, before that he was in his travel box, which he was used to but it obviously is awful for him. Turns out this makes him bark more. 

I want to teach him but that’s a really slow process. What could i do in the meantime that would still allow us to eat for the month? I’ve been looking at ways to sound proof the room or maybe get him a bigger kennel that could be more easily ‘soundproofed’ but i heard it doesn’t work well for noises as loud as barking.

Breed help please!!,"**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** 
Top choice is dachshund. From what I’ve read they seem to be affectionate and cuddly, which I am looking for. I also enjoy find them very cute. have started researching miniature poodles due to their intelligence and train ability. 

**What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?** 

I’d like my dog to be someone who keeps me active- I work from home and would like a friend to go out for daily walks and potentially weekend adventures. But the affection is important to me as well.  

**What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?** Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?

I have been a dog sitter for about 3 years with my longest boarding being under 2 weeks. I’ve dogsat puppies that need to taken to the bathroom multiple times throughout the night to senior dogs. I’ve sat papillions, standard poodles, labs, shih tzu, and chihuahuas. I prefer to have smaller-medium sized breeds. 

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?** If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they? 

No

**Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?** 

No

**Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?** What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?

I am currently renting in an apartment and plan to stay here for the next couple of years at minimum. Right next door is a large field that I see many owners exercising their dogs in. No weight or breed restrictions. 

**Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?** How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?

Myself and my partner. I will be main caretaker and my partner is excited. 

**How often do you have visitors to your home?**

Not often- 1x a month if that. 

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?** 

I’d prefer to go through a reputable breeder but open to shelters. 

**Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?** 

I’d prefer a puppy. I plan to invest a lot of time into training my dog and think bonding with them from puppyhood would be important. 

**What size dog are you looking for?** [Here is a size chart for your convenience.](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)
 
36 inches tall max. Prefer small (not tiny) to medium size. My partner and I are not comfortable with a large dog. 

**How much barking is too much barking?** 

Some barking is fine but I live in an apartment, do not want to piss off my neighbors if I can. 

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do?**

A few times a week maximum. Prefer a dog that requires less brushing though. 

**How much shedding do you think you can handle?** Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.

Some shedding is fine- prefer a dog with shorter hair. 

**Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?** 

I am open to doing all at home - also willing to pay for professional grooming as needed. 

**How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?** 

I do not like slobber. Everyone farts right? Not sure how I feel about it lol. 

**How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?** 

As I plan to train my dog well, I’d like them to be eager to please. If they are somewhat independent that is fine- just worried if they are very stubborn. 

**What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?** 

I want them to know all basic commands and if possible, to be able to have them off leash with proper recall. 

**Is there any behavior you can’t accommodate?** 

Not sure if this counts as not accommodating but I am worried about extreme aggression/reactiveness and separation anxiety. Some of the reason I am leaning toward breeder vs shelter. 

**How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?** 

It’s pretty important to me but not a deal breaker. 

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?** 

Maybe 1.5hr a day walking and exercise with toys like throwing balls. I live in tri-state area so worried about exercising in the winter.

**How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?** 

Maybe an hour? I work from home so my schedule is easier. 

**Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?** 

I plan to crate train. If I feel comfortable with letting them freely roam the apartment I would. 

**How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?** 

Likely 1-2 hours during the weekday so I can go to the gym. On weekends maybe a few hours and if longer I can leave at my parents house. 

**If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?** 

I’d likely hire a dog walker but I wfh. 

**What is the general location in which you live?** You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume you’re somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).

NY

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?** Please indicate Celsius or Fahrenheit and the climate of places you may likely live in the future.

Summer:80-90F Winter 20-30F

**On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?**

9- I have wanted to get a dog since 5 years ago but have held off to wait for a time where I am more established and ready for this. I am nervous but excited!

**Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?** 

Yes!!",1,1728246003.0

I’ve Screwed Myself Over,"Long story short, this year has been horrendous. My dad died, my grandma died, my cat died, my SIL has cancer, my income dropped, one roommate moved for work and just stopped paying, and another I had to kick out because it was not good, and I was being taken advantage of (trying to help a friend who needed a place). I have fallen so behind on my bills, and I’m just not sure what else to do. I have a decent income (~$100k) but I’m so late on my payments that it seems impossible to catch up. I’m current on my mortgage, HOA, and utilities. I’m behind on all debt payments (which total $64k—about $3k behind). I had already worked out hardship plans but still can’t afford those. I have two side hustles but have been so depressed that I haven’t been able to motivate myself to work on them… I’ve already ruined my credit… it was 843 and now it’s 476. Should I try to catch up or declare bankruptcy? Do I have any other options? 

Edited with numbers:
Monthly take home pay, after 22% is taken out for my pension, which is the minimum I can have taken out: $5,406, but I’ve lost about $1,500 a month for 5/7 of the last months
Mortgage/Home Ins./Property Tax: $2,806 (rent is about $300-400 a month cheaper where I live if I were to sell and stay in same area, one of the cheapest where I live)
HOA: $109
Power: $102
Water: $60
Internet: $80
Cell Phone: $53
Car Ins. $145
Gas: $90
Monthly Subscriptions: $18
Groceries/Housewares: $350
Eating Out: $350
Pets: $100
Misc: $100 (hair cut, makeup, feminine products, clothes, etc)
Roth: $400 (on pause currently) 

It doesn’t look scary until you factor in that I have missed pay significantly more than usual this year due to everything going on in my life, so you can see how I got behind on credit cards. 

Here are my debts:
Credit Cards: $52,000, minimums: $1,300, interest: 6-10% (I’ve negotiated this twice)
Personal Loan: $9,000, minimum: $330, interest: 8%

I’m 3 months behind in a week, so about $5,000. More than I thought 😩

As far as family goes, I don’t have any help or support. My dad had a will, according to what he told me the night before he passed, but when I ask my step mom about it she won’t answer me and literally changes the subject (I finally asked if he left me literally anything—even just a tshirt or a massage gun, and she still avoids answering). It’s on my list to call a probate attorney, but I literally have no clue what the deal is. It’s hard to imagine he didn’t leave me anything; he and I were super close, and he was a surgeon, but my step mom is… interesting? She and her sister are still fighting over their mom’s will, and her mom passed 5 years ago. I don’t really know anything beyond that. The lawyers I’ve talked to all said I can write a note to include in my file if I declare bankruptcy. 

I am usually really good with money and super motivated. I worked 3 jobs for 12 years to pay off student loans and then saved another $85k to buy a house on a conventional loan in a high cost of living state to be close to my family. Prior to this happening, I had never had an overdraft on my bank account and never paid a bill late. I know how to get out of debt, but I guess I just don’t know what else to do to get caught back up. I’m burnt out and depressed (don’t worry too much—I have multiple degrees in this area and know what I need to do). I’ll get there, but I’m thick in the grief process right now, and this isn’t helping. I had a 3 month emergency fund, but I ended up going through that when I was roommateless. I would prefer NOT to rent out my spare bedroom. I have had the worst experiences this year.

I have talked to my financial planners, and they recommend bankruptcy if I can qualify for a chapter 7. I would keep my house and car according to laws in my state. I don’t anticipate needing credit for anything in the near future as I already have a house and reliable vehicle; honestly, at this point, I think my credit would be fixed faster if I did either form of bankruptcy. At least bankruptcy would restructure everything and get me caught up. I obviously am torn about doing this since I keep delaying it and trying to figure out another way—including here. I feel like such a failure.

ANOTHER EDIT: I COULD pull $5k from my Roth IRA to catch up and take the tax hit (I got a big refund last year). Ugh. IDK!

Advice on buying a house from a friend,"Hey everyone, throwaway account here...

My partner and I have two middle school kids and have been renting a house from a ""friend"" for the past 4 years since they moved out and needed tenants during COVID. I say ""friend"" because we've drifted apart but nothing negative has happened. We love the place and after renting for 20+ years we'd like to settle down. We want to find a deal that works well for both of us. Here's the situation:

* **The House:** Located in a now-desirable (gentrified) neighborhood, purchased for $300k in 2008, now worth about $1 million.
* **Our Finances:** Gross income of $200k this year, expecting a $200k work bonus next year and could use $100k for down payment. Partner going to start generating income next year. $20k in the bank. No credit card debt. $500/mo car payment.
* **History:** We've been renting this house for 4 years at $3,500-$3,600/month and have been excellent tenants.
* **Our Goal:** Buy the house so that we can settle down and make it our own - it has huge potential. We also want to make it beneficial for both parties.

We're exploring options like:

* **Straightforward purchase with a first time homebuyer mortgage:** A little below market value since we're saving them realtor fees.
* **Owner financing:** Potentially at 5% interest??
* **Rent-to-own:** Lock in a contract for either of the above with an option to purchase, while we wait for the bonus.

My questions for you:

* What are the pros and cons of each option for both us and the seller?
* How can we structure a deal that's truly win-win?
* Is 5% owner financing attractive in this market/next year? What are the benefits for the seller beyond the lower rate?
* Any other creative solutions we haven't considered?

Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",0,1732033302.0

Which dog for my family?,"Hey all, been a dog lover all my life. Grew up with an Afghan Hound, had a Basset, and two Dachshunds. My old girl passed in June, and we have our senior weiner still with us. 

We've just bought a new home with 3.5 acres of wooded property along a shallow (mostly shin-knee deep) river. It's a beautiful place, and we're really excited to start this chapter.  My wife and I have two little girls, ages four and two.

We're looking for a dog to bring into the family in the spring, and would like some thoughts from knowledgeable folks on what breeds may fit our situation. We're a moderately active family, and our children are very loving and respectful of the dogs. With the new property, we have a couple campsites and a cabin on the property, trails throughout, and plenty of forest and river bank. 

I'm looking for a dog that can be in the bush with me, but also flop on the couch with the kids. It would spend an average of about 2.5 hours a day alone, during the week, as my wife and I work opposite shifts, and the kids would be at school/daycare. Having owned hounds my whole life, i'm used to the stubbornness that comes with them, but also am very open to a dog with excellent recall. A breed that can be relaxed and lay with you at your side at a bonfire without taking off would be lovely, as well.

Would prefer short to medium coat, and as little shedding as possible. 

I'm probably going to get a lot of lab/golden retreiver suggestions, here, and believe me, we've discussed them both at length. Looking for other suggestions we may not be considering at the moment. 

For reference, I'm partial to a bluetick and redbone coonhounds, as well as american foxhounds. 

Thanks so much for any and all advice

Post-surgery anti-boredom ideas,"Long story short my dog was on an exercise restriction while healing for the last 2 weeks but just had said injury reopen and after getting it restitched she's been put on another exercise restriction for 4 weeks this time

When to upgrade credit card/ when to stop using a starter/ student card?,"So i've had this student credit card to establish credit. I've now established my credit score and have had a jet blue card for over a year as well.

I know that you should never close a line of credit since it would wipe out my credit history, but at what point should i stop using that card in favor of better cards? Should i be using my jetblue card over my student card?

Also thinking about getting a new card soon that will offer better cashback benefits on a daily basis. All my google searches just tell me not to close my credit lines (that is not my question)

Just checking to see if I'm doing the right thing with my finances. Mid to late 30s living with my parents. ,"Didn't start working until very late in life. My goals are to have enough for a car and a down payment on a home, and to establish long term plans.

Paying ahead on car loan questions,"Okay so I have a car loan through Wells Fargo Auto. A few months ago I decided to start putting extra money towards the loan to pay it off faster. According to Wells Fargo, the policy states - “extra payments will go towards next month’s balance, once you are 3 months ahead the due date will stop advancing, and any payments will then go towards principle only.” So that’s where I’m at now. My due date is in February but I still plan on making monthly payments in order to pay the loan off faster. I just made my monthly payment today, and it all went towards principal. But my question is, what happens to all the interest in the meantime? Since I didn’t pay any interest this month, is it going to be accruing for three months until February? And then I’ll have just a bunch of interest due? If I keep paying ahead, will I just pay a bunch of interest all at once at the end of the loan? I know principal only payments will reduce overall interest paid, but I just don’t understand what’s happening to the interest now while I’m making these principal only payments.

Questions on how to best invest some money for my mother,"Good day!

I honestly know little about investing, but realizing I really need to learn for myself and family.

Currently I am looking to re-invest some money for my mom. An annuity of hers recently matured and she was recommended by her advisor to put it back into another annuity to avoid taxes/fees for now. From what I understand, you can do a 1035 into a new annuity and all the money gets transferred, no taxes or fees get subtracted.

Is this a good idea or should she be looking at something other than another annuity (even if she has to pay taxes to get the money out)? She made a decent return on this last one and doesn't need immediate access to this money (about $300k) - she is really just looking for a place to put it so it grows and doesn't just sit there.

Her house is paid for and she has few monthly expenses and checking/savings accounts that should have more than enough to support her.

Right now her advisor recommended a New York Life Premier VA and a Brighthouse Shield Level II VA. I am not hearing a lot of positives on VAs so was just wondering good alternatives for someone with money already in a matured VA and is just looking for a conservative way to grow that money for a few years.

Any recommendations. Please let me know if anything I mentioned doesn't make sense of if more info is needed. Thank you.",0,1732314300.0
Dog started refusing morning walks,"Our 3yo Bichon Frise, who has always enjoyed long morning walks (30-45 mins on weekdays and 1.5-2 hours on weekends), has recently started refusing them. Since I got pregnant, my activity level has decreased, and our morning walks have shortened to about 20 mins on weekdays and 45 mins on weekends. I also started working from the office, leaving less time for walks on weekdays.

Since then his behavior has changed significantly: he's more whiny, begs for attention, pulls on walks, and is stubborn about the direction he wants to walk in. We're trying mental enrichment at home, but it only helps a little. More notably, he often refuses to leave the driveway for morning walks, happily following me back inside instead. If we skip the morning walk, he stays home alone all day without going outside until the evening walk.

Despite this, he eats, plays, and takes evening walks as usual, showing excitement for those. Should I just ignore this change in behavior? It’s like in the mornings he says “meh, these crappy walks are not even worth getting out of bed for”.",1,1729096469.0
22 y.o. $64k lawsuit settlement ,"I am 22F. I was hit by a drunk driver, after my lawyer took 1/3 of my settlement and I paid hospitals I am left with $64k. I live with my parents and go to a community college nursing school with only $4k student loan debt. I plan to pay off my car which is $19k. I would like to give my parents $2k because they have helped me with a lot of bills during this time. That will leave me with about $40k. What should I do with the rest? 

My thought was put some of it in a HYSA and pretend I don’t have it. I know nothing about stocks and don’t want to do anything risky with this. This could change my life and I’m very thankful. 

Additional questions: should I continue to take out student loans for the remainder of my schooling? (I have 2 semesters left which will be about $4k more in loans. Total at the end of school: 8k) The loans do not have interest until 6 months after I graduate. I should easily be able to pay them off before then.

More info that could be useful: I live in Ohio and plan to move towards the outskirts of the Columbus area once I have a job as a nurse in about a year. I would like to buy a home if possible, really don’t want an apartment. I have no credit card debt. Let me know if you need to know anything else. Thanks in advance.

1. My car loan is in my dad’s name and the interest rate is something like 9%. Bad. My parents are expecting me to pay this loan off with my settlement money because they can’t afford these monthly payments anymore. I had back surgery and could not work for a while + my savings were drained after the accident so they have been paying it for me. 

2. I just now got a job after almost 6 months of not being physically able to work. Being a full time nursing student I work pretty minimal hours at a minimum wage job so before this I did not have much in my savings. ",0,1731791256.0

[Breeds] Recommended breeds for first time dog owner,"**Introduction**

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes this will be my first dog on my own. I grew up my whole life with German Shepherd dogs though and have experience with caring for them on my own (albeit on a short term basis)

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
* No

3)Describe your ideal dog.

* Single guy with no kids, looking for a medium to large sized dog (50-100 lbs). Looking for an affectionate companion that I can take and enjoy exploring with (dog parks, hikes, breweries, etc), so must be friendly around people and other dogs. I also live by myself and work from an office. I have flexibility to work from home and come home for lunch breaks. But living by myself the dog will sometimes need to be home by itself for up to 8 hours, especially once we are settled into a routine.  

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Was mainly looking into labs, retreivers, along with smaller Great Pyrenees and Bernese Mountain Dogs. I am not married to these breeds though

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience commands, Go for rides in the car and go on hikes. People and other dog friendly

6)Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

7)How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Outside of work I have lots of free time at home that I can devote. We can go for a morning walk each day, plus can take the dog on an additional walk or to the dog park after work. 

8)How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* On average I would say 90 minutes a day. Plus on the weekends occassionally go on hikes (doesn't have to be difficult) or to a dog park to run around. 

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I don't mind doing all of this, but also willing to pay a professional if neccessary. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)What size dog are you looking for?

* 50 - 100 lbs

11)How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I don't mind shedding at all and slobber I can handle. Barking is ok but I'd like to be able to let the dog out in my back yard (fenced in) without constant barking at the neighbors dogs.

12)How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I don't have a huge backyard, so I would like to be able to take the dog to the park and play fetch and let them run around. This isn't a deal breaker though. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I don't mind either. Preferably snuggly though. 

14)Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Somewhere in the middle. Independent is good but not too independent where it can't be taught to listen to basic obedience (sit, stay, come, etc)

15)How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't mind if the dog barks if someone comes to the door or enters the yard. That was a common occurrence growing up with dogs so I am used to it. Would prefer if the dog could at least be taught to not jump on strangers. 

16)Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I would prefer not too

17)Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Not having a dog that is prone to separation anxiety is a big one. Also I don't want a dog that is on the extreme high energy side. My sister has an Australian Shepherd that is a bit overwhelming to take care of. 

**Lifestyle**

18)How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Answered above, but ideally the dog will need to be left alone for up to 8 hours a day on weekdays. I have flexibility to work from home or go home lunch breaks, though. Also willing to hire a dog walker or take the dog to day care some days as well. 

19)What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* N/A

20)Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No

21)Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

22)Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Need some advice working situation and my Cattle Dog,"
So Remi is almost 5 years old and a few months ago I left a WFH job so I could earn more money to allow us to move to a more expensive state to be near family. 

Fast forward to now and I HATE my job and my boss. I barely see my family (their) issue. I have to leave Remi 8 hours a day now but hired a dog walker. I’m paying about $400 a month for that. 

I have cameras to watch Remi while I’m working but I feel so guilty. He sleeps most of the day but I really miss being with him all day. I know he feels the same because he jumps in front of me and barks like crazy as I walk to the front door. 


Basically I regret my decision all around and am trying to find a work from home job and eventually move back to the more affordable state. 

I value time with my dog and I work to live not live to work. 

So here’s where it gets complicated. I am on my 3rd interview for a job that has 25% work from home and perhaps 50% later with a 20K salary bump. 

It’s not about the money but it would help me relocate and eventually I could find a 100% WFH position. 

The travel is M-Th back home on Fri-Sun. I can hire someone to stay with Remi while I’m gone but it won’t be easy as he doesn’t always like other dogs and most people have dogs. 

Also this will be really hard on both of us but perhaps better in the long run. Sorry for the long post

Morning routine for pups?,"Hi all. I recently got a black lab puppy who really tests my limits but is the absolutely love of my life. He is 3 months old, and I am really struggling with mornings with him. He usually sleeps through the night, but lately has been whining to pee and poop between 4 and 530. He usually will settle after a bit and go to sleep until 6/630 but is absolutely crazy when he wakes up. He bites, chews everything, barks, etc. I live in New England in a wooded area so as of now when we wake up it’s still dark out and the animals are still lurking. So here is our current routine 

6/630: wake up, potty, and play - this is when he’s crazy and it can last an hour depending on the time he wakes up. I don’t even have time to pee in the morning. I wish I could let him run around at this time but I can’t. 

7: eat (half a cup in a slow feeder, the other half cup with a rolling dispenser for enrichment). Potty after eating. 

720: chewing on bones, playing, or getting into mischief. It’s light out by this time so we will usually go outside but I also need to pee, brush my teeth, make coffee, etc 

750: sit by open window and look outside 

8: train 

830: 1.5 mile walk 

9: teething time while I work 

930: first nap

Payroll and Salary Advice,"Hi,

My company is based in the US and I am in Europe. I have been receiving my salary in USD to my WIse USD account and it has worked very well so far. Now, my company said they can pay me in my local currency EUR if I want to and this would be based on an agreed fixed amount that would be adjusted for exchange rate changes every six months.  This means the salary amount will change based on the exchange rate per January 1st and remain the same for six months until June for it to be changed again (based on June exchange rate) and continue in six month cycles.

I was thinking to still receive USD as this is more under my control (I can exchange it on my own). On the other hand fixed amount can be more advantage (if exchange rate is good at the time) at the same time risky (if ex. exchange rate is blocked at a low rate for six month).

"My vet committed suicide and I’m so sad for his young family and all of the animals who will be worse off for it, including mine","It is well known that veterinary medicine has a long history of depression and suicidal ideation. The schooling is grueling and often leaves you in debt. Seeing abused or neglected animals is heartbreaking and from what I’ve gathered the human owners have been a nightmare lately. 

That said, I don’t know of many careers that make a bigger difference in society than veterinarians. My dogs arthritis is starting to get worse and I was going to call in to change her treatment plan to improve her QOL but am feeling a little lost.

I over analyze everything and frequently have buyer’s remorse,"
I don’t know what my deal is, but I tend to over analyze the vast majority of my purchases and now and then get immediate buyer’s remorse. I really don’t know why - I have a great paying job, I’m an avid YNAB user, and I never do any frivolous spending. I rarely spend money on myself. I don’t have credit card debt. But for some reason I over analyze most purchases to the point where it leaves me anxious and don’t go through with the purchase. On top of this, I get instant buyer’s remorse a lot of times.

Recent example - I was thinking it would be fun to upgrade my tv. I can absolutely afford what I was looking at, but I kept feeling guilt of “you don’t need this, the current one is fine” or “you could instead use the money towards a vacation with regroup family” and other things like that. I even went as far as placing the order, instantly became regretful, and immediately canceled the order. I felt the purchase was unnecessary and unwise, even though it was easily affordable. And then I feel like an idiot for feeling the way I do. It’s a fun cycle! 

I know this goes deeper than “I’m trying to be smart with money” and probably something I need to investigate with a therapist. But just once I’d like to be free with spending like this and not get all worked up. Even if it turned out to be a “dumb purchase” in the end, it’s not like it would impact my financial standing or bankrupt me. So why am I like this?",0,1732070133.0
Flexible retirement savings as an expat teacher in the US aiming for early retirement/part-time work?,"Hello, /r/personalfinance!

I’m a 30-year-old UK national teaching at an international school in the US, with an $80,000 annual salary. I plan to stay in the US for at least five years but might move to another country afterward, although I’m unlikely to return to the UK. My long-term financial goals center around working towards early retirement or shifting to part-time work, rather than focusing on home ownership (future moves could include accommodation as part of an employment package).

I have an emergency fund, a moderate-high risk tolerance, and my employer offers a 3% match if I contribute 6% to a 401k (I’m not currently using it). Given my potential for an international move, I’d appreciate advice on retirement savings options that allow for flexibility—whether that means taking advantage of the 401k, opening an IRA, or exploring other accounts. I’d love to hear from anyone with insights into flexible retirement planning for expats with an eye on early retirement.

Thanks in advance!",0,1731635563.0
Tips for tennis ball stealers?,"My Boston terrier & pug mix LOVES tennis balls. When he has one, he gets completely hyper focused on it. He has very good recall, both with and without treats. We often go to off leash dog walking trails and he is normally very good. However, there have been a couple of instances recently where he has sneakily stolen other dogs tennis balls. When this happens, it is impossible to get it back. He won’t even keep walking. He just lays on the ground and chews the ball and whenever I approach him he runs to a new spot. I’ve tried tempting him with treats and his own ball and nothing seems to work. I basically have to wait until I can catch him. 

Basically, is off leash walking going to be a no go from here on out, or does anyone have any tips? It would be greatly appreciated! I would hate to have to stop bringing him to this trail, he gets to swim and it it his favourite place! And bonus, he burns so much energy!",1,1729201338.0
Would you buy a home in my situation or wait?,"I don't know if I should buy a home now or wait.

I am in my early 30's. I currently gross 157k/year. My job is stable. My credit score is 805. I am single, live alone, and my monthly expenses are $2623, no debts. I have 198k in cash. My net is $8589/month, my gross is $13,097. I rent currently at ~$1500/month which will be going up by 5% when I next renew my lease in a few months. I put 6% of my gross into my 401k which my employer matches, I also max out my HSA pre-tax and put 7500 into a Roth IRA post tax every year. I live in a high income tax state so after everything this leaves me with NET of $7964 per month after taxes and retirement contributions.

I am what you would call frugal, though I don't try to be, I just have a hard time spending money. I currently live well beneath my means. I have no debt. My old car is paid off. Not counting my retirement accounts which I will not be touching for any reason for at least 30 years, I currently have 198k cash saved up rolling into 4 week Treasury bills yielding me 4.589%, this is the easily accessible cash on hand I have intended to use 150k of to purchase a home. Keeping the rest for emergency fund and job loss safety net as I have no friends or family in my life to ask for help if anything in my life goes wrong. I am adding $5341 to this pile every month.

The median price for homes in my area is 655k and they seem to be going up by 3-5% per year. Though this year they are the same as they were last year. If I bought the typical home right now putting 131k as the 20% down-payment assuming an 6.5% mortgage, (I assume if i shop around at least 3 mortgage lenders I can get a 6.5% mortgage rate since they are ~7% today) then my monthly payment will be ~$3871. This includes property taxes, homeowners insurance, mortgage interest and principle, and hoa. 

This would put my debt to income at 30%.

A payment of $3871 feels insane to me, and the Amortization schedule of the loan means I'll be paying in total 1.192 million for a 655k house, so I pay in just interest $668,333. I get that you can refinance assuming rates ever come back to earth, make extra payments, etc etc. to make this less insane.

As far as I can tell this is nearly the worst most expensive time to buy a house in the history of the housing market, and I don't need a house. I am under no pressure to buy. But I have always deeply wanted my own home and I feel like it would massively improve my quality of life. The cheaper houses under the median are very much starter homes and will require a lot of work, I'd rather get something around the median that is move in ready if I decide to buy. If I go down this path I will be a first time home buyer. The way I live right now, I should be able to continue to save around 65k cash each year if I don't buy a house. As for future relationships, I intend to remain childfree by choice. I also intend to remain in the home for at least 15 years maybe forever if I buy.

So, if you were in my situation what would you do?",0,1731878944.0

Need Advice for Student Loan Repayment,"Hi everyone, I need some personal finance advice. I'm 23yo earning \~US$80k. I'm contributing the minimum to Roth 401(k) and HSA to get the employer match. The rest of the money is all deposited in a checking account which currently holds \~$25k and that's all I have besides the 401(k) and HSA funds.

I currently have $27k in federal student loans which are in forbearance and have 0% interest under the SAVE repayment plan, but I'm not sure how long this forbearance would last. I plan to aggressively pay it off but it doesn't make sense to make payments now since it has 0% interest.

1. Where should I keep my emergency fund? It seems like money market fund is the best option.
2. Where do I keep the remaining money and the money I'll save from future paychecks, that I'll use to pay off the loan once forbearance ends? It also seems like money market fund is the best option.

I love my dog and I just wanted to share  ,"My dog showed up in our lives by chance. One day my mom called and said her and my brother were getting a dog. I was over the moon. Crying. Excited. This was a lifelong dream of mine. My husband and I had talked about getting a dog, but weren’t quite ready, so I was ecstatic when my mom said she was getting one with my brother. 
Within 3 days, they quickly realized it was a lot of work and they wouldn’t be able to handle it. She was now talking about re-homing him to someone we knew. I was devastated. I know this sounds bad, but I cried harder and was more shattered than when I found out my dad died. I don’t know what it was about this little guy, in 3 short days I had developed such a deep love for him. 
My husband couldn’t stand to see me so broken, I was crying all day and couldn’t eat. Something about the thought of giving him away made my heart feel like it was being ripped out of my chest. 
So we took him. 
That was in March, and now I’m typing this as our little 10 month old guy is snoring (like he’s worked over time all week) in between my husband and I. Puppy phase was the craziest ride of my life, some days I didn’t know how I’d get through it but man, does he make life worth living. Before him, I felt like life had no meaning, no purpose, just mundane day to day shit. Now, with him around, the mundane is wonderful. He is the best. He is sweet, silly, crazy, cuddly, stubborn, playful, protective, and smart as heck. Some days we look at him and wonder who he is. His green eyes are human-like and some days I just stare at him and cry in gratitude.  He is such a special boy and I can’t imagine a day without him. He is 3/4 beagle, 1/4 mini Australian Shepard, and 100% amazing/menace. To all of you dog lovers and dog owners, how lucky are we? Hug your pups extra tight tonight.

Today it is windy and sprinkling outside, and each time I bring her out she just stand with her tail in between her legs. I have been working hard on positively reinforcing outside with treats and praise, but she has still been struggling. Any advice is very appreciated!",1,1727785644.0
Trying to bond with an avoidant dog,"Hey Reddit, I need your help. My husband and I have been talking about getting a rescue pup for years and we started looking for a dog a couple of months ago. We met a 6-month old puppy a few weeks ago that we fell in love with on Petfinder. She came from a ""rescue"" (essentially a person hoarding 20+ dogs in their rental, who was then evicted) to the rescue she's with now and had been in foster care for 3ish weeks when we met her. Prior to that she had basically never been socialized with humans past the one caretaker, although she does REALLY well with other dogs. She was very fearful of us but had really bonded with her foster dad so we saw some hope for her, and she allowed my husband to pet her before we left.

We had decided not to adopt her but had second thoughts and worked out a foster-to-adopt with the rescue for three weeks. We're two weeks in and she has very quickly bonded with my husband, he is her absolute favorite person, she regularly asks him for affection and to be picked up, but she has really struggled to do any sort of consistent bonding with me. When she's tired in the morning and late evenings she can be so sweet and cuddly, lets me pet her, and will even let me pick her up sometimes but during the day she is completely avoidant and really doesn't want me to even touch her most of the time.

The thing is, I'm the one who really wants a dog and we intended for the dog we end up with to be more my dog than my husband's dog. I know any dog will have a favorite human and it may not be me, but the level to which she avoids me is really discouraging and I just don't know what else I can do to try to win this dog over. My husband really loves her and everyone keeps assuring us that with time she'll come to love me but I just don't know that's true based on how little progress we've made in these two weeks. I guess I'm just looking for advice on more bonding techniques, reassurance that yes she will love me some day, or an honest there's no guarantee and maybe this isn't the right dog for you.

What I really want by the end of this week is to consistently be able to pet her and ideally pick her up as she's not totally trained to go down the stairs by herself - she actually bit me early on in the foster when I had to pick her up which I admit did sour me against her a bit. I think that would give me the assurance I need to be confident in adopting her. I'll include what I've been doing to bond with her in the comments, I really appreciate any responses I get 🙏

UPDATE: The rescue has given us an additional two weeks with her on top of the initial three weeks. She's starting to warm up to me more in the past week which has been so encouraging 😊 We've basically decided to keep her as our/my husband's dog at this point, we're just meeting with a few trainers and behaviorists to get their recommendations for helping her overcome her general fearfulness to make sure we can afford any training or therapy she may need.",1,1726504904.0

Question about Cane Corso and disabled dogs ,"I don't want to use the Cane Corso sub as they are in favour of some things I can't support.

I'm interested in fostering (either life long foster or foster to adopt) a mentally disabled Cane Corso mix with mental health problems (both stemming from what was done to him before he was rescued). I seem to fit his needs and he is right up my ally and right up those problems I can deal with very well.

I'm physically disabled but see no bigger problem as I've easily managed a very ill trained mastiff in puberty that had about the same format. I've also been accidentally injured by a dog half that size snd weight because his two sole brain cells were swept into his balls by puberty and he forgot he was leashed (but still managed to safely get him and two other dogs out of the situation and walked back home). I know I have to train him well and will use security equipment (I have a belt to secure dogs that size in case I can't hold them with my arms and am a lot heavier than the dog) but that I can manage. I also have equipment to assist if his exercise needs go beyond my strength for a time (very sturdy scooter gifted to me at one of the times my health was at it's worst, also tried by the mastiff plus my late boy, I took her out with us while her owners wheelchair was broken).

For days I'm useless or when I'm in hospital my mom takes care of my dog/foster and here lies the problem. She's also easily managed the mastiff but is convinced that it wasn't so easy because she did well but because the mastiff was so in love with me (I wasn't always there when she was out and about with her). I know my mom, I know her abilities (she successfully took the exam our region requires to handle dogs that are deemed a public danger, she successfully handled the dogs I had in the past and I know the Cane Corso will steal her heart faster than she can stuff him with treats. 

Before I reassure my mother that I know she will handle him I want to have some input from others if there's anything I overlook. I know the typical character traits and behaviours of the breed and I know the specific personality, problems and features of this specific dog. He's not the smartest but eager to please which makes training a lot easier. I know they have a lot of energy and he'll probably not get much out via mental stimulation until I find the right methods for his abilities. I also know that his ""lot of energy"" is a bit below that of other's of his age and breed due to his illness and medication. He's housebroken, a sweetheart and needs to slowly learn that being alone doesn't mean he'll be abandoned and neglected again, which works well with someone who can't work and has time to work on that. He's also not a hunter and fine with other dogs. I'm yet to find out how he is with cars but that can be worked around until tackled if necessary.

Did I miss anything that might be a problem for someone else caring for him?


Edit due to misunderstandings: I do not want to convince my mom that this dog is right for her. I also do not want us to foster a dog we can't properly care for. That would suck for all three of us. I want to reassure her of her abilities and if there's no information contrary to what we found out, that she can handle him. If there's things we don't know that show she (or I) can't handle him I need to know that so I don't accidentally convince her instead of reassuring her of her abilities. I'd be totally fine if she said ""I can easily handle this dog but it's just not worth the effort to me, so let's look for a different dog."" I'd however be very sad if she thought she's ""not good enough"" to handle a dog when she is. That point is about reassuring someone who suffers from self-doubt, not about convincing someone to get a specific dog. I'll happily foster a tiny mutt again, but I don't want her to feel bad about herself.",1,1730370094.0

Question about a Puppy Barking,"Hello! this is my first post here 👋🏻

I recently got a new puppy and she is the sweetest and most active dog that I have ever had! But she is doing something that I do not know yet how to teach her that it’s not okay.

Even when I’m in the same room as her, next to her, she would start barking, or if I’m doing house chores and I’m just standing up and she is on the floor she would start barking too, or when there’s an object that makes her unable to see me (we are in the same room) she would start barking again, when I make eye contact she would stop barking but as soon as I stop giving her eye contact she would start again (?)

So I’m not sure yet how to teach her how to not do it, or I’m not even sure why is she even doing it lol

Is it worth it to max out my HSA even if I risk failing the testing period next year?,"I recently became aware of the IRS rules about pro-rating HSA contributions and the testing period. I started a job in July, and have been contributing to an HSA.

I tried to file a DOL complaint today about a company 401k plan that is mid-rollover. The DOL agent said I may have to wait until the process completes before I can submit a complaint.,"

Was the DOL agent correct when she said that I cannot submit a complaint until the company name can be found on this list?

I couldn’t tell if the agent was being callous and dismissive or if there’s truly no way for me to submit a complaint at this time.

My former employer told me that I was getting kicked off of the company plan so I would be “on my own” after the rollover. He said that previously “my money was insured because I was ‘under him’”, but after the rollover, my money wouldn’t be insured. Is this a thing?

And the complaint I am making this not about him kicking me off the plan. I don’t give a hoot about that.  What I have a problem with is my former employer suddenly alleging that my 401k account, and the company plan, never existed at all.

I’m worried because after the rollover completes can I even submit a complaint, or will it be too late?

Let me know what you guys think!

I refuse to let this douchebag win.

Asking some advice on investing in a business,"Hi all!

I am looking into investing into a dentistry practice, that is worth 200 000

I will be working in the clinic with another dentist, I'll be doing one week a month, he will be doing four (he's the one who built the business)

We are looking for a way to do this fair

Scenario 1 would be me buying 50% for 100 000 and working there a week a month, he will be working for four weeks. That would mean none of us draws a salary and we split the dividents 50-50 at the end of the year

Scenario 2 would be me buying 25% and work there a week a month when he works the full four, no one draws a salary but we split the dividents 25-75 at the end of the year

Scenario 3 would be me buying 50%, work the same pattern, but we both draw a salary, my salary will be for the time worked, his salary will be for the full month, and then whatever's left at the end of the year, we split 50-50

Breed for me?,"**Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. I had a Miniature Schnauzer that had to be put down due to aggression. He would fly into rages and bite with no provocation.  I worked with two different trainers and a canine behaviorist without ever being able to get on top of it. He was a puppy mill dog (a relatively nice mill, but still a mill) so I think that he had a genetic tendency to aggression. I suppose it’s also possible that he had been abused before I got him at eight weeks. It broke my heart, but I opted to have him put to sleep after multiple bite incidents and years of living on pins and needles. It’s been twelve years since then, and I’m only now feeling ready to have a dog again

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

No.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

Happy and outgoing. Loves everybody. Enjoys cuddle time but can chill when I’m busy. Good with children. (I homeschool for a family with four children and would love to take my dog to work with me.) Relatively low energy but loves a good walk. Small (under 20 pounds) without being too fragile. Has a coat I can maintain at home. From a generally healthy breed. Easy to train. Low prey drive (I have birds).

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Havanese, Tibetan Spaniel, Shih Tzu, English Toy Spaniel, and Japanese Chin are at the top of my list. I think they come the closest to matching my ideal dog, though each breed misses some areas. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels look like the perfect match on paper, but I’m very concerned about the health issues in the breed.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

A few tricks could be fun, but I just want a well-mannered companion.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Up to two hours of focused training, walking, and grooming.  But I would expect to be interacting with the dog all day and would certainly be happy to add in extra play time.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Up to an hour of walk time, split over two or three sessions. I plan on primarily walking my dog, plus play time. No to dog parks – I live in a rural area and there aren’t any close.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am happy to brush every day if needed. I can do basic grooming at home. I doubt I’m up to giving a dog a haircut, though. I’d prefer to avoid going to a groomer but would be willing to if my perfect dog needs regular clipping.

 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Preferably under 20 pounds.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

No drooling, please! Moderate shedding is fine, and I don’t mind some barking, if it isn’t constant.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It would be nice, but not a priority.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Some of both? I do want some snuggle time, but I don’t want a dog that will constantly pester me for attention. I wouldn’t mind my dog lying quietly on my lap or beside me while I work, but I’d hate to have to keep stopping to interact with it.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

More eager-to-please.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

With a wagging tail! I also don’t mind a more reserved dog, if it isn’t at all aggressive. I’m pretty scarred from my past experience, so I’m trying to stack the deck in my favor with a dog that loves everyone.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Any hint of aggression toward people.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Two or three hours a couple of times per week. I plan to take my dog to work with me, plus, I live with my retired parents, so someone is almost always at home.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

I will be the dog’s caregiver. My father would probably enjoy any well-mannered dog. My mother would prefer a dog that can chill out and not be constantly pestering her for attention.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

I have budgies. They spend several hours each day out of their cage, so prey drive is a big concern.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes. My niblings are in and out of the house frequently, plus I’d like to take my dog to work with me (I homeschool for a family). All the children are used to interacting with dogs and are good with them.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Not applicable.

Adopting 1? Or 2 puppies?,"Hi. My family and I were looking into adopting 2 puppies, but im not quite sure if we should adopt 1 or 2 siblings right away? Whats the easier transition? Should we get 1, wait months or a year and then get another? Thank you!! ",1,1728757143.0
How important are you to your dog?,"You mean a lot for your dog, for example :



1. If you got your dog as a puppy (from a breeder, friend, or family), you are 95% of your dog's memories.



2. If you got your dog from a shelter, you’re the first person they could truly trust—the one who showed them what real love and loyalty feel like.



3. If you adopted a dog from an owner who couldn’t take care of them anymore—maybe the owner was elderly, very ill, or passed away—you’re the one who brought them happiness again after losing someone deeply important to them.



4. If you took in a stray, you’re the one who turned their whole world around. One day, they were on their own, and the next, they had you as family. To them, you’re a life-changing miracle.



5. If your dog came from a tough or traumatic situation—whether they faced owners that ignored their needs, violent owners, or something unexpected like surviving a fire or terrible accident—you’re the person who finally showed them safety and comfort. You’re not just home to them; you’re the reason they believe good things can still happen.



6. If you adopted a dog with unique challenges—maybe they have a disability, an illness, or they were deeply scared at first—you’re the one who helps them realize they’re not only lovable but also perfect in your eyes, just as they are.

Emergency fund recommendations ,"
Good morning all,

I am a federal worker with small kids who has recently come into some unexpected cash.  I'd like to park it somewhere safe as an emergency fund for the sole purpose of government shutdown(s).  My goal isn't to be political here, but not getting paid for about 45 days was pretty damned uncomfortable in 2019 and that was before I had kids.  I'm confident that I'd still have a job even if they decide to do what they've said in reducing the federal workforce by some crazy percentage because I have a job that needs to get done somehow or bad and newsworthy things happen quickly.  

If/when we shutdown again my goal isn't to remain comfortable, but pay the necessary bills to keep my lights on and food on the table as we belt tighten as this isn't exactly a windfall.  So it needs to be liquid enough to be accessible within a week or so, but while we're at it make some money with it.  

I am thinking a HYSA or just parking it in a bond fund within my existing brokerage account.  I'm totally open to other ideas and that's why I am here.

Yes, I know the need for emergency fund stuff, but due to other life circumstances those have been recently  depleted and have shown us the need for a change.  

Thank you in advance",0,1731775377.0
Responsible Labrador breeders in Australia,"I'm on the hunt for a Labrador puppy that has undergone extensive socialisation as a puppy and has a health tested and proven set of parents. I'm willing to travel anywhere in Australia to get one but I'm based in Sydney. 

I've been combing through Dogs Online and the breed clubs of every state to compare them to the guide here and it's like a needle in a haystack. I've found some promising leads and shot off some emails but I was hoping someone here might have a lead even though it's a long shot. 

I found one that looks amazing and she tried to tell me that reactivity is 100% a learned behaviour and not partly genetic and all I needed to do was socialise and train the puppy correctly and all dogs love to train. That is NOT true and my poor gone GSD is a testament to that. 

So please Labrador owners of Australia, tell me where you got your amazing pups. ",1,1726952524.0

Financial Advise - Paying off Debts and Investing. ,"Really just looking for advice on how to tackle debts and invest. Wife and I really want to power pay off **ALL** of our debts over the next few years, but also while doing so start setting money aside into investments to help grow our money instead of it just sitting in our savings.

DEBTS:

* Car: $28,000 (edit: 6.49% interest)
* My Student Loans: \~$17,000
* Wife Student Loans: \~$50,000

We bring home roughly $110,000/year after taxes.

We have $28,000 in savings

I have $16,000 in my TSP, however I would like to transfer it over to my 401k since I am no longer in the military.

I have $2600 in my 401k, this isn't much but I just got out of the military in May so this is really just since then. I match my company with 6% per paycheck. I have also switched my investments to more aggressive funds than what they were as default investments. I also think I may up my contribution to 10%, I don't think I'll really miss the extra 4% out of my paychecks.

My wife has about $10,000 in her 401k.

BILLS per month:

* Rent: $1800
* Gas: $30-$50
* Electricity: $100-$300, ya'll know how electric bills go.
* Car Payment: $445
* Hulu Live: $77
* Storage Unit: $129
* Internet: $68
* Phone: $157
* Car/Renters Insurance: $219
* My Student Loans: No Payment as of right now, will start in Feb 2025
* Wife Student Loans: $300
* Childcare: $650
* Grocery: \~$1,000 (we nearly exclusively shop at Aldi and are usually around $110/week, plus a monthly trip to Sam's Club)
* Gas (for cars): \~$200
* One thing we KNOW we can reduce is eating out. Something so many of us struggle with.

We have a decent sum of money really just sitting in our savings account. I'd like to get it up to an even $30,000 and then take 10 of it to invest, leaving 20K as a safety net. But we have no idea how to invest. I think we're both of the mindset of putting money into something and let it ride, and over time continue to funnel excess funds into more investments and letting it grow.

Paying off all debt as soon as possible ,"Hey all looking for some advice 

My boyfriend and I are slowly paying off our debt. I am in my final semester of college and he has been helping me pay for school out of pocket. I put each payment on my credit card and then pay it off but of course due to other expenses my credit card is currently sitting at 3K. He has almost 9K on his credit card. Now in the spring I will have exactly 3 payments of about $450 that will be added to the card but we have been worried about his card growing so much so we are trying to decide on the best game plan for us. 

I make $2400 a month and he makes $2600 a month, our rent is $950. Starting this next month I will start paying all expenses in our house (besides his car payment, $270) and he will put his entire paycheck towards his card with the exception of his car payment. My school payments will be added to my card and I will pay the minimum balance due. It will take 4 months to pay off his card this way and after that we will switch and he will pay all expenses (besides my car payment, $273) at that point my card will be at at least 5K so it will take me at most 3 months to pay off my card. 

He has no phone payment and I pay $80 a month for my own phone plan (I have a separate bucket that I add money into each month so this can be left alone to pay for itself), all utilities except electric included in our rent, which is usually around $100 a month and internet is $80 a month. We are budgeting to keep $150 from each paycheck in our accounts for gas and groceries. We are prepared to be extremely frugal and do what it takes to pay this off as fast as we can. My younger sister also lives with us and she pays $280 a month for rent and electric as well. ",0,1731947561.0
Please help me find a good breed for me!,"Soo I'm probably gonna move as soon as I can (next 1-2 years or so), and I definitely decided that I would like - if it's possible - a dog so I'm not completely alone. So in the template I'm gonna answer like I already live where I'm going to, as a reference 

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

Yes, but I don't mind extra work if it's a breed that requires some more attention. I have no direct experience owning dogs.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

Preferably from a breeder, cause I feel like raising a puppy might be easier (not saying it always is but I can influence it's behaviour better I think)

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

I would like a dog that's obedient but can still think for himself, if that makes sense. Preferably one that can stay alone for a few hours as an adult, and doesn't mind periods of not a lot of human interaction - like 1-3 hours per day by itself

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I particularly like large dog breeds. I have considered German Shepherds and Greyhounds but I haven't really got to know a lot about their complete care requirements yet. Also, I would prefer short-haired dogs, at least for my first one.

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

I would like to train him to help me with daily tasks, like picking up and putting laundry into the basket, putting dishes in the dishwasher, helping me make the bed, ect. ect. Not necessarily a full-time service dog, but I get tired or even dizzy when moving too much/quick really easily some days so I would like some help with day-to-day activities. Also would like him to go to specific spots when asked & stay there until called up, for example when people are over (I have a friend who's scared of dogs being close to her so it would help if he could stay in his bed then)

**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

No

Care Commitments

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

As long as I can, I'll probably seek out something I can work from home, therefore I'll be there majority of the time. Preferably 50% or less of the day though 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Walks obviously, length of them not more than 2-3 hrs and sometimes dog park trips yea (not sure how often tho) I'd prefer a dog thats perfectly fine with lots of exercise but also perfectly fine with less

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Open to allat except professional, I'll much rather like to do it myself. Cleaning, trimming hair ect won't be a problem

Personal Preferences

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Large Medium or Large (if there's none I would be okay with a medium-small)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Not that much, I'll probably live in an apartment. I prefer little to none to all of these

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Don't care about that too much but it would be nice

Dog Personality and Behavior

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A good mix of both, cause I have those moments too where I want to be left alone and then I want to cuddle non stop. But if I had to choose just one then snuggly I suppose 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Also a good mix to both. Eager to please when I need it to, do it's own thing when not doing tasks.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Cautious, but being able to differentiate between threatening and non threatening behaviour so it knows how to act accordingly. I would like it to just look at maybe boop visitiors to say hello, but not get too excited and jump at em.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Not really no

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

VERY energetic dogs. I don't think I can handle that, I don't think I'm mobile enough to do that lmfao

Lifestyle

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not more than 6-8 hrs daily typically, depends on if I go to school while studying

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

I'll be alone!

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

I have cats currently but they most likely won't be following me. I would however like to get another cat or 2 before the dog moves in, so one that gets along with them would be nice. I also have fish and am looking to adopt other animals like mice or birds in the future.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I'm planning to rent yes, but there's enough apartments that shouldn't hold restrictions.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Germany, and I'm planning to move to Berlin. Not aware of any laws.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

No Idea, it's so difficult every year. Out from the top of my head I'd say summer max 30° C, winter max. -10°C.

Additional Information and Questions

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Try to ignore the financial costs with your recommendations - If not possible, I won't get a dog. I'm just looking to see what breed could work for later in life :)

Car payment but want to save for house,"Hi,

I’m (27M) in a bit of a bind in the fact that I brought a new car last year. The car payments are high and I want to save up for a down payment on a house with my gf. 

This year I was not able to save any liquid cash as my paycheck after rent, food, car payment and retirement savings is neutral. 

On track to max out my 401k, HSA and half of my IRA. Want to finish IRA next year since I have till April of next year.
Income: 85k
401k: 102k (3k still not vested)
Roth IRA: 31.8k
HSA: 15k
Stocks/Crypto: 11k (I can liquidate this as cash for house)
Emergency fund: 10k
Checking account: 3k 

Option 1: Sell car once equity is built for a beater and save the car payment as house downpayment 

Against Logic: Beater will cost more in the long run and the EV will save more in the long run. Driving around 15k a year with EV is saving me around 1.5k in gas. But the car payment and slightly higher insurance is making it hard to see the long run saving. 

Option 2: Don’t max out my 401k and just do the company match and save for house 

Against logic: I didn’t start saving aggressively till I was 25 so I feel like I’m behind so a little hesitant to not max out retirement 

This was definitely more of a want than a need. 2023 Chevy EUV for around 32k MSRP and then I got 4K off in NJ so brining it 28k. I took out a loan for that 28k for 3 years at 3.5% APR and paid around 800 dollars in dealer fees, doc fees and etc but no taxes since NJ is EV tax free when I brought it. 820 car payment but I got 7.5k back from the federal government making it effectively a 21k new car. I just reached 1 year of payment and have 19k left with the car being work right around 19-20k so building equity.",0,1732307978.0

However the last few days he will get in bed, and sit and just sort of act like he does not know what to do. I do not know if it is just his anxiety. I try to pet him, and get him to lie down.

Currently our monthly payment on cards/car total around $1200. 

Another note we’ve debated selling our house to use our equity to pay off our debt. (With the remainder going as a down payment on a house to get a new mortgage around $2100-$2400). This would give us a slightly bigger house which is fun we’re just not sure what the best option is with the market being so slow right now. Price of house would be like $380k and then the loan would be like $300 after putting down payment.

Questioning my choice - breeder questions ,"**UPDATE: We walked away. Thanks for your insights.**

Looking for some help. I've seen a lot of people get direction here on how they can be sure their puppy is in good health and comes from a safe place.

We are supposed to pick up our puppy later this week from a breeder and I want to see if the community has concerns about our situation. I'm not able to add a screenshot of my conversation so I'll summarize my concerns:

1. the breeder says the parents are registered (I didn't ask specifically where) but they are unsure whether there are limitations on registering the puppies. The parents were apparently papered before the breeder got them.
2. I asked if I could get the parents registration information so I can look it up and the breeder then said they're not letting the puppies get registered, they're pets only.
3. I said I'm mostly just interested in pedigree for the sake of the parents health and whether there are spay/neuter requirements. The breeder said there are no requirements and they offer a health guarantee on the puppies... and they didn't say anything else about the parents.

Currently waiting on a copy of the health contract as well as veterinary records.

Can someone help me navigate this conversation and help me know what other questions I should ask while doing my due diligence? Yes there are yellow flags here, but what are the red flags? What information should I be concerned or hesitant with once I get the records?

Need help with my finances. I'm only able to save $200 combined in October and November if I proceed with my purchases. How should I go about this?,"I have about 100k in cash right now. This year I've saved up around 22k so far. I usually try to save up 2k a month but it's not working these last two months. 

Last month I got 

\- New tires at $1.1k out the door 

\- New MacBook that is $1.2 out the door

Last month I lost $730 as I pay rent a day early for this month as well. 

I've paid all my rent and utilities for this month. My next paycheck on Friday would get me to $2300 in savings this month. 

Here are some other expenses that I still need to make.

\- Iphone 15: The battery on my 11 is on its way out. I was thinking to upgrade on Black Friday to take advantage of the gift card discounts for the Apple Store (more on that below). This is around $780 after taxes. 

\- Apple care for the MacBook. My plan is to get the apple care for my MacBook using the gift card to pay part of it. It is either $70 a year auto renewed or $200 for 3 years. Which one is a better deal? 

\- Microsoft office. I'm unable to transfer my old Microsoft word onto my new one, so I have to get a new one on my Mac. That is $130 at least. I've been relying on google docs for now. 

So here, it is about $1110. 

$2300-1110 =$1,190.00 savings this month.

  
I think I'll be spending another $250 for the rest of this month on food, groceries, gas and a haircut. This is a very conservative estimate. That would leave me with $940 of savings this month. If I combine that with last month then I would only end up saving $200 for October and November combined. 

I technically have about $200 I can get reimbursed from my HSA for expenses but right now the insurance wants to reprocess my claim so I don't want to be reimbursed and have to pay back. 

Should I delay my Microsoft office expenses until next month?

Best ways to stop overspending every month and keep saving goals intact?,"HI there, first time poster, f24

I want to start to building my savings/sinking fund but I cannot control my spending. I set a budget every month, have it written out but just can't stick to it. Usually frivolous spending, coffee, food out, had a bit of a rough year so have kind of allowed it but want to start the new year better.

My rent is pretty cheap for my area at the moment so looking to save £600-£700 a month over the next 6 months, so aiming to have about £4.5k saved by May, usually leaving around £400ish month for spending a month. How do I keep to my financial goal intact and prevent myself from overspending in the new year? Thanks in advance!",0,1731880331.0

I chose PPO based on calculations - am I correct? anything I am missing?,"Hello I am switching from a HDHP to PPO and wanted to double check I am not missing anything in my review of the health plan:

The HDHP costs $136/month with a $3,300 deductible, while the PPO is $196/month with a $600 deductible.

I visit a therapist 1-2 times per month, with each session costing about $210, and I also see a licensed nurse practitioner monthly for controlled prescriptions at similar costs. (24 visits per year minimum)

I just met my HDHP deductible this past week, mainly because I started therapy and prescriptions partway through.

I currently have $3,000 saved in my HSA from the HDHP, which my employer and I contributed to (they contribute $2000).

Given that I'm in good health and have moderate healthcare needs, I feel I’m between the low and high spending spectrum. The higher monthly cost of the PPO seems worth it for the much lower deductible since I’d likely save on out-of-pocket expenses with my regular healthcare needs. this plan is for me and my spouse. her visits are less frequent and only go to annual check ups (as of now thankfully)

28 and New to Roth IRAs - Guidance Appreciated,"Hey everyone! I just stumbled upon the Personal Income Spending Flowchart, and I've been deep in the personal finance rabbit hole for the past 48 hours. Finance and investing feel like foreign languages to me, so I’d appreciate any guidance—and some patience with my ignorance, as I'm still learning the ropes.

It was only yesterday that I realized my Roth 401(k) was different from a personal Roth IRA, which explains the title! Here’s a rundown of my situation, and I’m open to feedback on each part:

**Overall Finances:**  
I’m debt-free (no credit card debt or student loans) and recently started investing. I have about $12k in the crypto market (mostly profits from putting my stimulus checks into it in 2020).

**New Roth IRA:**  
I just opened a self-directed Roth IRA through SoFi, though I’ve read most people suggest Vanguard, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab. Did I make a mistake by choosing SoFi? My plan is to max out the $6,500 contribution for 2024.

**Employer 401(k):**  
I contribute to my employer’s 401(k) through Alliance using their balanced investment model. I was contributing $400 per paycheck but recently reworked it to $241.67 (7% of my salary toward the 401(k) and 8% toward my personal Roth IRA to hit the 15% retirement savings benchmark). My employer matches $119.59.

**Additional Accounts:**  
Before I learned about opening a personal Roth IRA, I opened both a brokerage account and an automated brokerage account through SoFi. I’m currently transferring funds out of the automated account because I wasn’t satisfied with its performance. Here’s the breakdown:

* **SoFi HYSA:** $30k
* **SoFi Checking:** $5k
* **Alliance Employer 401(k):** $11k
* **Old Employer 401(k) (need to track this account down):** $1.6k
* **SoFi Brokerage:** $500 in VOO, $50 in QQQ
* **SoFi Automated Brokerage:** $500 (moving this to my regular brokerage soon). Open to suggestions on where to allocate my brokerage funds for maximum growth.

**Investment Strategy:**  
I’m looking for suggestions on a specific asset allocation for US stocks, international stocks, and bonds. The selections are very overwhelming for me I’m familiar with the three-fund portfolio concept, but there are so many options, and all the acronyms feel overwhelming. For context, I’m on SoFi—so any advice on options available through that platform would help. I’m thinking of going aggressive: something like 40% US stocks, 40% international stocks, and 20% bonds. However, I’d be happy to adjust the bond percentage down and go more aggressive given my age, steady income, and job security. 

Any advice on fund choices, platform concerns, or how to approach my investment mix would be much appreciated! Thank you in advance.",0,1732212397.0
[Breeds] Non Shedding Medium Size Psychiatric Service Dog recommendation,"**Introduction**

    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * This will be the first dog I’ll be the sole caretaker of. I have two family dogs at my parents’ home, both female Portuguese Water Dogs. I took care of their hygiene and grooming, enrichment activities, and half of their daily walks (30 minutes to an hour per walk).
    
    I started an associate’s degree to become a vet tech. I took a canine behavior class, so I know the basics well and am eager to learn more. In the future, I’ll pursue a diploma in Canine Behavior and Training.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * No preference, although given my situation, going through an ethical breeder will be the easiest. 
    
    My dog will co-exist with my partner’s small Boston x French Bulldog, a cat, and an 8-year-old child (with us every other week).
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    * A buddy. A pupper that will try to bring me a smile on my saddest days. Being able to share a connection, feeling in sync or sharing a spark with it. Being able to communicate without words. Emotional, inquisitive, human-like eyes. I picture it being emotionally intuitive to its owner’s emotions. Able to vibe whether we are on a hike or watching TV. Handler-focused. Casually unbothered to friendly with other humans. Biddable, versatile, and eager to please. Not pig-headed. Quick to recover after being spooked (not very wary). Humorous, clownish, merry, happy-go-lucky. A dog always happy to tag along.Bouncy/light on its feet
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    *Non-shedding breeds, curly dogs.
    
    The sensation of running my fingers through a dog’s curls is unmatched. It’s a good coping mechanism for me.
    
    I’ve mainly been interested in water dogs, such as Barbet, Lagotto Romagnolo, Portuguese Water Dog, Spanish Water Dog, and Poodles.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Deep pressure therapy, anxiety alert, interrupting meltdowns, things to could help with my executive fonctions, talk buttons. Basic training otherwise
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * No experience at all, but I'd like to do agility and have them as a service dog for my anxiety and autism. This has already been pre-approved by my general pratice doctor. 
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * I want to interact with it as much as I can. At the very least, an hour excluding its walks and sports.
    Training would be done daily, though I’m not sure how long I’d do so each day.
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * The bare minimum would be two daily walks of at least 30 minutes each. I’m expecting more in the range of an hour and a half daily. The first 30 minutes of each walk would be scent-based, and if I want, the last part would be more fitness-focused.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * I’m good with a weekly brushing session, up to every other day. Ear cleaning and nail clipping would be done at home. Professionally groomed four times a year.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Medium sized. At least 20 lbs to 60 lbs at most. Ideally between 25 to 40 ± 5 lbs.
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * No shedding. I’m good with every human/poodle-like coat. I have no issues with my Portuguese Water Dogs. Huskies, Labs, and other shedding dogs can trigger uncomfortable allergies.
    
    Low to medium barking. It’s not a problem if it’s short and brief. If they go on a barking spree for longer than a minute or two frequently, it’s too much. They can be vocal (‘‘talk,’’ grumble, express themselves).
    
    Little to no slobber.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * 7/10. I want to move to a forest and be able to explore the woods with my dogs, play in water, let them loose, and know they won’t ditch me.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Snuggly, but it doesn’t need to be a 10/10 velcro dog.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * Eager to please
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * Can acknowledge people, get up to check what’s going on, then get back to its business. A warning bark is not an issue. I don’t want incessant barking until the person leaves.
    
    Can come and greet people, be happy, and ask for a little petting. If too happy, learning to have something in their mouth to greet people. I don’t want a bunch of barking or jumping on everyone.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * No
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * Any reactivity
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * I work 37.5 hours a week, commute included. Depending on whether it becomes a service dog or not, the amount of time it would spend alone each day could change wildly. At the moment, I leave at 6 AM and come back before 2 PM. I’d walk it before leaving and spend my afternoons and nights with it. It would go to my parents’ or a friend’s for one weekend per month between May and September.
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * They like dogs. They may occasionally help with feeding and taking them out to potty. It will be my dog first and foremost, then a family dog.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * My partner has a French Bulldog x Boston Terrier, who would be around 4 years old by the time I can get my pup. He also has a cat. Both of them are spayed and neutered.
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * Yes, every other week with an 8-year-old child.
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
     
    * Currently renting. Will buy a condo in the city or a house in an agricultural or forest area ASAP.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * Montréal and Québec City, Province of Quebec, Canada. Both cities allow a maximum of 4 cats and/or dogs. Up to 3 dogs per household. You could have 4 cats, 1 dog, 3 cats, 3 dogs, 1 cat, etc.
    
    Dogs over 40 lbs need to wear a harness, halti, or gentle lead in public spaces. Expected to always be leashed.
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * Temperature varies wildly between 35°C to -30°C (95°F to -22°F) throughout the year. Humidity is high year-round. Winter is generally between -5°C to -15°C (23°F to -4°F), and summer can be between 25°C to 35°C (77°F to 95°F).
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    If the dog I adopt isn’t able to make it as a service dog, I won’t be devastated. It’s a huge plus if it could but not life-ending if it can't.",1,1726523241.0
"Car Advice for a Young Family of 3 (1 Income, $75k)","We’re a young family (both 23) with a 6-month-old baby, and I’m debating whether to trade in our 2019 Chevy Trax for a 2024 Toyota Corolla LE. Here’s the situation:

	•	Trax Details:
	•	$327/month, ~3 years left on the loan.
	•	Owe ~$9k, about what it’s worth (no negative equity).
	•	Warranty is expiring soon.
	•	It’s running fine now, but it has overheated and stranded my wife twice recently. I’m worried about future repair bills.
	•	Corolla Details:
	•	MSRP: $23k.
	•	Down Payment: $500–$2k.
	•	Financing: 4.99% for 5 years or 5.5% for 6 years.
	•	Goal: Keep it long-term (200–300k miles if well maintained).

Financial Background:

	•	Income: $75k/year (I’m the sole earner; wife is a SAHM).
	•	Savings: 20% savings rate, 2–3 months in our emergency fund.
	•	Debt: $30k in federal student loans at <5% interest; $118/month payment.
	•	Living Situation: Moving in with her family to save for a house in a few years.
	•	Current Backup Car: A paid-off 2010 Camry with 180k miles (reliable but aging).
I am also contributing 3% to my 401k with a match. It’s not much right now but it’s something 😁.

The Dilemma:

	1.	Keep the Trax: Pay it off over the next 3 years and deal with potential repair costs.
	2.	Trade for Corolla: Get a reliable new car now with manageable payments (~$400–$450/month).

Reliability is our top concern since we have a baby and only one income. If my Camry dies, we need a dependable car for my wife. I like the Corolla for its reputation (I’ve loved my Camry), but I’m unsure if this is the right move with a house purchase on the horizon.

Would you recommend trading for the Corolla or sticking it out with the Trax? Any advice is appreciated!

Edit: Option 3 is selling the Trax for more than our outstanding loan balance and buying a beater with the surplus. If I was single this would be my choice, but we have a baby and I have to provide at all costs yknow? ",0,1732212459.0

How do I fight while avoiding collections?","I keep getting bills for lab work done months ago, but the amount doesn’t match my EOB. The provider is in-network with my insurance.

Every time, they ask me to resend my EOB and claim it’ll take 4-6 weeks to review—but I never hear back.

When I push them on why they can’t review the EOB they receive directly from the insurance, they claim they don’t ever receive EOBs due to 'patient privacy,' which feels like total nonsense.

Aligning 401K for a potential market downturn with limited available plan options?,"Brief background - I've got a bit over $1MM in a 401K, and for the past 20 years I've had it 90% in a S&P500 index fund.  It's done very well for me even through the 2008 crash and various ups and downs as the market does, plus it's one of the lowest management fee options.  My company offers a pretty standard set of 401K fund options - small cap, large cap, foreign, S&P500, government bonds, money market, the company stock, and a whole range of managed/balanced options depending on when you want to retire named by year (2025 fund, 2030 fund, 2035 fund, etc.)  Those date managed funds have much higher management fees, however.  

I'm still at least 4-5 years away from retirement (knock on wood on keeping job - lots of turmoil in IT), and have about 3 months of full-spend savings in the checking account.  There's ALWAYS a drumbeat of pundits saying the greatest black swan in history is UPON US!!, and I've generally ignored them much to my benefit, staying the course in my SP500 index fund.  

I'm growing more worried, though, about a significant correction in the near-mid future (growing US deficits, political paralysis, etc) and not having enough time to grow back out of it.  Given limited 401K choices, what would be the wisest strategy for wealth preservation?  I see lots of posts on this and other forums around investing in precious metals as a wealth store, crypto, etc, but those of course aren't offered by our 401K administrator (Fidelity, as it is for many.)  Bond funds seem to have been a risky hedge recently as they've dropped along with the stock market several times instead of moving opposite.  I'm loath to pay the much higher fees for one of the funds managed to a retirement date, as I'm pretty sure I can manually do what they're doing and save that money.  Money market?  

I love the ease and tax-deferred nature of the 401K (and the sweet 5% match), but the limited investment options can be a problem when you really want to put some of that money into a hedge.  ",0,1732481647.0

Dad 72 no savings and $16k in credit card debt. He has to quit work due to his back and I’m scared for him. What are his options? Finding wfh,"Rent, $1400
Bills ~ $3500
Income $70k. Was laid off a few months ago and will owe money on taxes. Has also not done his taxes in 2 years. 

It’s unfortunately more complicated since he also has a wife with severe Alzheimer’s. She honestly needs to enter a memory care facility but it’s $6,000/month. Her family might help but not clear. He’s currently paying an in-home caregiver $25 an hour when he makes $33 an hour. Not a great situation. 

He has been a career restaurant general manager. He can’t do 9 hour shifts on his feet anymore. He has social security but it’s not enough to keep his apartment.

What are some options? Unclear on exact amount of debt but somewhere I want to guess around 20k. Credit cards are maxed out.

Salary indication at advertising agency,"Hi everyone - wanted to get your thoughts on what a reasonable salary is for certain roles at an advertising agency. 

I’m currently an account manager at a fairly large advertising / marketing agency in Western Europe (EU, not UK).

"Dog DNA Test Kits, are they worth it?",I am a 54 female that has been around dogs all my life so I'm familiar with several breeds.

Even our vet can't pinpoint a single possible breed she may have in her. His response is she's a female large dog mixed breed lol.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* It would be great to do this when they're old enough so we can jog on trails or beach without being leashed.

Our apartment is 85 square meters, with a balcony accessible by doors. We have a shared courtyard downstairs (accessible down one set of stairs) to take the dog for quick toilet trips, green space just across the road.   
  
26) Feel free to ask any questions below.  
  
Is there a way to assess non-registered breeders before buying a puppy? There are a lot of dogs on Trade Me (NZs version of eBay/Craigs List/Marketplace) that would be considered backyard breeders churning out pups for big cash, sometimes multiple litters at a time of different cross breeds. I'm sure some of them do a good job of managing health, genetics, etc but it's hard to know.

Breed Recommendation Request,"Breed Recommendation Request

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, I've had dogs for the majority of my life. I've had mystery mutts, GSD mixes, husky mix, and a hound mix

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I'm getting a little disheartened with shelters after my latest rescues. I prefer to rescue, but I'm definitely open to a breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Not genetically prone to reactivity! I'm a little burned out with reactive dogs. I love my two german shepherd mixes. I love the bond between a herding dog and their person. In terms of energy, medium drive is best. I have done frequent grooming, and would prefer to avoid it. Grooming needs are not deal breakers, though.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I like labradors and golden retrievers in terms of intelligence and personality. I had a lab mix, and he was a great dog. The only drawback is that the bond didn't feel as close as my GSD mixes. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic obedience. Nothing too special. This dog would be a companion dog.

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

529 Plan Distribution for K-12 tuition,"Hello, I do not qualify for the state tax deduction for 529 contributions in my state, so I am happy to look at 529 plans for other states. My goal is to superfund contribution for my child and then withdraw $10k per year once said child starts attending kindergarten at a private institution. I know this $10k is considered a qualified expense for federal tax reasons, but different states vary. Now my question is, do I want to select a states plan that considers this distribution qualified expense or does it not matter if I live in/file taxes in a state that doesn’t consider it qualified? Ie let’s say I like in NY. NY doesn’t consider k-12 a qualified expense for 529 so if I withdraw, the earnings would be subject to NY state tax and 10% penalty. However if I get the Alabama 529, would my earnings on the 10k not be taxed or would it not matter because I live in NY?",0,1731682647.0

HSA: $1k (I get $200 a month from my employer.)

I dont even know if that means they have $700k to their name fully or just hypothetically because its a stock. I grew up in poverty so I taught myself everything. I feel the knowledge I am missing is what isnt easily taught/told to do by, say, Google. 

What else can I do to better at, or add to my portfolio? If you recommend investing, could you please give me a resource I can start reading into? I am so new to stocks, I dont want to go in & waste money.

[Breeds]  Planning to go through breeder or breed-specific rescue for the first time.  Recommendations needed!,"



* Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
   * Not a first dog. Currently have a small pit-heavy terrier mix, 7mo old. Took in after family member adopted as rebound dog and could not handle the puppy stage.  Recently had to say goodbye to a senior Boxer (adopted at 6mo).  Also adopted a teenager from a bad housing situation and had to make the decision to euthanize after she displayed sporadic, unpredicatable dog reactivity, with a violent attack and lack of bite inhibition.  This particular dog showed no signs of reactivity initially, was trained properly in the time we had her, but developed these issues with social maturity. Have done extensive training with all dogs, including some agility work with the Boxer. This recommendation request is to aid with long-term planning, will not get another dog until our current mix reaches social maturity, finishes basic and intermediate obedience training, and ideally receives AKC Good Citizen certification.  We just aren't a single dog household and want to prepare accordingly.
* Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
   * Leaning towards going through a respectable breeder or breed-specific rescue.  Our experience with a teenage, mixed breed dog that showed a propensity for severe reactivity (either due to genetics or lack of socialization), despite best practices in terms of ownership and training, has led us to be more wary of adoption.
* Describe your ideal dog.
   * Playful and high energy when appropriate but able to calm down and relax after exercise and mental stimulation.  Open to new experiences.  Trainable, but doesn't have to be completely pliable or ""easy mode"".  Friendly with family, friends and other pets when introduced properly.  Able to approach new situation with excitement or indifference, not caution or shyness.  Suited to going places socially, both indoors and outdoors.  Not prone to major health issues.
* What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
   * Open to all breeds within the stated parameters.
* What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
   * Sit, stay, down, come, off and leave it are all non-negotiable, along with loose-leash walking.  How to greet calmly and behave in crowded settings.  Everything else is gravy, have enjoyed training beyond these sorts of basic obedience in the past, and will do so with our current young dog.
* Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
   * Will not be a working dog, but would love to get into a sport, non-competitively.  Have done some agility in the past.  Am looking into scentwork for our current young dog, she seems like she would be well-suited to it.   While not a sport per se, we love hiking with our dogs.  Open to low cost and low barrier to entry sports and activities.
* How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
   * Several hours daily.  We spend a lot of time with our dogs.  Much of it relaxing but also plenty of outdoor and play time.
* How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
   * Varies greatly. At minimum a short ""formal"" walk in which the dog is asked to be alert and respond to commands and paying attention, in addition to an intentional and busy outdoor play session.  Other days may include long walks and hikes, swimming and running, or long interactions in public with emphasis on proper ettiquete and expectation that the dog will ""be on"".  Absolutely no dog parks, we are not fans.
* How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
   * Minimal grooming at home.  Willing to pay a professional.  Very wet winters where we live and don't want to deal with dogs that are very difficult when wet.
* 10. What size dog are you looking for?
   * 25-65lbs
* How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
   * Minimal shedding.  Barking is fine.  Slobber is fine as long as it's not extreme.
* How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
   * We reserve off-leash activity for when we are in large natural spaces fairly far removed from other people and pets.  But recall in these situations is fairly important.
* Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
   * Snuggly
* Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
   * Something in the middle. We're used to stubborn dogs and don't mind some ""personality"", within reason.
* How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
   * Barking when someone comes into the yard or knocks on the door. Calming down and greeting in a friendly manner once we confirm through tone and body language that the visitor is friendly.
* Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
   * Within reason but not ideal. Our Boxer did fine with other dogs once she knew them but was generally suspicious of strange dogs and tended to bark but didn't display any serious aggression.  We socialized extensively when she was young, but she was never an amazing dog with other dogs. We were fine managing this behavior for 12 years.  Just knew to cross the street on a walk, distract with voice and treats, etc, and to be careful when introducing to dogs of family and friends.   We had the terrible experience I mentioned earlier when we adopted a teenage dog that developed severe and unpredictable dog aggression.   Our young terrier mix is so far highly submissive to other dogs and we are socializing heavily, but we recognize some of her lineage has a propensity for dog reactivity and are prepared for it.
* Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
   * Absolutely has to be tolerant of children and cats.
* How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
   * Maximum of 6 hours, although this is definitely not a daily occurence.
* What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
   * Spouse and I are on the same page with our preferences. I am the one more inclined to do the training, but the dog must be willing to follow commands from the other members in the family. Child has grown up around dogs and knows how to interact with them, but is still a kid.
* Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
   * As mentioned, a 7mo dog who will be 1.5-2yo by the time we bring another dog into the home.   We have two cats, one loves dogs and plays with them like a puppy.  The other makes it clear he does not like dogs, but will not provoke them and attempts to avoid when possible.
* Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
   * Yes, 7yo child and his friends.
* Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
   * No, we own our home. Large fenced yard.
* What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
   * Rural Pacific Northwest, USA.  Not aware of any breed regulations.
* What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
   * Average Summer day is 80ish fahrenheit and dry, average winter day is 45ish fahrenheit and wet.
* Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
   * This post is for long-term planning purposes, and because we are consider a breeder or breed specific rescue.  We have never purchased a dog from a breeder but have come to appreciate the role responsible breeders play in temperament and health of dogs.   We are fine with less common breeds, as we intend to take plenty of time to research over the next year or so.  If breed-specific rescues are a suggestion, any advice on how to mitigate the risk of genetic abnormalities and potential behavioral issues would be welcome.   Thanks so much!

Dog play,"Hello,

I have two small dogs 3 year old Chihuahua mix (not sure the other mix, maybe Jindo) and a 4 year old Terrier Mix (no idea about the other mix).

I can’t figure out how to get them to play with toys or more enrichment activities.
They are only interested in chasing squirrels and on the rare occasions, chasing each other and “play fighting” in our backyard. 
We occasionally use the sniffle mat because we don’t want to overload them with treats.

They aren’t interested in playing catch/ball (any ball thrown at them, they either try to avoid or just do nothing) and they don’t care for tugging.

They only seem to like going for walks and smelling everything. The terrier mix seems to like to pick fights with any dog that they see… ugh, someone said that maybe it’s to protect the other dog.

Help! We're cat people doing an emergency dog-sit for family and this dog is apparently not house trained????,"Seriously, looking for help or suggestions.

My BF and I are very much cat people. We have three cats. Neither of us *mind* dogs, dogs are fine, but dogs are not pets that we would seek out for ourselves or our home. However, due to an emergency situation (unexpected family death, their owner has to travel for funeral, etc) we are now dog-sitting for at least a week.  The dog has been in the house for an entire thirty minutes so far and has already peed twice (once on linoleum and once on carpet) and chased the cats into hiding. Bf took it for a walk, I'm calming the cats down and querying Reddit.

Dog in question belongs to someone in BF's family. She's not a puppy but is still a younger, VERY high-energy pittbull mix. Super sweet, very loving, but so. Much. Energy. Dog's owner supposedly was taking them to obedience school, but possibly has given up? Or just never reinforced what they were teaching? Idk but the dog is clearly not housebroken despite having been adopted A YEAR AGO. Bf's dad dropped her off with a dog bed, some wee pads, and an upfront offer to COME BY WHEN THEY'RE BACK IN TOWN TO DEEP CLEAN THE CARPETS. SO YOU KNOW THE DOG ISN'T HOUSE TRAINED, WHICH WAS THE ONLY THING WE ASKED WHEN YOU ASKED US TO DOGSIT.

Sorry, seems like this has turned into a rant, but are there any tips to help us survive this week with our sanity, floors, and the continued goodwill of our cats?

What toys are best to gift a puppy?,"Hi everyone, my teacher has a 14 week old Dachshund puppy that she brought to school last week for socialization, and I spent some time puppy-sitting her that day. Today the puppy unexpectedly had to undergo surgery for something (not life-threatening but scary nonetheless) and her owner seemed very distressed about it so I was thinking of buying a get-well-soon gift for the puppy. She’s teething so I was thinking maybe a chew toy? She was biting in hands playfully/biting in anything she could get basically. They do have a toy she can bite but it’s not a special teething toy. She was very energetic and enjoyed jumping on bean bag chairs/playing tug of war/running after her ball. I wanna gift something that is durable and will withstand her rough playing, and could perhaps also help in adolescence/adulthood. What kind of toys did your puppy like/what are the most durable and suitable toys for a puppy? Is a teething toy a good gift? ",1,1732127812.0
"Aggression, growling, + alcohol?","Hi! My partner and I have an 80-something lbs Alaskan Malamute / German Shepherd Mixed Breed Dog who’ll be turning 3 in November.

We adopted him from a rescue when he was 2 months old. We were told his litter was abandoned in the woods.

He’s super smart, picks up on things quickly, and has a huge goofy personality which we love, but  he’s also pretty skittish. Any “aggression” seems to be fear based or when he’s overstimulated and we’re trying to work on building his confidence. This looks like barking/growling when I (28F) take him for walks and a man walks past us or if he’s being surrounded by strangers.

Earlier this year, our dog started growling at my partner (28M) when he came home after drinking alcohol. It initially felt really random and we were confused because our dog would go back to being playful/cuddly in the morning. We eventually picked up on the pattern that he only does this when my partner has had something to drink. — My partner has never been physical/abusive nor does he drink to the point of acting super erratic. I can only assume it’s the way my partner smells when he drinks? — I’m not sure what else would be the cause since our dog only lives with the both of us and we adopted him at such a young age I can’t imagine he’s had a bad experience with someone + alcohol prior.

Lately it seems like even after having just one beer, our dog is growling at my partner — but not right away? My partner would have a beer and 1-2hrs later they’ll be playing and all of a sudden he’ll just give a low/deep growl. He won’t bare his teeth, but when my partner tries talking to him he’ll hide his face and try to avoid facing him + continue groaning/growling. Or he’ll come and try to hide his face on my lap/behind me.

We’re not sure how to combat this besides having my partner ignore him whenever he’s had something to drink. I’m not sure if this is enabling this behavior either though or if this is something we should seek a behaviorist for. Any thoughts or suggestions?

Thank you so much in advance!

Note: I’m not much of a drinker, but there was one night earlier this year where he did growl at me too. (Same night where we realized it’s the alcohol) — Our dog is also intact too, not sure if this will matter but thought I’d mention it anyway.

Student in UK struggling with money,"I'm a student in the uk, and I've got the highest student maintenance loan available, but because of timings of payments I will not be able to manage in the near future. This year I'm having to live in my overdraft for about a month and a half before I can get my next student loan payment because they took an uneven amount of money from me this term. I think I can manage but it is definitely a struggle and I'm looking forward to being out of it

I recently put down a deposit on a shared flat next year that will end up saving me over £500 compared to this year in rent over all, but they are asking for jalf rent up front in july. I was going to struggle to pay the normal rent for summer, but there is absolutely no way I can get over £2500 spare money by then. Its going to be better over all, but I don't know how to manage over summer. I'm thinking of applying for a hardship loan with my uni as they are 0% interest but do not know whether it would be better to get in early or wait till closer to the time.

Help us decide what to do with end of year bonus,"I am fortunate enough to have a pretty decent job with a generous (for us at least) bonus structure. The beginning of the year it's going to be roughly 16-18k take home. Hard to say exactly because they don't give us that info until end of January but it's going to be larger than last year which was about 15k take home. 

Now for the question. My wife's car has $13k left to pay at 2.9% interest. We could pay this off completely and still have a little extra to either put in savings or go towards something else. The only other major debts besides house would be her student loan which is about $22k and interest across the various loans is sort of all over the place. Not entirely sure how it works with paying some of those off if we are able to pick and choose, etc. Would our monthly payment go down from $250 if we paid off some portions? And my car is at $16k 0% interest.

I know and hear horror stories about student loan debt but I didn't go to school and never had any to pay off myself. The kicker for this is my wife lost her job in March and we've been doing pretty well budgeting on one income. She's looking to go back to work when our youngest starts school in August. Paying off the car would put $500 a month back in our pocket which in my mind, would help us pay for the loan each month and have extra cash for whatever we need. It was tight before when her loan was frozen. Yearly salary increase should hopefully offset the cost and cover that monthly payment. But we'd still like to make the best decision here for our immediate future of getting back out of debt, even while only being on one income. 

TLDR:

Wife car $500/month @2.9%
Student loans $22k @ varying percentages, none higher than 5.
My car $425/month @0%

Which do you recommend putting my estimated 16-18k bonus towards? Some details from above are important for this decision so please try to read! Thanks in advance",0,1732234099.0

Bedtime ,"We and our 4 dogs just moved to a new house, its been over a week, on Wednesday itll be about 2 weeks, we used to live in a caravan so the dogs are not used to a house with rooms etc. Other than when they were in the dog hotel for a good amount of time (we went on holiday then was homeless so we had to find a home before taking them back)
Right now they are adjusting,  to being with us again, in a new house, wirh lots of newness! 

Sleeping wise, we all sleep in the room, our youngest pup shes in a pen and the 3 dogs on a blanket on the floor, in our caravan when it was just the 3 dogs not the pup, they used to sleep on the bed, we didnt want them to at first but we did find comfort in it, but then i saw the issues of it, and now since being back they have wanted to join us on the bed but we have a gate seperating the bed and them...
Many times 2 of them are really good, my smallest dog out of the 3 is a good boy, he doesnt complain at all, especially when we are just going to bed; but after a few hours and even after they go out for a pee if they need in the AM, they sometimes cry to go out of the room to most likely sleep on the couch downstairs, but we dont exactly trust them alone downstairs yet, we can try it out but i jist get concerned incase they try rip up stuff because we arent there even more so if the door to our bedroom is closed. Because sometimes my dog likes to patrol,..
Sometimes they cry in the morning even if they were out not long before and my sleep gets disturbed... im very pregnant so my sleep is already crazy disturbed 🤣🤣

There had been a few nights where we've fallen asleep on the couch, nd the dogs sleep through the night with no complaints, probably because theres nothing stopping them from jumping up on the couch!  Id been able.to sleep thru the night till a good time, I do think the core isssue is that my dogs want to be on the bed and if they arent then theyre more restless. Because i bet if theyre laying on the bed theyll sleep all night lol
Im wondering if comfier dog beds would help them. 

Is this something that will change with time? Or something that needs to be trained out of them? 
Perhaps through not allowing them on the bed, they will chill out. 
What if we also stop them being allowed to come on the couch, would that help them from feeling like they need to be on the bed/couch?

I have $40k in savings from working all through uni and $26k in student loans. Although they're in special forbearance until Feb, I'm planning to throw a minimum of $200 per paycheck at them. If nothing major happens, might start tossing extra in from savings once payments resume but idk if it's a good plan.

My groceries are $60-70/week and are largely produce, tofu, and snacks. The go-to is hmart or a local chinese grocer (and that's non-negotiable). District I've recently moved to has a lot of quality takeout. On average, it costs $15 if you're buying a vegetarian dish, plus $6-7 if you want boba.

My plan is still set up with that advisor as the advisor on record. I'm still paying them off every $ I put in but they do not monitor the investments or provide and support related to the plan?

My question...is there a way to remove them without adding a new advisor? Ideally I'd switch to a direct plan but I can't  find an option to do that or remove without adding someone new. I've called the support line but they always refer me back to my advisor.",0,1732304481.0

Converting 401K Pre Tax to Roth IRA Using the 401K Balance?,"I'm looking for some advice or insight regarding converting my old 401K balance to my Roth IRA - and whether I can use the current investment balance to pay for the incurred tax the conversion will bring?

Context: I (25 years old) was laid off from my job in the middle of the year - and I've been heavily investing my paycheck since I started working at 21. My 401K balance is around 100k currently (50k in a Pre Tax 401K, 50k in a Roth 401K). Since the 401K has more expense fees and less fund options - I figured I would transfer all of it into my Roth IRA account.

My question - is it possible to convert the 50k in the pre tax 401K over to my Roth IRA? I know that this is a taxable event - but is it possible to use the current investment balance to pay for the tax?

Example: I convert all of the 50k from pre tax -> my Roth. Let's say it is taxed around 22% (the tax bracket I would be in if I converted it all at once) - around 11K. Is it possible to have Fidelity take that 11k from the 50k balance? So then it would become 39k in my Roth IRA?

Comparisons:

Option 1: I keep the 50k in a IRA and don't convert it to a Roth. It grows at 6% annually for 35 years to become $384,304. I get taxed whenever I withdraw that money depending on how much I withdraw/make that year.

Option 2: I convert it all to my Roth immediately - after tax it becomes 39k. It grows at 6% for 35 years to become $299,757. This way I would lose out on around 84k in potential earnings, but I would also have more flexibility when withdrawing (Ie: giving inheritance to family, paying for vacations or large purchases after retirement, etc) since it's already been taxed.

Because I'm young and have plenty of my career to come - and won't be touching the money for probably \~40 years or more - I'm considering taking the potential earnings hit for the flexibility the Roth withdrawals would bring. I know I can always contribute to a 401K traditional in the coming years of me working - so do you think it would be wise to consider converting my balance to a Roth? Would love your advice.",0,1732340954.0
I Made a Series of Financial Mistakes and Lost Everything—Looking for Advice to Start Over,"

Hi, everyone.
I never thought I'd be in a position where I’d be asking strangers for advice, but here I am. Over the past two years, my life has completely unraveled, and I’m struggling to figure out how to pick up the pieces.

It all started during the pandemic. I was doing okay financially, working a steady job and saving little by little. But when the stock market dipped, I thought I saw an opportunity to grow my savings quickly. I went all in—everything I had—on a few individual stocks, ignoring the warnings about diversification. At first, things looked promising, but as the market shifted, I realized too late that I didn’t know what I was doing. I lost nearly my entire savings, around $25,000, which was everything I had worked for.

To make matters worse, my marriage began falling apart during this time. The financial stress, combined with other personal issues, became too much. My wife left and took our 5-year-old daughter with her. I don’t blame her—I wasn’t the person she married anymore.

Now, I’m living paycheck to paycheck, trying to make ends meet. I rent a tiny studio apartment, and my credit card debt is piling up because I can’t keep up with basic expenses. I’m drowning and feel like I’ve let everyone, including myself, down.

I know I made mistakes, and I’m not looking for pity. What I really need is advice. How do I start over when I’ve hit rock bottom?

Here’s where I stand:

    Income: $2,800/month after taxes
    Rent: $1,200/month
    Credit Card Debt: $9,000 at 22% APR
    No savings, no investments, no retirement accounts
    Skills: Basic office work, but no degree

I’m open to any suggestions—whether it’s budgeting, side gigs, negotiating debt, or just emotional advice on how to stay hopeful. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you climb out of it?

Thank you for reading. I appreciate any guidance you can offer.",0,1731956498.0
How to help my dog and sister through tragic death,"My sisters dog (2 years old) and my dog (5 years old) were playing in the yard yesterday and i suddenly realised they had gotten out and ran out. Me running out caused my sisters dog to think we were playing and she ran out on the road and got hit by a car. She screamed once and was then quiet as she got into shock. We rushed her to the vet, they stabilised her but after they took x-rays they realised they couldn't save her and she was put down. 

My sister is completely beside herself and I am grieving with her. Everything now is just so horrible and I can believe we will never see her again. I feel so unbearably guilty, if I had just done anything different both dogs would be alive. This dog was everything to my sister and I am trying to be there for her. 

When my sister got her as a puppy, my own dog took her in a her own, cared for her and taught her how to be a dog. They loved eachother, we walked them together and they played together almost every day (we live very close to each other and often took turns looking after both of them). 

My dog saw everything. She is clearly very affected. When I took her out later that day she pulled to go out to the spot and stood and sniffed around the road for many minutes. This morning we were crying and watching a video of my sisters dog ""talking"" and my dog suddenly came running, head and tail high looking around. I feel so bad for her. She lost her best friend and little sister. She has never cared about cars but on her evening walk today she launched aggressively for three cars passing by too close.

We are all grieving and trying to get by this fucking horrible and terrible time. We are going tomorrow to the vet to see her one final time (and to take a paw print) as everything just happened so fast. 

My question is if I should bring my dog with me? To sniff her friend one last time and maybe give her some closure. Will she even smell like herself? Will it help my dog in any way?

Any additional help or advice to help either my dog or sister will be much appreciated !",1,1728182433.0

Breed recommendations small/medium dog Europe,"I’m looking for a suitable family dog for in the future. My husband prefers a smaller dog, but I would prefer a medium sized dog. Although ultimately temperament is the most important so we’re both willing to meet each other in the middle on this! Would prefer going through a breeder as this will be our first dog. We’re considering a Barbet, but my husband would prefer a smaller dog. 

Are there any alternatives that are a bit smaller but have a similar temperament? I looked at the poodle, but possible nervosity is what’s holding me back. 

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes it will be our first dog. We have had a cat for over 6 years. I was around dogs when I was young.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

At the moment going through a reputable breeder. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

My ideal dog would be calm inside. Not nervous. Low shedding and would listen relatively well with training and will stay close outside. Active outside, but we won’t have a high fence in our yard (also not possible). Would be nice to be able to walk off leash in the country side, which is allowed and common where I live. As a family we’re often outside. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Interested in several breeds. My husband would like a smaller breed and I would like a medium.  

Highly considering a Barbet. It’s a bit big for my husband but ultimately the temperament is much more important. Are obviously open to other breeds. 

Other options I’m considering: Medium poodle, Volpino Italiano or German Spitz, Retro pug (regular pugs or French bulldogs are forbidden where I’m from, which is not Italy). Someone in our town has a Volpino Italiano who’s calm and always walks off leash next to her. 

My husband likes: Havanese or Coton de Tulear, as they’re eager to please and can be trained by a first dog owner. I’m less attracted by these breeds though. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Off leash walking and general training. We’re both committed on training the dog and ourselves. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Definitely obedience and might do agility. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I’m mostly home, might work part time in the future. So I will be playing and interacting most of the time with the dog. Husband works fulltime and kids go to school. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Mainly walking, playing and training. Could also do occasional swimming in the sea. There are no dog parks where I live.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I can pay for a professional but will brush regularly. I’m planning on learning how to trim the dog myself but will start with a groomer. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

I would like a medium dog (max 50 cm, 20 inch). My husband would like a smaller dog but is open to a medium dog if they have the right temperament, same for me the other way around.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Preferably low shedding, not allergic though. Low/occasional barking and no slobber. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Very important with training. At the moment we live in an apartment but will likely move outside the center and have a yard. It’s very hilly so big fences are uncommon. Small fences are possible, but not sturdy. We visit family regularly and stay with them, their places don’t usually have fences though. So we need a dog who doesn’t run away when given the opportunity.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A snuggly dog.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

More eager to please 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Be friendly with visitors

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

No excessive barking and not aggressive. Although I know the first one might be reduced by training. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not often, a few hours here and there. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Husband and kids want a small and a dog who’s not active all the time.  Kids are small though so they mainly look at how dogs look lol. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

We have an older cat now. I’m not sure if he will still be here when we get a dog though. The dog will probably meet other cats though. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, a 4 and 6 year old. They’re used to a cat and are cautious. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Yes rent right now, but might buy soon. No breed/weight restrictions. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Italy. No banned dogs.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

30 Celsius in summer (86F), 5-10 Celsius in winter (50F) 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We regularly visit family abroad for 3-4 weeks and stay with them. We go there by car so the dog needs to be rather flexible and able to join us.   

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

Any recommendations for other breeds that I haven’t considered? I’m in Europe, and I’m willing to travel to other countries for the right dog!",1,1727007844.0

Dog breed suggestions!,"

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I've owned dogs my whole life and have trained all of mine myself. 

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Not necessarily, though when I adopt this dog I would like for it to be a young puppy. 

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* A medium to large size dog 50-70 lbs, weary of people but not outright aggressive, good with other animals, minimal slobber, short to medium length coat.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* A few breeds I've looked at are the Beauceron, Doberman, Belgian Tervuren, and the Dalmation. Any other breeds that would be good for me to look at, that aren't too rare? I like these dogs for their appearance, with the first 3 having darker coat colors and a more intimidating physique to hopefully make a potential intruder think twice before entering my home. 

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 

* I usually just train my dogs random tricks or useful things such as pushing open doors for me or retrieving items.

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* The dog will not partake in sports, just a pet to guard my home. 

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Training time will be as needed for the individual dog, I usually play about 1 or 2 hours with my current dog per day, when not on walks we usually hang out and watch tv. 

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* I usually take 30 minute runs twice daily before and after work with my dog, on weekends I am a bit more active and when weather is nice I take my dog for walks in the forest which can be 2-3 hours over difficult terrain. I do not use dog parks because I do not allow my dog to interact with dogs I do not know. 

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* For my current dog, I brush, bathe and trim her nails as needed by myself.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* 50-70 lbs

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Preferably low shedding but I can handle more, barking is okay, minimal slobber.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I prefer having a dog that would stick next to me if I allow it off leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* A healthy mix of both

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* I want a dog that will alert me if someone is near my home and will be weary of new people until I confirm that the new person is okay.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, I currently have another dog.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 8-10 hours per day. I work full time.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* N/A

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* I currently have one other dog and a pair of geckos and in the future will be expanding my reptile collection, they of course will not interact with the dog though and will have a separate room that my dogs will not be allowed in. I am considering adopting a cat but the cat would come before the dog so the new dog would grow up around the cat and be accustomed to it. (I previously owned a cat so my current dog is good with them) 

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA, I don't believe there are any breed bans in my area

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* I've not lived in this area very long and according to my friends I haven't experienced a real winter yet so i'm not sure exactly what to expect. The summer is typically 90-100, last winter it got down to -5 (Fahrenheit). The dog won't be kept outside for extended periods of time though, especially when weather is intense.

Other Information: I am avoiding ""bully"" breeds and German Shepherds. I personally do not like bully breeds at all and have had too many bad experiences with friend's GSDs.  
  
A bit more about me and my current dog to give an idea of the type of owner I am: My current dog is a Border Collie, I want something with good energy levels to keep up with her, but maybe not quite as insane because my girl does not have an off switch lol. She is the best trained dog I've ever had and I'm very proud she's mine as all her training has been done exclusively by me, I've had her since she was 8 weeks old. She never gets into anything, I can leave food or other desirable items out in front of her all day and she will not touch them without an okay, has a great recall, and knows various weird tricks. I trained her to know both verbal commands and hand gestures so that if she goes deaf with age she will still understand what I am asking of her. She's also crate trained, and minds very well when corrected. I don't follow any specific training methods, I just get a sense of what the dog responds to best and work from there. I'm big on using body language to convey a message when correcting behaviors. I fix my dog an enrichment toy before work every day so she has something to be entertained by for a little bit. While my BC is a great dog, she looks like she came out of a cartoon (Lanky legs, one ear is floppy, the other isnt, always bright eyed) and thinks everybody is her best friend so she is not very intimidating.

Options Question - does this sound like good advice?,"I read this on another thread and am not well-versed in options.

**Does this sound  like a smart thing to do?**

Buy SPY puts (0.5% of your portfolio) target price of $413 (30% below) with expiration of 2 months. After a month, sell and repeat. If the market stays normal, those options won't drag your portfolio but if there is a crash, that 0.5% will go up so much, saving your portfolio. The Roth-IRA account is so in case your options go up in value 20X-40X, you won't have to pay capital gains. With that money, you purchase more shares of SP500 fund.

That way, if the SP500 continues to climb, you'll be doing great. The options is to be able to sleep at night knowing you're protected in case of a crash. And most importantly, so you won't spend time looking at stocks all the time. Focus in moving up (career wise) and enjoying life.

How soon is it okay to include another household when rescuing a puppy?,"Hello everyone,

Advice on using trust fund money,"Not sure if I’ll get answers to all my questions here, but hoping I can gain a little insight.

I had an injury at birth due to medical negligence. My parents sued the doctor and settled out of court. So far I’ve received 4 annual payments of $40,000 each that started when I was 18. This money was primarily used to pay for my college tuition, and I feel *extremely* lucky to not have student loans like the majority of people I know do. Judging by how much my tuition was, I’d conservatively estimate that there’s about $50,000 left in my account. The next payments are set to begin when I turn 25. I’ll be getting 4 payments of approximately $250,000 every 5 years until I turn 40. I’m just curious as to how I should use the money as it comes along. I’m already investing in a Roth, though that has been exclusively with my own money from working. I’m definitely planning to use the first $250k payment to put a down payment on a house, but beyond that I’m honestly sort of lost. As of now, I’m thinking some more investment accounts, real estate (either as a rental or personal vacation home use, or both) and obviously regular savings.

The money was set up by the attorney to be held in and paid out from a Supplemental/Special Needs Trust managed by my parents. I’ve heard the main advantage of this type of trust is that it enables the beneficiary to still continue to collect government benefits, provided you spend the money on a very strict list of necessities. I collect no benefits, so I *assume* that I can really spend the money on anything I want/need since I’m not being audited/monitored for benefit eligibility. Obviously I still plan to use it responsibility, but am I correct in this assumption?

advice for credit card debt payoff? ,"I 28F have a total of about 96k in debt, 67k of that being student loans and the rest being consumer debt (car loan and credit cards). 

I have the following credit cards:
AMEX: $4100. 0% interest until April 1 ($100 minimum payment)
Citi: $3550. 0% interest until July 1 ($50 minimum payment)
Discover: $18,000. 22.49% interest ($350 minimum payment)

Does it make more sense to A) throw extra money towards the 0% cards during this promotional period or B) throw the money towards the Discover card given the large balance and then try to pay off the 0% cards before the promotional period is over?

After paying the minimums, I have about $700 that I can allocate to whichever that card should take priority.

TIA!

Update: I was able to get the Discover card interest down to 9.99% for 6 months!",0,1731694179.0
Are capital gains ever taxed at 40%? ,"I am not well-versed in capital gains things so please forgive my ignorance.  Today my father (70 years old and retired) was stressing out about his HELOC payments. He says he pays $2500 a month only in interest and nothing towards the principal.  His HELOC is $180,000.  His house is worth about 2 million and he has around 1.2 million invested (mutual funds and REITs).  I asked him why not just cash out some investments to pay down the HELOC?  He said he can’t because if he were to sell any investments right now he’d be taxed at 40%.  I didn’t argue but that high of number didn’t sound right.  He lives in Utah which doesn’t seem to have outrageous tax rates in general.  Is 40% possible?  Thanks in advance for any help and advice.  ",0,1732001826.0
Anyone able to stop the howling?,"I recently learned via a Ring camera that my 4 year old Maltese will bark/howl when we go out. It doesn't seem to happen much when we go to work, but seems to occur multiple times if we leave for a few hours into the evening (for example, on the weekend). My husband comes home every weekday for lunch, and I don't come home later than 3:30 PM usually (leaving around 8 am). If we are going to be gone for more than a few hours on the weekend, and my mom can't watch her, my neighbor checks in. I see a lot of similar posts, but would love ""success stories"" with what worked. She is super excited when we leave because she knows she's getting treats  in a ruffle mat and a puzzle thing; she doesn't display any signs of anxiety.

W2 to 1099 - Help with calculations ,"Have the opportunity to leave corporate and join a startup. Owner wants me to come up with a comp plan to present to him. Don't want to rob him, but would like to maintain my current lifestyle plus some due to the risk I'm assuming.

Weekly commission: $456
Car allowance per month: $400
Phone allowance per month: $100
PTO: 25 days
Holidays: 6 federal holidays given

I'm in a sales based role and will be joining a start up where I need to produce as well, I would like a base salary of some sort as well as a commission or bonus structure to incentivize myself. The start up's goal is to grow fast and sell the company in 5 years or so, so I also wonder if I should be asking for some sort of ownership percentage although I don't want to sound greedy.

Advice! (Not medical),"My dog is a 7.5 y/o Great Pyrenees/Lab Mix, so he is big and fluffy. I am graduating college this semester and I want to bring him to tailgates. He is an honorary brother at one and he loves spending time with them. The problem is people like to touch him randomly and he gets tired. My plan has been to buy a utility cart with an overhang and buying fans that attach to the side. My issue, how do I get him used to it, and feel relaxed enough to lay in it when making longer distances? I am putting his blanket and some toys in it to make it more fun and have his scent in it for him. Is it just going to take time and rounds of training? He loves car rides and sits well and peaceful for long drives. Sorry for rambling, any training advice helps. 

Edit: my dog LOVES being in large areas and meeting people. He has been to tailgates, festivals, and large community events with no issues. The house we tailgate at is smaller in population and has a large yard for him as well. We have been going here for five years. He just gets tired quickly and I don’t like the idea of people randomly touching him. I’m hoping the cart will help keep him active as he ages. ",1,1726593887.0
Looking for Breed recommendations for my own pup!,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I've lived with and cared for family dogs (Labrador retrievers) all my life, and now in my early adulthood I'm looking to add my own pup to my life. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Due to health and breed concerns, I'm a little more interested in seeking a dog through a reputable breeder, but if the right shelter dog fits the bill I'd love to adopt.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* A mid-energy dog of medium or large size. I'm only 5ft tall and work full time, so I would prefer to avoid high-energy, very large breeds. I'd look for a dog I can take on outings to the parks or friends spaces, or be comfortable having an in-day with!

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I've become increasingly interested in getting a corgi dog due to their size and popularity (and they're adorable!). The Shiba Inu has peaked my interest as well for similar reasons. I've always had labradors my whole life, so I am a big fan of retrievers as well.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Leash training and socialization are a must, as I'm looking for a dog I can take places and meet other people/animals and not have to fear them lashing out or attempting to hide. Basic commands are planned as well, and maybe crate training.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No interest in competition or work.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Anytime outside of regular work hours I plan to be ready to commit to my dog if needed. Due to full-time work hours, I am also considering daytime dog care or training options.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-3 hours daily on average, both in home and external locations like the park. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am willing to groom at home as well as bring to a professional, but I'm not too thrilled of the idea of a breed that is high-maintenance in terms of grooming beyond the regular brushing, cleaning, and trimming.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large, but small could be considered. On the other end, as much as I adore larger dogs, I am pretty short and fear lacking the ability to move a bigger dog in an emergency.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I'm not too picky in terms of shedding or barking! Slobber is tolerable to a certain amount.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Unnecessary, I'd rather have them leashed unless the area is fenced.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly Velcro dogs are my favorite.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More toward the eager-to-please side of things, but I could use some time to myself where my dog could keep busy on its own.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Barking is probably preferred in this scenario, but once strangers and visitors are introduced I'd look for friendliness from my dog.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Preferably no.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I keep lizards as pets as well, and while they primarily remain in their enclosures, I'd prefer my dog to not have a prey drive so strong they try to get at my lizards.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Three days a week, during work hours (8 hours) at the maximum. I plan to look into daytime dog care like training camp or dog walkers for those days.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live with my sister, who is also fully prepared to help in caring for the dog, with similar preferences to my own.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* As mentioned above, I keep pet lizards as well, but I hope them to not be much of a problem to having a dog. There's the chance of an additional dog or a cat later on.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not regularly, but I'd like them to be friendly with children.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* N/A

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* N/A

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Central Florida summers average 90 degrees F, and winters get no colder than 50 degrees F on average.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* If anyone has any reputable breeder recommendations I'd gladly take those too!

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

Thank you!",1,1729177956.0
Bringing a stray puppy from the Philippines.,"Hi there,
 
I’m currently in the Philippines for a month long holiday, and I’m now on the last 2 weeks. 

Recently, at the beach, where I was in a hut for the day, a stray puppy came along with some other stray dogs, looking for food. I noticed how this puppy seemed lost, dishevelled and didn’t seem to have his mother.

As we were about to leave, I told my family that I’m going to take the puppy with us. I’m glad I did, because I don’t think it would have survived much longer.

So, I fed and watered him, kept an eye on him, played with him etc. He’s now flourishing, he’s healthy, and is bonding with me. He’s very energetic, curious and loves to nibble on things (toes included!).

I’m going to be devastated to leave him behind, and would like to seek advice on bringing him home back to the UK. It seems so long winded, and I was wondering if there was any easier way to facilitate all this? Are there any charities that can help? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who gave their advice and input. I will contact the Pet Trans Pro that someone gave on here. If it’s not realistic, I will still have someone who will look after him here on the island :(  My partner back in the UK said he may try and help me.

I understand, that il have to buy him a “ticket” as he wouldn’t be coming with me as I leave on the 8th October. It all costs money, and I’m not rich right now, but I will try my best!",1,1727352907.0

Walking two dogs with different paces.,"Hi fellow dog lovers, have a quick question. The gist of it is, I'll be helping a relative dogsit next week. Their dog is an older dog who has mobilty issues and can't walk too fast or far. My own dog walks much faster and likes going on longer walks.

I have dogsit before so both dogs are familiar and friendly with each other. I would also usually have someone else with me and we'll take one each to handle the different paces, but I'll be alone this time. So the question is, what's the best way to handle both dogs without compromising them?

Should I just wake up earlier and bring them both on separate walks? Do I just wait for the older dog and take breaks in between? My relative has a stroller for the dog as well.

Open a Roth before or after paying off debt and having 6 months saved?,"I earn about 65K as a state employee and am only contributing 5.5% to retirement. Employer match is 6.25%.

My only debt is a car loan (36 months at 5.99%) and I’m already 4 months ahead. I expect to have it paid next December. I currently have 4 months of expenses in my HYSA.

A part of me is screaming that TIME is ticking and I can open something now and make smaller contributions instead of waiting. But then the part of me that wants to be rid of debt is saying I could use that money to pay it off even sooner.

Fixing old Sequoia or buying late model Sequoia,"I have a 2008 Toyota Sequoia with 270K miles, and recently it has developed a minor head gasket leak.   The cost to fix the leak is most likely around $5,500.     This Sequoia has new Radiator core, and has been well maintained and some engine work done as a tune up and oil gaskets in the upper part of the cylinders replaced.    Transmission is original.   

Replacement vehicle under consideration is 2021 Toyota Sequoia TRD Pro which is about $55K with about 28K miles.   

My thought process is getting a vehicle with less than 50K miles so it has time before maintenance becomes an issue.    Getting a 2018 with 100K miles for $31K seems like I would be continuing a cycle of auto maintenance going forward.

At the moment I feel spending $5,500K for new head gaskets is the more sensible thing to do and continue to drive the 2008 Toyota.

Intially my three cats hated him (of course) but with some gentle introductions my two older cats mostly ignore him. The youngest cat likes to play but he gets too rough with her and I have to constantly micro manage them. He always ends up taking it to far. 

He has lots lf toys and always has a chewy bone which he enjoys. I take him for a mid day 20 min walk and he goes out in our garden (which is big) in the mornings and afternoons and any time he wants on the weekend. 

Initially I enjoyed playtime with him, and still do however, my want to play with him is just getting weaker and weaker the more I grow to dislike him. I constantly feel guilty when people fawn over him, thinking he would probably be much better loved elsewhere.

So here are the issues causing our relationship to be so bad:

He is always getting into fights with my older cats as he will try and play with them

He always takes playing with my younger cat too far and it causes me stress

He has started to chew my skirting boards and damage my house even though he has ample toys and space.

He is very licky and I can’t get him to ever calm down. I just want to sit with him or lie down but he will immediately be all over me no matter what.

He always seems hyperactive and follows me everywhere 

I never imagined chihuahuas being calm dogs and maybe he is still young but it seems no matter what I do he is never calm and will try and destroy anything behind my back.

When I look at him I just feel annoyed and frustrated. I kept thinking this feeling would go over time as we grew closer but I just don’t feel any connection to him at all. He just feels like a day to day chore and I feel guilty that I don’t love him. What do I do?",1,1730243844.0
Advice on what to do with a lump sum of cash?,"Wife and I are about to come across a sizable lump sum of cash (200K+) and would love to invest it for our retirement. However, we currently are not maxing out all of our retirement options just because we couldn’t really afford to. Here’s the breakdown:

- My 401k - not maxed but contributing 14%

- Her 401k - maxed

- My HSA - maxed

- Both Roth IRAs - maxed out for 2024, not sure if we can max out for 2025

- Emergency fund - 6 months worth of expenses

- No other debt except mortgage and small credit card expenses that we pay off every month

Question is - should we just dump the entire lump sum into a taxable brokerage or should we set a little bit on the side so we can max out my 401K and both of our Roth IRA’s for the next year? If so, for how long? Any other options that I’m not considering?

My dog got a uti and it’s my fault,"I moved to another state where I do have friends but no family. This week I got extremely sick with the flu. My dog did not get the care she needed because I felt like I was dying and could barely get out of bed. I had no one who could come help me, plus, to get a dog sitter, my apartment requires me to go to the front to check in guests, and i literally couldn’t make it that far. If I had the money, I would have gone to the hospital in an ambulance, that’s how sick I was. It’s really setting in how alone I am in my new state. I feel so guilty and like a horrible mom. I hate seeing my baby in pain and knowing it’s my fault. Raising a dog alone is extremely hard sometimes, something you might not think about until you’re in this situation. ): I wish I had a partner to help me.

Closing credit card accounts,"I was always under the impression that open credit cards with no balance helps your debt to income ratio. However, I got some conflicting advice. 

I got a small court settlement and I’m paying off all my debts. I was just going to keep the cards open and not use them. A family member told me that my assumption was wrong and even if there is no balance, that the available credit goes against my DTI. 

Can someone shed some light on what my best course of action should be? Should I close the accounts on the cards that I plan to not use again? Other than one card that I’d use for points, I was going to keep my Best Buy account open just incase I want to buy something and use the 0% promo going forward.

Avant Personal Loan Bank Account Question,"Hello! Not sure who all here has used Avant for a personal loan before but I have been filling out the application and entered the bank account information for where I would like the funds to be deposited to, however when I uploaded my pay stubs, the bank account where my job direct deposits is a different account. Basically, when I called to check on my application status, they said that because these accounts are different, they need me to provide my account # and routing # for the account tied to my pay stubs so they would deposit the loan in that account instead.

Is it weird that they asked me to provide this over the phone? The person had a Jamaican accent and said they made a note that I would call back since I kinda got weirded out. I did call the customer support phone number on their website, they did not call me, but still thought it was strange. Anyone else go through this?",0,1731605816.0
Breed recommendation for second dog?," 1)	Will this be your first dog? We have a neutered, 6.5 year old male Aussie. He is well trained. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder] We're not opposed to either but we went through a breeder for our current Aussie. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog. Gets along well with dogs, toddlers, cats, likes hiking. Social, confident. I don't have a coat preference but my S/O doesn't seem to like short coat breeds. She says she likes fluffier dogs. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? Golden Retriever, Duck Roller and another Aussie all seem to fit the bill. We'd kind of like to try something different, but another Aussie would also be fine. S/O is most interested in Golden's, I'm just concerned about their activity ceiling - will they be able to hike with my current Aussie and I? I also love Berners but have the same activity concerns, and my S/O is anxious about the short life span. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? Tricks will be pretty basic, but good socialization is an absolute must. We take our dog everywhere we are allowed to take him.

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? Hiking. My current Aussie and I will do 6-12 mile hikes in the Catskills, cold weather only - but long hikes through what is for him sometimes chest deep snow. I want to ensure what ever dog we get next can keep up with him. I understand a puppy can't go right into that, we will build it up, but I want to know it's ""ceiling"" should be decently high. 

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? We both work from home. A two mile morning walk is pretty standard with multiple fetch, play or short training sessions throughout the day. 

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? We keep our dog very active between hiking, walking and playing. We currently have about two to three hours of dedicated dog exercise time and are expecting to increase this for at least the first year of a new puppy's training. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? We do some home grooming and bathing but routinely take our Aussie to a groomer as well. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for? 30 pounds or higher, Ranger is about 50 pounds and we want a dog that feels comfortable playing with him. 

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? We have an Aussie, our life is shedding. We trained him not to bark reactively at people walking by the house, so as long as the new dog can be trained similarly, barking isn't an issue. As far as slobber, equal or less than a Bernese. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? Not important. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? Snuggly preferred but open to suggestions if they check our other boxes. 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? Sit stay come discipline is an absolute must and we will train this religiously. Outside of that, we're flexible. 

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  Greet, yes. Barking is okay too if they're coming into the property, just don't get aggressive. 

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? We want to avoid any breeds where this is a known issue, but would work with our puppy to try and correct it if it happened. 

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? Aggression of any kind. We have a toddler and a cat. 

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone? Rarely and when it does happen never more than six hours. We work from home and when we can't take ranger with us, he goes to my in laws or a doggie daycare. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? S/O and I agree on just about everything and split dog responsibilities evenly. 

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they? We have a 3 year old neutered siberian cat and we imagine we will get a second one at some point. 

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? Daily. For its entire life. 

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? We own and will keep owning, no restrictions. 

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? My municipality has no breed bans, but I don't think I want any breed that is commonly regulated as we may move in the next few years. USA, north east. 

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? Summers peak in the 90s, humid, winters bottom out below 10 overnight. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25)	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Best dog food with comparable price to purina beneful dry kibble?,"I have a quasi-rescue and let's just say I have to feed a lot of dogs every day. It's pretty expensive. I love that purina beneful dry dog food meets wsava guidelines as far as I know, and of course that chicken is the first ingredient. It seems like a not low quality but medium range kibble and I don't feel guilty for feeding it to the pups. This said, so many bags have arrived to me soggy and blown up with moisture or dry and every piece of kibble clumped and coated in white mold. I'm hoping to try another brand that will have me feeling guilt-free for feeding, with comparable prices to 16-20 USD for 14lbs of kibble. I don't mind a few dollars more per bag, I just don't want to pay $30 a bag if I don't have to. I'm not sure why these bags are delivered to me with issues but I just hope switching to a different bag will fix this problem. Please give me suggestions to check out!!

"What dog would be good for an active lifestyle, but living in a smaller apartment? ","\*\*Introduction\*\*

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
ANSWER: This will be the first dog that *I* own, I have wanted a dog ever since I learned what dogs were. But due to different situations I have never been able to have my own. However, I grew up with a dog who lived with my grandparents. She was a big dog with a lot of energy in her early years, but we became very good friends regardless.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]**  
ANSWER: Right now I would prefer a breeder, however I am very open to rescue in later years!

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**  
ANSWER: I am looking for a dog who wants to go on adventures with me and come with me to the stables! Who is kind to other animals/dogs/horses/kids. I would like a dog who likes to learn stuff and just explore the world and be friends with me!

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
ANSWER:   
My favorite breed has always been **golden retrievers**, and I guess it has always been the idea, as well when I imagine the future it's often a Golden I see..   
They are very kind and work well with both kids and other animals. They are also, *from my understanding*, quite adaptable and just “happy to be here”. However, it is a big dog and I am questioning if it would be cruel to keep a Golden in an *apartment*, despite my active lifestyle..

I have also looked into **Australian Shepherds**, because I really like them but I don't think I'll be able to give one a fair life the way me and Aussie dog wants.  
  
I have looked into smaller dogs such as **Daschhounds** and **Cavapoos** (which is the dog my parents are gonna get next month.. do not ask about the timing of them getting a dog right after I move, when I have asked for a dog for 18 years xD) but I don’t think that of a small dog would be comfortable with the work and adventures I want to do.. However I'm open if you want to change my mind!  
  
**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
ANSWER: I really want to teach it fun and creative tricks and give it meaningful tasks. I am still learning a lot about trick-training.. I also have a friend who does “nose work” where her dogs learn to search and find stuff, which seems cool! I have also wanted to do agility ever since I was a kid, and I live pretty close to a “park” where you can do stuff like that!   
  
**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
ANSWER: Like I said before, I don’t have *that* much experience with dogs, but I learn very fast and I am very interested in dog training as well! I have a few people who I think can help me on the way too! I really want to do some trick training, not only “sit”, “paw” or “roll” but more fun, creative and difficult things!   
If it likes agility it's more of a bonus.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
ANSWER: I will try to be with my dog as much as possible, both train it and play with it multiple times/day. Of course it might vary if I like have the flu or something, but I have a lot of people around me who can help me so the dog will never be alone or forgotten. But like I said before, I am looking to bring it with me on adventures and also to work, since I want to work on some kind of farm where dog can roam free a bit.

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**    
ANSWER: I would like to think I am quite the active person. And when I don’t exactly enjoy running, it might be something that a dog will teach me to enjoy xD   
However I do love long walks through the neighborhoods, in the countryside and in the forest. I live in the “farmlands” of Sweden so we have a ton of forests and fields to play fetch! There is also (i think) a dog park pretty close to us, and like I said my parents are getting a dog, so once I get a dog it will be able to naturally socialize with both people and dogs.

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
ANSWER: I am used to groom- and care for horses, which isn’t exactly the same but I have still learned about animal care, brushing and stuff like that. And whilst I’m not exactly a professional I am pretty sure I will learn, and the things I don’t know how to do I will ask to someone who knows! 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

**10) What size dog are you looking for?**  
ANSWER: The ideal would be a medium size/bigger dog. Like a *Golden* or a Lab*,* but like I said before; I have the dilemma of living in a smaller apartment but still having an active lifestyle. I really do not want a dog who will be sad because it feels trapped or like it can’t zoom around in the inside.

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
ANSWER: Shedding is fine, I can vacuum and brush it outside. Slobber can be cleaned up as well. Barking however might make Mr. Landlord quite unhappy.. I mean, it’s a dog and it’s not like I can just make it not bark, but I would prefer a dog who doesn’t bark at every leaf that hits the window..

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
ANSWER: It is very important to me since I want to have it loose when I do farm work or hike in the forest. Therefore I can’t have a ""reactive"" dog or a dog with too strong hunting instincts.. Even though the first thing I will teach it will be “recall” or “leave it”, I still don’t want it to go run off after some poor hamster or bark at some toddler. Especially in the woods since Sweden has quite some wild life, like moose and the super pigs (the  evil ones with teeth). 

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
ANSWER: I love to cuddle and I don't mind having a dog who wants to be close.

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**  
ANSWER: I would love a dog who likes to work and learn new stuff. But I want it to *want* to do stuff and follow me around on adventures. 

**15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**    
ANSWER: I do not want it to be super reactive.. I would rather it asks a robber for belly rubs instead of barking and risking making someone angry. I will do the protecting in case of a robbery, and I would rather fist fight a bear than having my hypothetical dog get hurt.. xD 

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
ANSWER: No.

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**  
ANSWER: Like I think I said before, I don’t want it to have any super hunter instincts.. 

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
ANSWER: Not for long, maybe an hour or two at a time max. However, I will train it to be alone in case of emergencies as well as to prevent separation anxiety. If I have to be gone for long I will find a dog sitter because I do not want it to be stuck inside regardless of what dog it is

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**   
ANSWER: I will live alone but close to my parents and siblings. I think they’re willing to dog-sit unless the dog is mean to their dog or the kid. And we will definitely arrange play-dates too! 

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**  
ANSWER: I don’t want another inside pet, however it needs to be friendly with farm animals, especially horses and cats. But also other dogs.

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
ANSWER: Yes.

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
ANSWER: I will rent (i think is the word) an apartment, and as far as I know there aren’t any legal restrictions on the apartment, however I might get a few weird looks if I get one of those huge fluffy ones 

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
ANSWER: I live in Sweden, and as far as I know there isn’t any forbidden dogs. 

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
ANSWER: I live in Sweden so the winters are cold cold like -20 Celsius, but the summers can be quite warm as well some days.

Looking for personal finance software to replace Quicken,"I've been using Quicken forever (20+ years now), but as the years go by, it just seems to perform worse, though it still has all the features I need to manage everything I need. My biggest gripe with Quicken these days is how slow it is to download the transactions for all of my linked accounts. It typically takes several minutes for about 5 accounts.

Over the past few years, I've looked at several alternatives (Empower, Mint, Rocket Money), and the biggest issue I've seen with them all is that none of them appear to let you manually add expected future transactions to linked accounts. I do this all the time in Quicken to plan out my expenses for the next month.

I'd love to find something that could link to my accounts like Quicken, but maybe perform a little bit better, and offer planning tools similar to what Quicken has.

Is there something out there that might fit the bill?

Need advice and would appreciate accountability buddies,"Hi everyone, 

I didn’t use to have issues with budgeting before but medical expenses and taking a job pay cut has made me start to become paycheck to paycheck and I need to start saving money before I go negative.

I am very reckless with spending money and it’s mainly due to variable mental health issues where I get into dopamine buying. I would love any advice and would love people to literally just tell me no if I ask should I buy something or spend money on something. It can be through any form of communication that you are comfortable with. It’s more helpful than you’d think if I ask someone if I should buy something and they tell me no. I just have very bad self control when I’m in that kind of mood but outside rational voices always helps.

So far I have this: 
- going to write down budget and try and keep track of expenses
- seems like hiring a fiduciary wouldn’t be necessary 
- I do have a savings account where money goes to every paycheck but I’ve been emptying it every month
- I don’t think I need help with tax related issues but I’m probably wrong

Should I use 401k to pay my high interest debt?,"I was working for a startup. Things were going well until they weren't. They owe me about $30,000 in unpaid invoices. I was continuously told that money will come shortly. Recently I'm getting the impression that it will be quite some time before I get paid. 

While I had no income I raked up about $15,000 in credit card debt. As well as about $4,000 that I owe to a family member. 

I have about $24,000 in my 401k. I could pull out enough to pay most or all of the credit cars debt. But I really don't want to do that. 

My fear is that to make any progress on what I owe I'll have to pay over $1,000/month which will be difficult and still take a low of time. 

Now I work at a Fortune 500 company. I have better matching at 6% and a pension. I'm planning to stay for life if possible.

I'm 39 now. If I take out $15,000 from my pension to pay debt will I have plenty of time to make it back? It is this a bad move? 

Thanks!

Edit: Well, that was quick. I'll probably just consolidate the credit card debt with a loan from my bank. The CC interest will kill me.",0,1731677082.0
Reading to my new dog,"To make a long story short, I have a newly adopted dog that’s super sweet but still shy/adjusting to the house. I also signed up to do some volunteer work soon that involves reading to young students. I love reading (and I read for pleasure all the time), but it’s been years since I’ve read a book aloud. I’ve been planning to warm up a bit so I can practice my tone, emphasis, and all the other stuff that makes hearing a story really engaging. 

Would reading aloud while my dog hangs out on the couch be enriching in any way? Or maybe help with bonding? Of course I won’t be working on his literacy, but I was just wondering if there might be some benefit to using him as my practice audience vs practicing alone. Seems like it could be relaxing and nice to have him get used to my voice.

Edit: I really appreciated hearing everyone’s experiences. I have been reading to my dog for the past couple evenings, and he seems to enjoy it when I do voices and show him the pictures. And my first time reading to the kids went great too! Thank you!",1,1731871051.0
Can I reduce income tax liability by withdrawing from my inherited IRA at a lower value and investing in the same funds?,"I recently inherited an IRA account from my father. If I rebalance it and put the whole thing into an index fund which I plan on holding long-term in my brokerage (taxable investment account), wait for it to drop in value, and then withdraw it and use the funds to buy the same index fund in my taxable account, would this effectively reduce my tax liability? From my understanding I pay 24% federal and 4% tax on the amount withdrawn not the cost basis; in this scenario cost basis is almost irrelevant. For example:

1. **Inherit an IRA, let's say it's worth $500,000.**
2. **Transfer it to an inherited IRA held at the same firm as the brokerage.**
3. **Rebalance the whole account to VTI, QQQM or similar.**
4. **Three possibilities:**
   * **The market drops and the value falls to something like $300,000.**
      * **I withdraw the $300,000 and pay taxes on it, transferring it to the brokerage account and buying the same index fund immediately.** Because of the lower value at the time; I would pay lower taxes. Very long term, I'd expect the index fund to rebound and I don't need the funds immediately.
   * The value does not meaningfully change in the inherited IRA.
      * I'd transfer assets out in kind to brokerage and hold them long-term, paying the same taxes as if I immediately withdrew the money
   * The market does really well and the account and shares are worth much more than before
      * **I'd pay more taxes**, but I'd also have more money and a higher cost basis in the new account. I could be in a worse situation financially, for sure.

Apt lease got falsely sent to collections and management said I have to check my credit after ,"
I signed a lease in January for an apartment to rent for the school year. In July, I decided I wanted to live with my boyfriend instead and looked for someone to take my lease. Another girl signed on and took the lease, the girl at the leasing office told me that I was done with the whole process. 

Fast forward 3 months, I keep getting rent notifications which I assumed was their clerical error to keep me in the system. Then I get an email saying they’ve sent the full amount of the year’s lease to collections— $16,000+. 

This starts a whole process where ultimately the manager says my balance is zero but  “In addition, it will be your responsibility to contact the credit bureau and present them with the FAS to show that there is no balance due.” 

I checked my credit score for free at Experian and it says that there is no debt. Is there any measures I should take in regards to “contacting the credit bureau” because it seems like it’s hard to talk to a real person there. Also if there is no outstanding debt currently, will I have to keep calling back to check?

Toy suggestions? - something safer than a craft pom pom,"Hi! My 55lb lab/dooodle mix’s favorite toy right now is a craft pompom (he found it during a craft day with our toddlers) and it’s a bit smaller than a ping pong ball. It goes pretty far in his mouth sometimes and I worry it will cause problems.

He loves catching it, throwing it up in the air, running after it, and generally being a goofball with it. Larger toys he tends to destroy.

"I've followed Ramsey's Baby Steps up to this point. Now that I'm in BS 4/5/6, should I consider a different approach?","I'm looking for whether there are better options toward my plan, now that my wife (45f) and I (38m) are out of debt (besides the mortgage). My plan is below, but I'm open to hearing from you all!

Basic details about our situation:

* Gross income is $210,000
* Loan on new home is $664,000. 30 years at 7.1% and monthly mortgage is $4,473. If rates go down in 12-24 months, we'll refinance.
* We have about $100,000 saved for retirement.
* We have two kids in the home with us, ages 16 and 5.

**Baby Step 4 - Save 15% for Retirement**

We currently are saving about 19% of our gross income toward retirement. These are our monthly contributions. The plan below allows us to max out employer matching and Roth, outside of my wife's contributions because she does not receive any employer match. Anything different we should be doing here, perhaps taking my wife's $250 and putting it toward a college fund?

* $834 that I contribute through my employer's plan
* $1,007 contributed by my employer to that same plan
* $250 that my wife contributes
* $1,166 that we contribute to our Roth IRA

**Baby Step 5 - Save for College**

I work in higher education, so it's completely possible that one or both of our children can benefit from tuition remission down the road. Our first daughter did this, and when I left for a different institution, the three of us were able to bankroll her tuition. As we're new to this stage, we are open to recommendations here.

**Baby Step 6 - Pay Off Home**

As mentioned, our monthly mortgage is currently $4,473. We plan to pay an even $5,000. Online calculations show that doing so will allow us to pay the home off 8 years early, even if we never refinance. I do wonder if putting that additional $527/month toward college would be more beneficial. If so, would there be a split that makes more sense to benefit our oldest, as he is 2.5 years from starting college and pour more into our youngest's account when he is done.",0,1732042654.0

Advice Needed: Should We Move Next to My Mom’s House and Sell Our Current Home?,"My wife and I are considering buying the house right next to my mom's. She’s our babysitter and watches our child for free, but right now, we drive about 40 minutes each way to drop him off before work. Our current house is valued around $400,000 (we bought it for $280,000 at a 3% interest rate with a VA loan). Our monthly payment is about $2,000. If we sold now, we’d probably net around $130,000 after realtor fees, thanks to the improvements we’ve made.

The house next to my mom is listed at $210,000, though I think we could negotiate it down to $200,000. It needs some work, but I know a solid contractor who lives a few houses down. I’d likely set aside around $20,000 for initial renovations. However, the local public schools aren’t highly rated, which is a concern. There’s a good private school nearby, though, with tuition around $6,000 a year until high school, where it increases to $12,000 annually.

One hesitation I have is due to a major construction project planned near our current home — one of the biggest developments in the area. This project could significantly increase our home’s value over time, so I’m worried about potentially leaving money on the table by selling too soon.

On the other hand, moving next to my mom would mean a lower mortgage at around 6% with a VA loan, making our new monthly payment roughly $800 — saving us $1,200 each month. We could even opt for a 15-year loan and still have manageable payments.

Is the proximity to family and the lower mortgage worth it, even if we risk missing out on future appreciation of our current home? Any advice or personal experiences would be really helpful!",0,1731941869.0
Advice needed for financial planning at 22 y/o,"I’m entering into investing a little later than I would like after I realized my money is stagnant in my current student savings account. Need advice on how to plan my money and how much I can actually invest and where to invest it.

- Work 20 hours per week at rate of $30/hr
- No significant need to use money other than on groceries and car payments, roughly $500-$600 per month

Why would I ever do a HSA?,"I did a HSA once. For a year, I had to pay for basically every out of pocket. Any money I made in the account got ate up by having to spend it on medical care.

Currently have 20k in debt and might have to add more. ,"I currently have about 20K in debt not counting student loans. The debt is a mix of personal loans and a couple of credit cards all with interest around the 21% range. The student loans I have is about 24k. I make a monthly payment on them but because of my field of study and work anything that’s left over after 10years (only 8 years more to go) gets forgiven.

I turn 30 next month and have been really trying to get all of the personal loans and credit cards paid off so I can start this next decade with a fairly clean slate.

However, I’ve recently found out that one of my parents has cancer. It was caught really late due to them not going to regular doctors exams. (They just don’t like going to the doctor.) In reality they will probably pass away before 2026.

I just learned yesterday that they do not have any life insurance. So my sibling and I will be paying out of pocket for all of the funeral and burial expenses.

The parent has zero savings, no investments, nothing of real value that can be sold. They do have a lot of “stuff” so there might be a few hundred dollars that we can get by selling things off.

The house is paid for so there isn’t a mortgage or anything to have to worry about. Selling the house would be a last resort option. We’d like to keep it that way the other parent has a place to live without having to worry about paying rent. Also the property taxes are less than 1k a year and it’s been remodeled within the last 10 years so there shouldn’t be any big maintenance issues pop up.

Basically I’m stressed out and looking for advice on how to prepare for planing to pay for the funeral arrangements and also still be able to pay down my debt.

A bare minimum funeral would be about 10k to 15k because there is absolutely nothing pre planned for it, not even burial plots. The total that I came up with based off of averages and because I’d rather be over prepared than underprepared is $20k.

So with half of the funeral expenses and my debt I have to figure out how to get an extra $30k.

I work full time. I’m currently on restrictions at work due to an injury but plan on getting as much over time as I can once the restrictions are lifted. I have also been applying for part time jobs that I can do in the evenings and on weekends. I cancelled all extra spending services like streaming, routine chiropractic care, etc a couple months ago. I’m seriously thinking about going on a ramen noodle diet $0.30 package of ramen noodle 2x a day until I’ve got things paid off. I don’t eat out very often which is now going to be even less if at all.

I also deliver groceries on the side for extra cash but the extra wear and tear on my car concerns me.

My base annual income with my full time job is around $36k. That does not include the grocery delivery, it’s only a couple hundred a month. Is there anything else I can do?",0,1732479820.0

Struggling with decision about foster dog,"A couple weeks ago, I brought home a golden retriever mix to hopefully foster-to-adopt.  I have a small poodle mix who is pretty fearful, and I knew it would take work to successfully introduce them.  We were making slow but steady progress and had gotten to the point where they were going outside together (with foster dog on a leash) and spending very short periods in the same room with supervision.  Then the other night the poodle was bouncing around acting playful, golden tried to join in, poodle got scared, golden ignored his cues and kept trying to engage, and poodle started growling and chasing him off rather aggressively.  Golden kind of joined in- not 100% sure if he was seriously fighting or just amped up and reacting.  Golden has also showed some resource guarding behavior that I fear could end badly if the poodle decided to challenge him (which I think he eventually would, because he and my first dog got into it a few times over food, bones, etc.).

Part of me wants to keep working at it, keep trying to get the poodle to calm down and not be so fearful, try to teach the golden some manners, etc.  But my gut says this just isn't a good match.  If the poodle was just scared and avoiding the golden, I think it would get better with time.  If they were closer to the same size, I would be inclined to give it time and let them work things out a little.  But with the poodle showing more fear aggression, I am scared of what could happen if an actual fight broke out between a 16 lb dog and an 80 lb dog.

I'm feeling really down about this whole situation.  I'm exhausted from trying to meet the needs of both dogs while keeping them separated.  I feel like I'm letting the golden down by taking him back to the shelter.  I know it's not a failure per se, but I feel bad that things don't seem to be working out.

"10.5 month old mini Poodle is still mouthing, sometimes hard","I've had this dog since she was 10 weeks old. She's always been mouthy. For the first few weeks she did respond to reverse time outs and yelping for bite inhibition. But eventually she stopped caring about these things and the behaviour hasn't reduced at all.

She is constantly trying to nip hands and feet. Sometimes I can get her to stop nipping my hands by making a firm first so it is uncomfortable to bite. But there is nothing I can do about my feet and ankles.

She doesn't care about toys when I try to redirect her. She doesn't care about being rewarded when she stops. She doesn't care if I yelp, regardless of the pitch/volume. She doesn't care if I leave the room. She doesn't care if I ignore her and stop moving. All she wants to do is nip my feet and ankles and will not stop unless I'm actively pulling her away.

No amount of training is working. The groomer complained about the mouthing as well - it is a safety risk for both parties. Generally she doesn't nip hard, but it is noticeable and uncomfortable/annoying. Last night she did suddenly nip me harder after I attempted to ignore her nipping for about 30 seconds.

Dog does not want to leave house at night,"I rescued a dog last week that is somehow still fully house trained even though he was in the shelter for 9 months.

ANSWER: My first adopted girl was a pittie mix who turned out to have idiopathic aggression. My current boy is a very neurotic and highly driven individual. I would love to get a dog with a stable, predictable temperament so a reputable breeder.

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**  
ANSWER: Mid-sized for sure. High trainability is a must as I love working with dogs. And something considerably less barky than a sheltie. I have a strong preference towards long haired dogs.

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
ANSWER:   
Definitely herding group. The teamwork factor is the *it* factor for me. 
  
**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
ANSWER: I love training obedience. Just got started with frisbee too, but I would say I'm mostly on the practical side of teaching - bringing stuff, opening doors, cabinets, teaching names of certain objects, manners etc... just stuff that keeps the doggo's mind busy while being a helpful daily skill :) I rarely do tricks, but I like teaching those too.
  
**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
ANSWER: I'm open to learning. Whatever the dog needs, but obedience is preferred, rally-o is something I would like to get started with in the future, just for fun. I only have experience in ""everyday obedience""

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
ANSWER: I like structure... So daily schedules are always in style and they're adapted to my dog's needs. I'm home a lot. Training them to do nothing or to hang out on the couch is also training :)

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**    
ANSWER: I live in a big city, about half a million people, so I've adapted to 5 am walks near the river with some obedience woven in. Maybe some fetch, but I am careful with that, don't want any fixations.

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
ANSWER: Again, whatever the dog needs. I sweep and vacuum daily because it's relaxing to me. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

**10) What size dog are you looking for?**  
ANSWER: Mid-size. I live in a small apartment near green areas, I'm positive the space is big enough to manage a small and a mid sized dog, after all home is a resting place and not a playfield :)

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
ANSWER: Minimal slobber... I'm used to barking, my current boy 'alert barks' a lot and just likes doing it in general, but I think it's time for at least a slightly quieter individual xD

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
ANSWER: Safety first, long lines exist. I don't let my dogs off leash unless it's 4-5 am and nobody is around, it's just dangerous when you live in the city centre. We also have a lot of untrained off leash dogs running around. I am not risking my dog getting bitten.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
ANSWER: Snuggly! I love cuddly dogs. It's a must honestly 

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**  
ANSWER: I mean, I like herders for a reason :) Definitely eager to please.

**15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**    
ANSWER: Calm and reserved. The first one can be trained, but the second one is very important to me, as I am not a social butterfly myself.

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
ANSWER: I tried and it was really freaking hard. So no.

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**  
ANSWER: strong hunting instincts, it's just not for me

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
ANSWER: I work in research so I can take most of my assignments home, on days when I'm out collecting samples the dogs can come with me (my current boy really loves it). But there will be occasions where I'm gone for eight or nine hours. Whenever it's the case I make sure the dog is mentally exhausted before I leave so they can sleep off my absence and not panic. I live alone and don't have a family, so the priority on anti-separation anxiety training is very very high for me.

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**   
ANSWER: I live alone.

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**  
ANSWER: A 2 year old sheltie. 

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
ANSWER: No, but I always make sure they know what a kid is. I usually just ask my colleagues for training opportunities so the dog doesn't freak out when it sees a child.

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
ANSWER: I have a flat in another city but I'm not planning on moving there. I'm currently renting a place without restrictions and I always look for those, also mandatory ins*rance even when the landlord doesn't require it, just for my own peace of mind.

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
ANSWER: Europe. No breed restrictions though. 

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
ANSWER: Summer is around 35° and Winter -20/30° Celsius on average, but there are lots of anomalies so I would say it isn't a vastly predictable climate.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**  
I am open to other groups of dogs. The fact that I have a herding group preference doesn't mean I'm dead set on them, so if anyone had a breed recommendation from a different group, please suggest it!
I think I also forgot to mention my overall activity is pretty low, daily 5km walks don't seem like a lot to me when people are out there doing runs or long hikes with their dogs. I prefer mental stimulation to walking around  mindlessly:)

Should I rebalance my investment portfolio? ,"I have an after-tax investment account with about 90K in it. Almost entirely tech holdings, a mix of individual stocks and a few index funds and large cap ETFs (these funds are themselves almost entirely made up of tech stocks). Total account is +32%.

* You do *not* need *short* term disability insurance if you have a decent emergency fund?
* Long term disability is four times more expensive (for me) through a 3rd party vs a group policy at work.  The logic of ""you could lose your job, and therefore lose your insurance"" convinced me to switch from group to term for life insurance.  But I'm not sure if it's worth the cost for disability.
* If you have decent 401k savings, can or should you rely on ""hardship withdraws?"" instead of insurance.  I could contribute the amount that would be going to disability insurance to my 401k instead.

Just financed a car and having some regret,"Loan terms as follows ~23K, 78 month term, 7.49%, $370 minimum payment. Hoping to pay off as aggressively as I can. Currently have the auto pay set to $530. Should I throw all my extra income and savings at this thing? 

Is it reasonable to think interest rates will fall and I should pay the minimum until I can refinance for a shorter term with a better interest rate? 

I’m contributing to my 401k to maximize a match, albeit only 8% for a 3% match. Currently have 5K in a 4% savings acct. 

We’re also attempting to save up for a house in the next couple years. Both (M 30 and GF F24) currently making around 56k gross a year, splitting 2K with rent and utilities. 

It is a 23 Corolla with <18K miles on it so I do plan on driving it for a decade plus or selling it and getting something more below my means if that’s what’s best. ",0,1732080994.0
how to correct resource guarding and aggression in a siberian husky?,"Hi everyone, new to the community! I just need some insight into this beautiful doggy. 



This is my Roommate’s 6 year old Siberian Husky, Soto.



I recently moved in 4 weeks ago and it’s been a struggle.  At first I thought maybe the sudden change was what was making it hard for me but then I had 2 incidents where he growled at me (and even tried to bite me) when I tried to lay next to him on MY bed (I didn’t push him or sat fast).



I put a doggy gate infront of my dog and I can tell it bothers him. His owner lets him and his Yorkshire free roam the house, the rooms and the backyard when he’s at work. 



It’s been a struggle, he’s smart, only listens to some commands when it’s obvious that I’ll reward him with high value treats but he’s probably manipulating me.



When it’s just us - he walks slow, tail ALWAYS tucked, ears always pinned, mouth closed. Sometimes he’s licking his lips or aggressively licking his [paws.At](http://paws.At) first I thought maybe he was scared of me, but now I think he’s just standoffish/resentful. 



I feel like he sees me as a threat to everything he’s entitled. I think he’s spoiled, my roommate is a good person but I can tell he didn’t have the heart to train or correct Sotos behavior.",1,1728645087.0

[Breeds] Questionnaire: What dog breed should I get?,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No. I grew up with several dogs (2 Malamutes, 1 Husky, 1 Retriever, 1 Shiba) and had a German Shepard mix until 5 years ago.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference, but breeders are expensive these days.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* My favorite dogs I have had were at my side as a companion who I could trust to be alert and wanted to please. They are dogs I could trust not to run off or do something silly even if they were not on a leash. Ideally, it would be alert but not aggressively so. I love cuddly dogs, the more pets and kisses the better. At least as tall as my knee, and preferably not a temperamental breed. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I gravitate to breeds that are larger sized, and like Spitz breeds in general. I really like their look and so far they seem to be great family dogs even with all the extra grooming you need to do.

 Not a fan of the smushed faced dogs or the small breeds.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The normal sit/stay/recall commands. I want to be able to trust it off a leash when at home or in places where it is permitted like dog parks or out on trails. Overall responsiveness to commands is ideal.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No experience and no interest. I want a family dog.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I expect to spend most of my time home from work with my dog. I don't mind training at all, I trained my German Shepard and she was great after a several weeks. As long as they are keen to learn and there is progress the time frame is a non issue, but stubborn breeds are probably less ideal.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I live around the corner from a rather large park, and less than mile from a dog park in the other direction. I plan on doing an hour of walking before work, then a shorter walk after I get back. On my days off we would go to one of those parks for a while so they can get their exercise in.

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Brushing is a nonissue, I am rather used to doing that for my dogs. For the nails and ears and bathes I guess it depends on the dogs temperament while doing them, sometimes getting a professional to do it is the better option.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* 40-125 pounds, +18 inches at the shoulder

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I don't mind shedding, I can vacuum and brush. Slobber is a no go if they are drooling everywhere. I don't mind talkative dogs, it can be really cute or funny. I really don't like when they bark incessantly at people outside or when the doorbell rings or things of that nature. My German Shepard was ideal in this regard, bark once or twice to let me know someone is here, then come find me if I don't get the door.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I am rather hoping I can do this. It would be so nice to be able to sit in my front yard and just hang out with my dog without having to worry about it chasing after a squirrel across the street.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I want a dog who is snuggly but not one who will jump onto people. Cuddles and pets are great.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I am happy as long as they enjoy sitting at my side and getting pets whenever they finish what they were doing.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Do not freak out. I work for Amazon and the amount of dogs I see practically running through windows and doors everyday while barking like mad is disturbing. Like I said before, alert me that someone is here and then stay at my side and alert until I give the all clear. Ideally they accept whoever I allow into our house or whoever I engage with, but for total strangers alertness is good.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* My first Malamute did not like other male dogs, it is doable but only if they remain a solo pet in the house.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Spastic barking when people show up. General aggression to people (growling, biting, etc)

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work 4-5 days a week and am gone for 11-12 hours at a time. They need to be okay in the house until I return.
 **Edit: I am willing to get a dog walker if it is best for the dog. I understand they need to use the bathroom and need stimulus.**

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone, but my neighbors both have dogs. So I don't want to bring a breed in that might not get along with a Golden Retriever. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Nope and Nope

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Nope

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent, and no breed restrictions. But I don't think my landlord/neighbor would like it if I brought home a breed known to be problematic. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Urbana, IL, there are limits to how you keep your dogs outside (how many per shelter, leashing them outside in certain conditions) but I don't think there are breed bans. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* mid-80s in summer, 30s in winter

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I live in a 700 sq foot house and I have a small fenced backyard, but the neighbors own the fences and they are less than 3 feet high so leaving the dog outside all day while at work is not an option unless I hook them up to a line/leash. 

 I am worried about getting a puppy since I am gone for half the day 4 days a week. 

 Honestly the reason I am filling this out is because I am worried that the dogs I like would be miserable locked in my house for half the day all alone. I am just trying to do right by the dog and doing my due diligence.

How do you tire out your high drive dog?,"Hey everyone!
A bit of backstory: we got our girl as a puppy from the shelter around four years ago. Everyone, including the shelter, was positive that she was a rough collie mix. I thought fine, Collies aren’t really that high energy/drive dogs. Jokes on me: turns out she has strong percentages of Bohemian Shepherd and Malinois in her. The Collie part apparently is only in appearance lol. 
I’m running out of ideas on how to keep her happy. Our routine so far is:
-Three walks a day, an hour each time. During these we walks we do:

Did my dog do spite peeing? Please advise. ,"Hi,

so we have a  male 6 yo Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, not spayed or neutered. He went through puppy school and dog school. He knows basic commands like sit, down, give paw etc. He is healthy (except sometimes dry eyes and ear infections), we visit his vet regularly. He has a friendly personality, loves humans and especially kids, is quite food motivated and usually easy to handle, sleeps through the night, doesn't destroy things, etc.

Now why I am asking is, my husband and I just followed the vet's instructions to keep his paw pads short of hair  on the bottom side (where he walks on the street) and to keep the hair inside his floppy ears short. We are supposed to use a shearing machine that looks like an electrial razor, but with a protective thingy at the front, so you don't cut the skin or paw. 

I held his paws and head while my husband trimmed the fur between the paw pads and inside his ears. He struggled a bit, but nothing major. He got treats after every paw and every ear and three more at the end of the procedure. He was quite agitated and had the zoomies for a bit and kept shaking his ears, probably because the shorter hair tickled him (the vet did this exact procedure a few weeks ago, he showed the same behavior back then with the head shaking).

But then he jumped onto the couch and peed in a long streak over all 4 pillows, the blanket underneath and my husband's hoody, which he had left there. 

I had walked him like 1-2 hours before that, he didn't drink anything after that and his last complete body check-up was about six weeks ago.   
He has not peed onto the couch for the last few years, nor on our bed or any carpet or floor, only when he was younger and only twice on the couch (though never onto the carpet or floor). 

So ... what do you think? Was he either angry with us for tickling his paws and ears with the razor or was it more of a loss of control for him? He follows me almost everywhere, some people have said that this is controlling behavior, not protective behavior or that he wants to be with me because he loves me (which other people have been telling me). 

Is it anthropomorphic to think he was mad at us for doing things to him he didn't like? And that peeing on the couch was his telling us he didn't like the hair cutting procedure?

Do I need CPA or CFP for Retirement questions / strategy?,"Hi, I have maxed out my IRA, HSA, and 401K this year. I will getting a bonus and would like to contribute more to retirement even if it is post tax money. Lot's of guidance online, but I am not sure I am clear on the record keeping and tax implications of doing something like a backdoor Roth (if my work allows) or something similar. The types of things I am looking for help on:

* I front loaded my IRA in a traditional IRA before I know I would exceed the income limits. I am pretty sure my MAGI is below the ROTH IRA limits so I want to convert that. There has been growth on throughout the year so don't know if that effects the conversion or tax implications. Note sure if form form 8606 applies here either.
* I am checking if my work allows for backdoor Roth conversion in my 401K. If they do, I am also not sure the tax and record keeping implications of that. Is it easier than I think?
* I also may want to front load my 401K next year. How does one even go about that since its usually a payroll deduction? Or would i just have to contribute my full paycheck until I reach the max?
* Given this thins I may want to do would i need a tax advisor or financial planner? Is this something I would just need an hour with each one or should I have them review everything for they year. Obviously this can all be pretty pricey, but maybe its worth it if I cant figure out what to do here on my own.

Putting Savings in Money Market/Mutual Fund inside Roth IRA to grow tax free and pulling out initial contributions when needed. Acceptable or bad idea?,"So I'm thinking of moving a chunk of my savings into a Roth IRA to grow better in a tax-free account. It's my understanding that you can pull out contributions themselves penalty-free (any gains are subject to penalty, but the initial contribution amounts can be withdrawn is how I've read the rules). I understand that the annual contribution limits are quite low, so the maximum tax implications for the interest in a savings account are not a major concern, but I have several thousand left for the year I could move over. I see it as not much effort to save a bit on taxed interest.

I guess I'm wondering:

1.) Is my understanding of the rules correct?

2.) Is this too much effort for too little reward? 

3.) Is it relatively pain-free to request a contribution withdrawal from the Roth if something comes up that I'd need to access that emergency fund?",0,1731603456.0

Pay extra on Mortgage or HELOC?,"Hello,

We currently have a 20 year mortgage, with 17 years left to pay. Interest rate is 2.875%; balance is $158,000; payment is $1,000. (This does not include our taxes/insurance)

We have a HELOC with a $46,000 balance at 7.75%. We have interest only payments right now of about $300. 

We wanted to roll the HELOC into a new mortgage and refinance down to a 12 year mortgage to cut five years off our loan. Total payment would be about $2000 with a rate of 6.25%. However, I’m wondering if we should just pay extra on one of the loans because our current mortgage rate is so low. If we go this route, is it better to pay extra on the HELOC? Or our Mortgage? 

I’m hoping rates will come down next year, like everyone else of course. Maybe combine the two loans when/if rates ever get down to 4.5-5%.

Thoughts? 

ETA: I know, I sound dumb wanting to refi to a higher rate but liked the idea of combining the two to get them paid off in 12 years.  I thought with my HELOC being higher rate, maybe it would be a wash to combine them. But now that I say this all out loud, I realize how bad of an idea that would be. ",0,1731961562.0

Investments and taxes for US Non-resident Aliens (NRA),"The whole non-resident Alien (NRA) thing is so confusing, as if the US taxes are not confusing enough by themselves! Anyway, I am a NRA for tax purposes (for the first 2 years) but I live in the US and have a US DL and SSN. 

1- As per my understanding, NRAs do not pay Federal taxes on interest. So for example for fidelity's FDLXX I won't be paying taxes on the dividends/interest from it right (at least 90%+)? Will fidelity withhold the 30% and I should get the return later on 1040NR or will they withhold the right amount from the start?

2- Any advice which HYSA providers accepts W8BEN and doesn't withhold taxes

  
3- In my case it makes sense to have MMFs such as FDLXX or HYSA than other MMFs such as SPAXX etc. right? I know you can't give ""tax advice"" but some guidance would be nice

  
4- Any other advice from fellow NRAs regarding investments would be great! for example, I think if 30% is gonna be taxed from any other dividends and capital gains so it's not worth it to seek those higher risk investments

HSA or No Deductible Plan for Upcoming Medical Expenses?,"Hi all. I’m relatively new to this so bear with me.

Long story short: I most likely have some form of IBD. For one reason or another, I haven’t had time to get it checked out but am planning on having my first colonoscopy this year. I’m early 40’s and have an HSA with a small balance and could technically afford any out of pocket expenses that might arise in 2025. In other words, I could continue funding it and reimburse myself later if need be. 

The issue is that my employer only gives me $500 each year and the deductible is $1500 in the HSA plan. In 2025 I’m being offered a no deductible PPO and the ability to use any remaining restricted funds that are the low deductible PPO account I had before I had an HSA ($1500 or so that accumulated some years ago when I was on another plan). In other words if I switch to the no deductible plan and work through my digestive issues next year I’ll have no deductible and $1500 to use for anything health related. If I stick with the HSA I’ll get $500 for free but will have a $1500 deductible and will forever lose the restricted funds in the PPO account. 

One additional piece of info: the difference in cost between these two plans isn’t much…$40 a month. So in my thinking it may be smart to do the no deductible plan for one year to figure out what’s wrong health wise and have free “money” to use if I need it. But then again I could technically afford to pay anything out of pocket, invest money in an HSA, and reimburse myself later. Thoughts?

Got fooled by my dealer at 40K mile service,"I took my car into the dealership for the 40k mile service, which I thought would be a simple maintenance check.

"Approaching Roth IRA Income Limit, Should I lower MAGI and contribute or rollover","My Wife (34F) and I (32M) are about to reach the Roth IRA Income Limit and I am unsure what to do with my IRA. We have next to no debt outside of our Mortgage and are already making extra payments. She was recently offered a salary of $165,000, and with my salary of $80,000 we will be over the Roth IRA Income Limit next year if we don't lower our MAGI.

I have generally tried to help her with her finances but this one will be beyond my knowledge. She will be almost doubling her salary next year so its a very large increase in income for us. My plan was to get her to maximize yearly contribution to her Trad 401k to lower her taxable income. A few reasons for this, since her salary will be jumping so much she wont miss the money being invested, it will set her up for retirement, It might drop us a tax bracket and it will put us below the Roth IRA income limit.

Obviously if she doesn't want to contribute that much I'm not going to force her, and part of me feels like trying to force us to stay under the income limit seems like a losing battle in the long run. In an ideal scenario we will both get raises and promotions that will outpace the limit increase.

So I am asking to see if you all have some ideas, here are the main options I've thought of but would love to hear some other perspectives.

1. Wife increases Trad 401k to $23,500 next year, We are below limit, I continue to contribute the same to my Roth IRA and Roth 401k.
2. Wife contributes whatever she wants, I keep my Roth IRA but stop contributing because of limit, Double my Roth 401k contributions.

If you are wondering the Roth IRA is from before we were married, and I guess I just fall into the group of ""I'd rather just pay taxes now and just not think about it in the future""

||Me|Wife|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|

We play games for about 30 minutes.  Late afternoon/ early evening another 45 minute - 1 hour  sniff walk, before dinner. Then it's pretty chill for the rest of the day until bedtime. We do this every day. I feed them both meals from slow feeder/puzzle bowls.

Now, she doesn't do it all the time and normally when in the yard she lays in the shade or likes to chill on the deck and people watch. She's nosy.

Just randomly she'll come slinking in looking guilty as hell, and I look out and there's a massive hole. We walk 4-5 miles every single day. I don't know what to do, but the holes are driving me nuts. Any ideas?

Seeking financial advice for managing fluctuating income,"Hello everyone,

I'm looking for advice on managing finances with a highly unpredictable income pattern. Over the last few years, my earnings have fluctuated significantly:

* 2021: $22K (PhD)
* 2022: $120K
* 2023: $315K
* 2024: $670K
* 2025 \[me + spouse\]: Estimated \~$900K (inflated due to stock vesting)
* 2026 onwards \[me + spouse\]: Estimated between $200K - $500K annually.

I don’t come from a financially affluent background and lack guidance on sound financial practices for such irregular income. Currently, I'm maxing out my pre-tax 401k, utilizing backdoor and mega backdoor Roth IRAs, and investing mostly in VTI/VOO in taxable brokerage account. I am seeking a principled approach to saving and investing that could work for my situation.

My goal is to live a comfortable life now (eat out when we want, travel 3-4 times annually, drive a moderately nice car), and achieving financial independence. Any insights or resources on how to effectively manage and plan finances in scenarios like mine would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",0,1732345756.0
"Made a mistake with my backdoor roth IRA putting it into the roth account first, is it reversible?","Hey all. So it's my first year married. My wife and I file taxes together. 

I always perform a backdoor roth IRA, my partner is usually just able to do a roth no fuss.

I did not realize theres household MAGI limit on roth contributitions. We marginally do not qualify now for direct roth contributions. Problem is my partner already put money into a roth account. It is not invested yet though.

Can she in theory, move that money back into a traditional IRA, then back into the Roth to have it count as a back door? Or is the process ruined by putting it into the roth account first.

Advice on what to do with $45K,"Hello, im trying to figure out the best plan for some additional income I've gotten from stock awards at my job. I personally like to sell when my stocks vest immediately and then reinvest in some blended stock such as ETFs, or use the money to work on my house which is a fixer upper. But I currently have:
- an emergency fund built up
- all my debts are paid off except for my mortgage (which is 6.75% with PMI, I just purchased about a year ago but I've been putting an extra $800 a month to attack principal) 
- no kids, no marriage, 26 year old
- my 401k is going to be maxed out this year (I'll be hitting the contribution limits)
- I plan on contributing the max for a backdoor Roth later in the tax season
- I have about $24K invested in Robinhood primarily across a few ETFs and a handful of individual stocks, mostly tech heavy. 

I am trying to figure out the best use for this extra income. I'm in between putting it into the market (maybe into more ETFs) or paying down my mortgage principal to get closer to being able to remove PMI as well as getting myself into a better situation to refinance when rates hopefully drop. Am I missing anything? ",0,1732039358.0
How do I cope with never seeing my baby ever again? ,"I had to leave my toxic family behind and they didn't let me have my dog Lucy. Before this happened, they were considering giving her to me as she was only ever comfortable with me and they didn't want her anymore. But we had a big fight and I finally stood up to then in the heat of the moment. So now, they're just going to get rid of her. I'm now living with other family, so I still have a roof over my head, but it's not the same without Lucy. I just need some help to get through this. I'll have to say goodbye to her as well when I pack my things, it's going to be so painful. I don't know what to do. I don't know if this counts as a low effort post, but I just have nothing else to add, I apologize if so. 

Edit: I'm going to play nice and hope they'll be fooled by it. Then when I have her, it'll be over with them for good. Thank you all for your help. :) 

Edit: Big change of plans. My grandfather took it upon himself to help me. I forgot that the car they've been using is in his name and he let them use it because they are struggling with money due to their own financial mistakes. He decided to make a deal with her, either give the dog or he'll report her to the police for car theft. We'll see how it goes. She could return the car and not return my dog though. I'll try a few other solutions you guys gave me if so. 

Edit: So, she didn't bring the dog. I'll make another post and see if the other options work. 

Edit: So, I tried posting other updates and they haven't been approved yet, so I'll post them here instead. The odds were against me and nothing worked. Then, my parents ended up changing their mind and keeping her, so I would've been able to see her through pictures on my sister's phone. Now, they have changed their minds again and are giving her to my sister, so I'll be able to visit whenever they move out and see her again. I'll actually let them (my sister uses they/them pronouns) have her because she was more bonded with them, so it's for the best. I just hope they'll be able to take good care of her. Thank you all for helping me and giving me hope. :)",1,1728076958.0

Mortgage recast questions,"Under contract on a home planning on initial 20% down on a conventional 30 year mortgage. I have an inherited IRA sitting earmarked to be used for the house. Caveat is that I had an unusually high tax burden this year, so that’s money cannot be withdrawn until 2025 without an excessive tax hit. Tentative closing date is mid December.

Brought up the idea of recasting with our lender and they were very unclear/avoidant. They mentioned there is no way to guarantee we can recast, there may be a timeframe to recast which they couldn’t specify (ex. wait 6 months, which is fine with us), and there is nothing in writing from lenders that would specify conditions of a recast.

I want to put this money right onto principle next year and reamortize (to clarify we can afford the higher mortgage, but want to recast to have a lower burden month to month). Is this lender jerking me around? Why wouldn’t I be able to recast? Shouldn’t be able to find some kind of terms and conditions on this from the lender?

Pulling SCRS PEBA Account Money for House Down Payment,"Hi all!

So I was a teacher a few years back and accured around $12k in the South Carolina Retirement System through PEBA. I know the general wisdom is to always rollover those savings into a 401k or IRA, but in this case, it could mean the difference between buying a home vs renting a year or two sooner and potentially being able to make a move when the market is more optimal. As I figure with the hefty tax penalties, I'd probably leave with $7.5k to $8k. This would allow us to put a down payment down while also still keeping our buffer savings (we have nearly 3 months of income each). We both make around $51k yearly and each have a car payment for the next 4 years of around $400 each. Currently paying $1400 in rent, but seeing that mortgages could be similar and would rather be paying to own a house so that money is going back to us instead of a landlord.

How to pay for home improvements ,"My husband and I currently live in his grandparents old house. We have done some major renovations (roofing, flooring, other repairs) by saving, then using our credit cards, and paying off immediately which has skyrocketed our scores. For context, the mortgage was paid off in the 90s and the home is still owned by his grandparents who now live with family, and all the money we’ve put in the renovations are to be paid back once the house sells in future years. 

However, besides the flooring and painting cabinets, our kitchen is still extraordinarily outdated to the point it’s hardly functional. All our appliances are the same ones his grandparents had when they bought the house in the 80s, which they took care of until they got too old to. Now, our oven/stove, fridge, dishwasher, range hood, and even sink are on their last leg. Cherry on top, our countertops are literally stripped partialwood.

I'm so worried I'm not gonna pick a good breeder,"Hello reddit, I am looking for some advice.

I feel like I was robbed of my breeder experience since that was my first time, I've rescued before than, and just would like to try again but wanna do everything I can to never have that experience again.

Need advice on what to do with extra cash I have on hand ,"Hi all,

long time lurker, first time poster. 

Im currently 23, almost 24, and am looking for suggestions to improve my personal investments. Considering I’m young and I still live with my family, I’m not all too worried about taking some higher risk since I fortunately don’t have too many overhead expenses at the moment. 

Here’s my personal breakdown as of right now:

~5k in checking 
~15k in HYSA earning 4.25% APY

~35k in a Roth IRA spread across several of BlackRocks iShares etc 
~30k in pure stocks mostly focusing on tech (apple, microsoft, nvidia, amazon, etc) and am currently up ~15%
~2k in a 401K	 which Im adding ~1000 to each month and this going all in on the S&P 500 (reason for this being the lowest is because I’ve just started a new job)

 
What I’m really asking in this post is what would do with 10K? Continue to spread it around the market adding to my current positions, put it all towards VOO, or something else entirely?

What to Do If I Don’t Have Beneficiaries for My 401(k)?,"
I don’t have anyone I can list as beneficiaries for my 401(k), but I want to make sure my parents in Russia would receive the money in case something happens to me. They don’t speak English and barely use the internet, so I’m worried about how they would navigate the process if I name them as beneficiaries.

I’m not planning to die anytime soon lol, so I don’t think it makes sense to pay a lot to an attorney or set up something super expensive right now. Does anyone have advice on how to set this up in a cost-effective way that would make things easier for them? Are there alternatives, like naming a trust or involving a financial institution?

Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Edit:

 How would the process even work in this situation? Imagine people who have no idea what a 401(k) is—they’re older, located in country with banks under sanctions, don’t speak English, and barely use the internet.

I’m a 19 year old how am i doing so far,"
Hello, Reddit! I am a 19-year-old who started working full-time at the beginning of this year and decided to focus on improving my finances. I began investing my money in early October and wanted to share my progress with you all. I’d love to hear your opinions and get some constructive criticism.

I’ve learned a lot from reading other posts on this subreddit, and I personally think I’m on the right track. However, I’m eager to gain more knowledge and continue improving.

So far, my current goal is to prioritize maxing out my Roth IRA every year. Once that’s done, I’ll shift my focus to investing in ETFs on Robinhood. In my Roth IRA, I currently have around $6,000, which I’ve allocated as follows: FXAIX - 60%, FSPTX - 20%, FTIHX - 10%, and FXNAX - 10%. I think this split is fairly good, but I’m open to suggestions for improvement.

On Robinhood, I have about $3,500 invested, split between VOO, VTI, and GLD.

I also learned that having an emergency fund is an important step, so I set aside $10,000 in a 12-month flexible CD..

This is my progress so far, and I plan to continue growing my portfolio by investing around $500–$1,000 from my $1,500–$1,700 bi-weekly paycheck.",0,1731691220.0

Advice to better credit ,"Hi I am a 28 yr old female who is about ~$20,000 in debt. ~ $10,000 is student loans and the other ~$10,000 is in collections from credit cards. 

How do I begin? When I turned 18 I was offered credit cards left and right and I essentially accepted all of them. Basically I was young and dumb on the credit area. Anyways fast foreword to today. I have paid a good amount of the credit card debt I had but I still owe roughly ~$10,000 and it’s in collections. It’s been in collections since 2019. 

I know after 7 years the collections essentially goes away and it has on some of the stuff I already had in collections. 

I can start paying off the stuff in collections but I saw a TikTok (I know not very reliable haha) that said that you can pay off your debt in collections but the bad mark on the credit is still there. Is that true? 

And I did happen to speak to someone from one of the collections that I owe and they said it’s up to the credit bureau to take the bad mark off my credit. Is that true? 

My credit score is 590. ",0,1731707631.0

How to Handle Large Daycare Assistance Gift,"My wife and I are expecting our first child in February, and my mom graciously gifted us $25,000 at our baby shower today for daycare assistance. We live in a HCOL city, so our daycare is $2500 per month (we’ll be starting next June after we take our parental leave). How would you recommend investing the money before I need to use it next year? My hysa is at 4.20%, so I’m leaning towards putting it there because I’ll be needing to access the funds monthly. I’m already investing in SPY, so I could add it to that, but I’m concerned about having to withdraw from there as much as I’m planning to. 

Also, we’re still planning on paying for ~$1500 out of pocket for it, so the money should hopefully last for our first couple of kids’ daycares if we handle it correctly. ",0,1732403574.0

Quest Diagnostics and billing hell ,"I am going to lose my mind with the latest installment of Quest Diagnostics sucks. I am a Kaiser patient but went with Thrive labs for hormone testing because Kaiser would no do them. I pay Thrive 250 and they send me the lab request for Quest. I provide Quest with my DL and the paperwork. Initially I recall there was some question about the billing info for Quest and the girl taking my blood said she would handle it and pushed it through. That was February. Oct 4th I get a call from collections - they ask about a 2900.00 bill and I am floored. WTF. As they confirm my info they have most of my info right and I tell them I have never received a bill - they go to confirm my mailing address and tell me the one I provided is not what they have on file. I call Thrive and this whole debacle begins. Thrive was never billed. Their billing department, along with myself, have been requesting a copy of the bill for a month and a half and have never received it. 

During one of my phone calls to Quest I am able to find out the address they have for me is some random address at the other end of California. I have never even been to the city. Not a vic of fraud etc. No Relation. I was able to get Quest to lift the collections mess for 60 days, gee thanks. Meanwhile I have now called 10 times requesting the bill either ben emailed or sent in the mail to my correct address. I have also emailed billing 4 times. I have yet to get a copy of the bill to submit to Thrive. Nothing in any of my folders or spam in email - I have received other emails from Quest but never the bill. Thrive has also let me know, they have never received the bill either. Frustrated is an understatement. I want to end my gig with Thrive but am afraid to with the mess going on. Anyone ever dealt with anything like this? I dont even know what to do at this point other then endlessly calling Quest and wasting more of my time. ",0,1731612587.0

Is My Rescue’s Excitement a Problem?,"Hi everyone! I recently adopted a 1-year-old rescue, and we’ve had her for about three weeks now. She’s absolutely adorable and super affectionate, but I’ve noticed some mouthing behavior I’m unsure about.

Whenever I walk through the door, or even if I’ve just been away for an hour or so, she gets REALLY excited to see me. She’ll grab onto my clothes with her mouth and gently tug, trying to get me down to her level. She will be shaking with excitement, eyes closed, ears down, tail wagging ferociously, and holding onto my clothes. It’s super cute, and she’s never aggressive or biting hard. It’s more like she’s mouthing at me in excitement.

We’ve been trying to redirect her energy with a toy, which works pretty well—she’ll grab it and hold on happily. She’s generally non compliant when we say no biting, but if we use our outdoor voice and say “No biting!” She will kind of stop. But I’m wondering if this mouthing behavior is something I should be concerned about. She also likes to mouth our wrists and hands when she plays, again, very gently, never hard biting.

Is this something I should work on discouraging, or is it generally okay since she’s not being aggressive? Thanks for any advice or similar experiences!",1,1730341479.0

Breed Recommendations-If you have time," **Hello! As the title suggests I’m looking for breed recommendations. I did my best to fill out the template, and I will answer any additional questions or concerns in the comments**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be my first dog on my own, family has had dogs since I was very young. I was the go to pet-sitter in the neighborhood and have experienced big breeds and small breeds alike.

I helped potty train and teach basic commands for four different dogs in the past ten years.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I currently live in an apartment, and am mostly considering an ethical breeder so I can have a better estimate of the dog’s characteristics. (However I am in driving distance of a few major cities, so if anyone has a recommendation on a non-puppymill pet store please let me know! The only name I know of is Petland and I’m not 100% sure if they are ethical or not!)

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I am looking for a companion! Small-large breed, leaning more towards med-large. (Golden retriever size max since I’m in an apartment).
*I am planning on getting a boy, and don’t mind shedding or moderate activity levels. I want my future son to help me better myself through exercise (and I am planning on beginning before I get the boy to start good habits) and I am already happily planning on taking my son to nearby dog parks, puppy play dates, the lake, and even a doggy daycare once a week.
*I can confidently say I will be a crazy dog mom and provide the best life to my son.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I absolutely adore the golden retriever, and am heavily considering a show line puppy just to avoid that field line hyper activity level.
I also like the Keeshond, Samoyed, and Bernese mountain dog (though they are probably too big for me) and wouldn’t mind a mutt but I’m worried a mix will be harder to find.
*I do not like greyhounds, poodles, pit bulls (not because they’re “aggressive” I just think they’re too boxy for me lol) or intense herding breeds.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just the basic command with a few more intermediate commands, a recall command specifically. I’m planning on enrolling in a training class.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* no ♥️ 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 3-4 hours weekdays
Longer playdates/activities on weekends 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I’m planning on a nice long walk in the morning and evening on top of quicker potty break walks, and more intense activities on the weekends / evenings when I don’t work in the morning after. Walks around the lake and even swimming in the lake, doggy daycare maybe once a week, dog park trips, and play dates with family/friends dogs too.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I wouldn’t mind a thicker coat, somewhere between two to three times a week brushing would be fine.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* small-large, leaning more medium-large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Not a drool fan, shedding at any level is fine, and barking more moderate/controllable. I would like an alert bark but not overly talkative like a husky.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I want my dog to learn that recall command, so decently important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly dog 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* eager to please/ attention-hog dog

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I would love that alert bark to let me know something is going on, and wouldn’t mind an overly friendly dog like the golden. But I have realized that I still want to be the most important person to my dog.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* If I can teach basic control commands yes! But I’m not sure I could handle a German Shepard or similar.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Just that overwhelming aggression or barking habit.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* weekly during my 9-5, however I already go home during lunch so he’ll get a potty break in the middle. So realistically 4-5 hours max alone. Also have a family member in the same apartment complex who can perform check ins as need during puppy stages.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* my dog/son only

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* no other pets 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* middle school age siblings, but no young children in the near future.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I currently rent an apartment no known restrictions on breeds

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*I live in Oklahoma and I don’t know of any breed restrictions, however I’m not very interested in very large breeds or aggressive breeds that would be restricted.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* super hot (but windy) summers and decently cold winters. (Yes I am ready for walks during both)

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I will note that I am 23F and living alone, which is why I would love that bark to alert trait. And I do like the medium-large breeds just to look a little more threatening on late night walks, and for them to able to hold their potty a little bit longer. I am weirdly picky as well since I was one of those kids who read books about dogs when I was young, just looking for breeds I may have overlooked or pups highly suggested. Like I mentioned if anyone has specific places to get a pup from please recommend those as well. Thank you !

asked to co-sign parents' bridge loan,"edit: confirmation is all i needed. wish i could help, but i don't think this is the move. here's hoping they don't hold this against me.  
  
Hi all, hoping you can all help me out here with a sanity check.

My parents currently own a \~900k home with no mortgage. They worked with a builder to build a $500k home. The plan has been to sell the old home and buy the new home. The new home finished much earlier than expected and the builders are trying to close ASAP. My parents just found out so they're listing their existing home this week.

My parents want to get a bridge loan, here's how it works from my understanding:

This loan company will give my parents a loan for the 500k for the new home. They have also made an offer to purchase the old home for well below market value. My parents will have a few months to try and sell their home for more, but if they can't, they're stuck with the below market sale, but at least the sale is guaranteed.

They are okay with all these terms. I would not be if I were in their position. The closing cost fees and the lowball offer are what I would consider predatory, but the difference between the offer they've received and the value of the new home is more than enough to pay these ridiculous fees. They're aware of it, they're okay with it.

But due to my parent's terrible credit, they need someone to cosign on the bridge loan. It kind of blows my mind that their credit is so bad, that they need a cosigner for a bridge loan where the sale home is worth almost 400k more than the new home. It must be really bad.

I want to help my parents, but I need to understand the risks involved. My original concern was ""what happens if/when they can't sell the house?"" The answer seems to be: my parents get bent over a barrel and sell it for much less than market rate but still walk away with something extra. But at least I wouldn't be on the hook for making any kind of mortgage payment.

What questions should I be asking? My wife and I are close to being able to buy our first home, our timeline is Fall 2025 at the very earliest. What can go wrong that can affect our ability to buy?

Will co-signing on a bridge loan remove my eligibility for first time homebuyer programs?

Would this ding my credit rating, and if so, how long would it take to recover? My current experian score is 815.

Would this count towards my debt : income ratio?

Once the house sale is made, will the closing of the bridge loan ding my credit score?

Again, i see how awful this deal is for my parents. They're okay with it and willing to pay the predatory fees out of their profits. What are the worst case scenarios for me if I do decide to help them?",0,1732060525.0

Problem: Need to transfer an assumable FHA loan,"Need assistance, clarity, insight, please: 

In 2020, I served as a co-signer to help a friend qualify for a mortgage. 

I  lent my credit history for this to heppen.

I have never lived in this property and will never live there and I have not paid one
cent of this mortgage. My friend and her husband (whose credit was too poor to
qualify) have paid the mortgage for the past four years. 

I want my name removed and replaced by his... Naturally he is the party who will be assuming the mortgage because he - along with his wife - have been living in the house 
with their children and paying the mortgage. 

This is an FHA loan and it is assumable. How hard or easy is it to see my name removed

I'm not sure of my exact question but any advice on making the decision/would it be the right thing for both of us?

Update: I adopted him!! Name is Toto, shelter named, and i think i might keep it. Thanks to everyone for their thoughts. I did feel as well there was a reason for wanting to adopt him, and that perhaps my Scooter was guiding me to him.",1,1730386509.0

Travelling with a dachshund or finding suitable alternatives?,"Hi there,

My husband and I are considering getting a dog, specifically a dachshund. We've given it a lot of thought and are excited about the prospect. We live in a very dog-friendly city in Europe, next to two parks. I work from home, we love spending time outdoors and we fully understand the significant lifestyle change a dog would bring. We're willing to accept all that.

However, there is one concern that we haven't been able to resolve. We like to travel once a year for a month to escape the cold winter while working remotely. The destination (Madeira) is a 5 hour flight for us. We're not sure how we could manage this with a dog. Taking a dog on a plane seems stressful and dangerous for the animal and the idea of leaving our dog at a pet boarding facility for a whole month seems sad. Unfortunately, leaving the dog with family or friends for such a long time isn't an option either.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? How did you deal with it? We'd love to hear about your experiences and any advice you have. Thanks in advance!",1,1728332349.0
How to make urine problems more manageable while searching for a root cause?,"Adopted a dog a year ago from a local shelter. All they could tell us was that she had had a large liter of puppies prior to being surrendered to Animal Control. Her surrender paperwork said she was 4, but our vet estimated she was closer to 2. So as of today, she's likely somewhere between 3 and 5ish years old. We know nothing else about this dog's background or how she might have lived.

The thing we're struggling with is her peeing in her crate, particularly if we go out for the evening, and how to have it be less messy to deal with while we sort out any medical issues.

Let me be clear that we are working with our vet to address any medical issues. She's been treated for a UTI twice. Our vet also had us try Proin during her last UTI treatment. I am and will continue to see if there are medical things we can address to help her.

But in the meantime, it's really frustrating to come home after a few hours out at night and have to give her a bath and set the crate outside to be cleaned in the morning. If I put a soft bed in the crate, she'll chew it. If I put anything like blankets, I just add to what needs to be cleaned the next day. I thought maybe being in a slightly smaller crate might help her not want to pee in the space she has to lay, but that hasn't helped. She is crated when we leave the house because she's had a number of incidents of inappropriate chewing and we can't trust she won't pee in the house when left unsupervised (so this isn't just a crate issue). It is guaranteed if we leave the house in the evening, she will pee in her crate.

While we continue to work through any medical issues, and continue general housetraining while we're home, I could really use some ideas to try and make this more manageable while we find an actual solution to whatever is causing her to not be able to hold her pee in the evening. Last night we were only gone for 3 hours and her crate was a mess when we got home. I felt awful having to scramble to give her a bath close to bed time (but I am so thankful she is easy to bathe!). 

At what point do you try dog diapers? Maybe a raised bed in a larger crate with some pee pads on the floor of the crate? I'd really appreciate any suggestions or ideas.",1,1728697918.0

Dog doesn’t like ANYTHING I’m at my wits end ,"I’m at my wits end. I adopted a GSD mutt 6 months ago. She seems miserable despite my best efforts to make her happy. 

The ONLY time she seems happy is on walks (more specifically, walks in new places. The same old loop around my neighborhood has gotten meh. She doesn’t stop to sniff anything anymore or really look around at all she just seems like she’s on autopilot trying to get the walk over with. In new places she comes alive, wagging her tail, sniffing everything, head on a swivel looking around.

In the house she just lays in the ground death staring me or restlessly paces around whining. When I look at her she whines. Occasionally she comes to sit by me and whines at me and wacks me with her paws even while I’m actively petting her - it doesn’t seem to make her happy or be enough. Her tail doesn’t wag, her ears are back. 

I’ve bought countless dog puzzles, snuffle mats, lick mats, toys of all sorts. She has zero interest. She is extremely picky with food and treats, but even the treats she likes she doesn’t actually want if she has to work for them (like by trying to play hide and seek type games with the treats). She will occasionally bite a squeaker toy and then walk away, she never truly plays at all, even if I try really hard to hype her up. Zero interest in fetch. She will eat some chews but won’t touch the long lasting ones (and I have tried tons) so at most they occupy her for 2 minutes at a time. She doesn’t touch stuffed kongs or anything that makes it a little harder for her to get the food, even food she likes ordinarily. 

We do tricks/training for a few minutes a day, which she seems to do reluctantly given she isn’t super treat motivated. 

The vet says she is in great physical health. I’ve considered asking them for an antidepressant or something but I know I wouldn’t be able to get her to take a pill with how picky she is. 

We are walking an average of 6 miles a day spread out over 4 walks, so she does get outside quite a bit but she still seems miserable. 

She just seems very unhappy, bored and whiny. Is there anything I haven’t thought of? any suggestions? I feel like a terrible dog owner that my dog is so unhappy but I’m at my wits end. ",1,1729047894.0
Adoption blues. I’m losing it. ,"I very impulsively adopted a senior dachshund with no teeth, and arthritis yesterday. I have a 5 year old black and tan currently and I thought it would be nice to get him a friend. My husband wasn’t “sold” but wasn’t against it either, but I should have learned. I think with my emotions and not my brain and I just felt really bad for him. Really he hasn’t done anything wrong (besides a little pee here and there) but I’m just so completely out of my routine and I cannot stop sobbing. I’m resenting him from taking time away from  me and my first dog. He’s been the only dog for 5 years and I wish I could undo everything I just did. I can’t even return him because it was a high volume kill shelter and I’m worried that he will end up in a bad place. They still made me sign a contract saying I’d bring him back if anything happened but I’d never bring him back there. Will I stop feeling this way eventually? I seriously am like beside myself and feeling VERY dumb. My best friend is a dog trainer and told me this was stupid and now
I’m stuck. So not only do I feel bad because everyone is mad at me, but now I can’t even fix this situation by letting him go elsewhere because I don’t want to traumatize him anymore than he already is. 

I’m just looking for support. I know it takes 3 days, 3 weeks and 3 months.. but I don’t want to wait too long and make it worse on anyone. I just want my life back, but also feel bad for the new dog. I’m so distraught I can’t eat. ",1,1728359965.0

1.5 year old German Shepherd hates being left alone suddenly ,"I have had my beautiful rescue for about two months now. And we have started to leave her alone for periods. Started small, fifteen minute intervals, thirty minute intervals, hour interval. Completely fine. We got her to an hour and a half and the most damage she ever did was decide an old iPad plug was a chew toy that I stupidly left on the couch. 

Yesterday, I left to go shopping as usual. I had to block her from shooting out with me but wandered out. She proceeded to bark for twenty minutes straight. Which for my neighbours sake horrified me. She did settle but I was quite worried. I put it down to me forgetting to leave the TV on for her. And went ahead with my plans for tonight. She settled then I had to come in and out and I briefly switched out her long treat because I realised I gave her one I needed to supervise with so chose to give her something safer. I left, checked my camera when I got to the bar and she was digging at my door. Given I was scared she’d hit a wire I got home immediately. No damage, I sent her to her mat and quickly put some anti chew on the carpet (probably will not work and threw her bed over the spot). We ended up leaving for two thirty minute periods and she was completely fine. 

Am I doing something wrong here? I always leave her with the TV on and a chew to keep her occupied and she’s mostly been fine just this week she’s suddenly been very shaken when we leave. Should I just go back to leaving for short intervals? I always don’t fuss when I leave or when I come back so she doesn’t get worked up as well. ",1,1726435316.0
Reported a fraudulent charge. Bank looked into it and somehow found me responsible. Now I'm being forced to pay back the amount. ,Back in September I noticed a charge on my credit card in the amount of $1240. I immediately called the number on the back of the card and reported it as a fraudulent charge. Citi agreed and issued me a new credit card with a new number. They told me it could take up to 90 days to credit my acount the $1240. A few weeks go by (its now October) they issue me a credit for $1240. A few more weeks go by and every thing seems fine. On November 6th I notice a charge on my account for the same $1240. So I call Citi and let them know about the $1240 charge. They say they will look into it and send me a letter in the mail. Yesterday I recieved a letter in the mail saying they removed the credit and I owe them the $1240 because they have evidence that I authorized the charge. The evidence they have supposedly shows a UPS tracking number saying the item was delivered to my residence. I never made a purchase in the amount of $1240 and I never recieved the supposed package.

401k loan - is it the answer?,"29 y/o, $100k salary, $100k 401k balance. 10% employer match. 

Looking to take a 401k loan for $20,000 to “refinance” one of my existing loans.

The loan in question has a 10% interest rate currently with a payoff date of 11/2030. 

The 401k loan has an interest rate of 8%, paid back to myself, and would be paid off 11/2028.

With my age, salary, generous employee match, and the interest paid back to myself, why shouldn’t I take the loan? 

Seems like a no brainer as I have plenty of time to rebound my account before retirement? I may be biased, but I also feel like compared to my peers I have 3x+ the amount saved for retirement at our ages.

My dog is so anxious in our new home ,"I adopted a 7 year old dog who had severe anxiety. She was neglected and abused heavily, but over the past months she has blossomed into a confident and loving dog. She has slight separation anxiety, but nothing terrible.

I’ve moved into a new home today and she is a mess. She took some of her high-enrichment treats, snuggled on the familiar smelling couch, and is making an effort to control herself. However, she’s panting, she’s drooling, she cries her eyes out if I leave the living room (her safe spot right now). She’s scared to death of tile floor and won’t touch it (luckily only the kitchen is tile). She absolutely will not go into another room. 

Please tell me it gets better. I’m so excited to be providing her a larger home and fenced in yard for her to play (in addition to her normal walks), but I’m feeling so guilty and sad about her anxiety issues. She’s totally shut down right now. ",1,1727476605.0

Loan servicer changing PMI then selling the loan ,"Hi all,

Over the last week I got two letters from my mortgage servicer.  I just saw both today when checking the mail, and I do not know how this is kosher or what I can hope to do about it.

Their first letter was letting me know that there would be a new bank servicing my loan, and the second one was letting me know that my monthly mortgage payment was jumping by $400 to cover a escrow shortage.  

I know banks trading loans isn't uncommon.  It's happened three times in the 2.5 years since I bought the house. But the change to PMI is really confusing to me.  I didn't think that could increase. But it feels here like I can't even get answers because they jacked up the PMI and dumped the loan.

I am trying to understand the details of the document they sent explaining the escrow shortage.  There was a property tax increase, but just a few hundred dollars for the year, which would contribute only a small amount to the payment hike.  The vast majority is due to something weird with the PMI.

If anyone could help me understand, I would much appreciate it. ",0,1732312470.0

farm dog ,"Hello Everybody.

From reading the title, I am getting a Great Pyrenees / Romanian Carpathian Sherpard mix. I am planning to get 2 and I went to go see them. I was able to bond with two dogs pretty well but since they are 1 years old, I'm a little worried that they won't see me as their owner.

I'm getting them from a breeder (don't yell at me I know adoption is better but this lady was ethical and she is just donating the dogs now because she can't sell dogs anymore due to her health conditions). I drove for \~2 hours to where this lady had I think at least 20 dogs just roaming around her farm.

These dogs have already been familiarised with chicken, goats, horses, cows, etc. I was thinking of getting these dogs because they're for herding animals and such.

I've never had a great pyreenes and I plan to let it live outside on the farm. Could anybody give me some tips/advice on how to raise these dogs and if or if not I should get these dogs because they're already 1 years old which is practically mature.

Any advice would help!!",1,1727375488.0
I need financial advice on how to get out of debt and move forward with my circumstances.,"Where do I begin? My wife and I are 354k in debt. The debt being a combination of CC’s, Loans, Cars and houses. Let me break it down. 

50k in CC and loan debt. 
80k in car debt across 2 vehicles. 
224k in house debt across 2 houses.

Our current combined income is 157k between jobs and disability. 

My job pays 63,500k.
Her 2 jobs combined pay 65,000k.
My VA disability pays 28,800k.
Rent at the moment, 0.

My monthly incomes comes out to 5600 a month after taxes, 401k contribution.

Her monthly income comes out to roughly 3200 a month after taxes, health insurance, and 401k contributions. 

Totaling 8,800 a month roughly.

Our current bills a month are 9,000 give or take and by take I mean we are dipping into savings quite a bit due to diapers, gas, odd and ends, and whatever else that comes up.

Breakdown:

687 1st car
720 second car
960 mortgage 1 (rental)
720 mortgage 2 (rental)
Rent 2600
Food 1000
Credit cards and loans 1300
Utilities for houses 427
Phones 270
Car insurance 268
Subscriptions 60
Odd and ends remainder.

So we know we’re in a poor situation. We understand this fully. Although it may not seem that way, we do. 

Red flag number 1 is the rental properties. Here’s context. They aren’t rented because we’ve been working on them. Property 1 will be done in like 2 weeks. That will net gross roughly 1900-2000 a month is rent. Netting 900-1000k a month. Property 2 will gross 1400 monthly and netting 680.

The issue here is that they aren’t rented and that posed a significant problem because we’re putting out 2k a month paying for 2 empty houses. They are almost done and that will give us some serious relief. 

Red flag number 2 is the CC and loan debt. During renovations things have went wrong. Primarily we ran up these tools to fix houses and what not with a little play in there. Nonetheless our monthly CC payments are eating us alive(on top of the houses).

Red flag number 3 we are renting in a city 4 hours away. On the weekends we come down here and fix the houses up. This process was more than we expected with 4 kids. We’re paying for gas for 2 vehicles coming down here. More food, etc. I took a hybrid job in another city paying more which is why we relocated. Looking back, I wouldn’t have done this until the houses were complete. I recognize this, however the trouble is our reality now.

Red flag number 4 which is linked to red flag number 1 is that we are saying for utilities at these residences as well. That adds flavor to the mess(a nasty flavor).

So that’s our situation. Now let me discuss our options because thankfully we have some. I’ll start out with the obvious.

Option 1. Rent the houses out. Put the 2k back into my pocket, and earn an additional 1,680 from rent. Totaling 3,680 back into our pockets not including utilities so more 3,900. To note we’re going into our savings every month so realistically we can only use 2,500 of this to use toward CC bills. This is the extremely long game. It would take 14 months to pay off CC and loan debt at that rate with the additional 2500 and the 1300 we currently pay. This option pays CC and loans down but we are left with both mortgages, and both cars and no reserves for the properties in case there are vacancies and or issues. 

Option 2. Sell property 1. Currently we can ask 280 for it. We owe 148. After the realtors fees and exemption of capital gain tax as we just moved, we’re left with 120k profit. That’s enough to pay down all loans, CCs, and both cars when considering the continued monthly payments we’ll be making until the house sells. 
This puts back 2,980 a month into our pocket when you add up mortgages, cars, and debts payments. This brings down our DTI significantly as well when we go to purchase another primary home. However, we sell a valuable asset. Something we’ve done once before and I regret it, deeply. With this option all of our debts are paid off minus rental property number 2 which is 720 a month.

I have to state something for the sake of transparency. Our lease is up in 7 months at the rental. Our priories have shifted and we desire to maybe travel the country for a year with our family. This means we need as much monthly incomes as possible so our time on the road is spent to the fullest. This is not set in stone but we have a desire to give our family this experience. This means instead of buying in 7 months if we sell property 1, we buy a used travel trail cash and use our suv to haul it. We are on the fence about this or buying another house and finally settling down till the kids are older. We want to provide stability to them but we also want to experience this on the other hand for a short period of time in the grand scheme of things.

We have talked about buying another primary if we sell, and then shortly thereafter getting a travel trailer but then we have a mortgage while we’re on the road cutting into our spending funds. Substantially as well considering we are looking for a 5/3. Interest rates are garbage so our mortgage will likely be 3k or so. Not a great decision unless we have the mortgage taken care of for all months we’re on the road. (Not likely) 

Option 3. We take out a HELOC and pay off our CC debt. I know we exchange debt for debt but the monthly payments will go way down as opposed to 1300 a month in CC payments AND we get to keep an asset. However, this negatively affects our DTI when we go to buy another house forcing us into a house that’s either too small or that we just flat out do not want. There’s cash out refi but we would get a worse rate by probably 3% which would negatively affect our DTI and make the rental virtually unprofitable. 

Under the scenario that we travel, we sell one of the cars as we would not need it and if we did decide to go through with HELOC. We could pay it down while on the road but this would also affect spending power. 

Regardless of traveling, I have been so incredibly wishy washy with our decision because on one hand I want to get out of this debt ASAP because it’s crippling and on the other I want to keep the asset. I don’t think we’ll see the interest rates again that we have in a very very long time so I know if this is the decision we decide, then we can forget about ever having a truly profitable rental from the get go. 

I need some serious advice. What’s the best way to get out of this debt. Even if we decide not to travel long term and just take an extended vacation that’s ultimately better than nothing. We need relief and I need someone to help clear my foggy head. Thanks in advance guys. ",0,1732330703.0
Mega Backdoor Roth Conversion Timing,"My employer started just this year.  I can do an in-plan conversion to a Roth.  Long story short, I didn't do it right away. It has to do with a planned retirement that I have decided to delay due to the outcome of the election.

My question may be stupid but I feel like I've looked everywhere and can't find the answer - does the conversion have to be done in the same year as the contribution?  Or can it be done at any time in the future?  My employer keeps bugging me via email to convert, but I thought I could do it anytime I wanted in the future.",0,1731856085.0
Sit Means Sit - Engages in Deceptive Marketing Practices To Hide Negitivity,"Figured I'd make this one known.

Compulsive training company Sit Means Sit who uses deception to try to sell the shock collar training method, whose method uses negative reinforcement at an escalating level while pretending it's an ""attention getter"" has been giving the mod team problems on dog subs.

They're trying to get us to remove all posts critical of them while pretending to be lawyers claiming that critics are nothing more than ""competing trainers"" rather than providing legitimate reviews of their services. They *claim* that it's in violation of the FTC's stance on fake reviews, and are trying to use this to get us to remove those critical posts. There is no evidence of this, despite their claim that these anonymous people who don't even have their locations mentioned are simply competitors. We're leaving these posts up, and I'm posting this to make it known how they operate.

They've been engaging in abuse of the report button to try to shut it down, using the option that it's pornography, etc.

Interestingly enough, as somebody who has previously worked in marketing, the new FTC guidelines actually prohibit companies from removing critical reviews, creating fake reviews of themselves, and cherry picking reviews for their website to display. This is exactly what they're doing.

Anyways, this marks another reason not to service this company. Do not trust them. They're taking immense steps to shut down any critics, and due to the unregulated nature of the industry this makes them incredibly dangerous.

Has Hart & Hart’s Behavioral Matrix in “The Perfect Puppy” been replicated or extended?,"I came across this book a long time ago, and I found it very useful and interesting. Two vets developed a matrix of 13 behavioral characteristics (“excitability”, “general activity”, “snapping at children”, etc.) and asked 96 experts to score 56 breeds for each characteristic.

I found the book extremely useful and I looked for an updated edition, and I did not find one.

The book was published in 1985, which means the research is probably 40 years old that this point.

Has anyone published a similar book - maybe expanding the number of breeds covered?

Dogsitting advice. Can I dog sit a Shi-poo at my apartment?,"Hi all,

I am a life long dog owner (specifically shit tzu but also gun dogs ect). This week is tgiving week and I work in Fashion. I am also in business school. The combination of Black Friday and the beginning of finals is making my life very busy. 

My boyfriend’s sister sprung dogsitting on us last minute. She is going away for tgiving with my bfs family. I can’t physically leave my apartment rn due to he and work to go dog sit the dog in its home. I literally can’t bring my whole work desk, meds, and fashion event outfits with me (lol). 

The dog is a shi poo and I offered to take care of the dog at my apartment but my bf refuses. The dog does live in a house but we can take it on walks and accommodate its outdoor time needs. Also we live on a 4th floor walk up but I explained to my bf that we can just pick the dog up and carry it up the stairs. Also we can leave it in the bathroom when we are gone. My whole life my family took care of dogs for friends at our house. Ik the dog is neurotic but I can’t physically go with my bf to the dogs house. This will separate my bf and I for tgiving week which SUCKS.

"What breed would suit me best? Lovable, friendly, fetch/play, a little hiking? ","1)    Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, I grew up with an English Cocker Spaniel (RIP <3 the best!), and a Chihuahua who’s now 17 yrs old, still kicking it at my dads. 

2)    Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder].

I'd prefer to rescue just due to how I morally feel, but I would love to have a puppy from a breeder, I don’t think I’m home enough for a puppy though. 

3)    Describe your ideal dog.

Loving, wants to snuggle and be pet/loved. Enjoys playing fetch & gets along with strangers (my friends/family/maybe people at a dog park). Potentially also hiking with them! Nothing crazy but max ~10 miles, maybe an overnight if they like it. 

4)    What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Beagle, Lab, Cocker Spaniel, Irish Setter, Samoyed, Redbone Coonhound. They all seem like friendly dogs that enjoy your affection and strangers. Not agressive, not too big. 

5)    What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Simple stuff, sit, lay down, fetch, nothing crazy. Listen to me and don’t run off into the woods. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Not particularly but I'm not against it. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1-2 hours, more on weekends.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

~1 hour a day of exercise. I'd love to have a dog that enjoys playing fetch and possibly playing with other dogs. I don't have a dog park in mind but I would be open to using one.

9)    How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Fine with anything. My floppy eared cocker spaniel definitly started having ear problems as he got older but I'm not sure that was avoidable.

**Personal Preferences**

10)   What size dog are you looking for?

I would like a slightly larger dog than my ~25lb cocker spaniel, maybe 40-50lbs. But I'm open to any recommendations 25-75lbs.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Fine with it all.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Would really like it, but I don't live in the woods so it's not super important. I would like to be able to go to the school field by my house without the dog running off into the woods for a squirrel though. If I could take the dog hiking it would probably be leashed most of the time anyway. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly!

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Either

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Friendly, barking is fine but I don't need a gaurd dog.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Yes, but prefer something on the friendlier side.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

N/A

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

M-F 8:00-4:30. I am working on getting a remote job but at the moment I work in office.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

I have a parent willing to help but they also work M-F.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

17 year old Chihuaha, I have lived on my own in the past though and may move locally in the next year where the dog would be alone.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Not worried, saving for my own house at the moment.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

New York, unsure on any bans.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

I’m an idiot who contributed to a tIRA while making more than the income limit. What should I do?,"I (32M) just paid off a ton of tax debt and was focused on maxing out my retirement accounts for the first time in my life. I will make 40k from a W-2 job (substitute teacher) and 70K from 1099 gig work. I am covered by a retirement plan for the W-2 (CALSTRS, which is a 401(a) defined benefit plan where 10% of my W-2 paycheck is placed into a pretax retirement account). 

I opened my first tIRA this year and was planning on maxing it out. After I already contributed 2K, I read a post on this sub about the tIRA income limits. If I am above the income limits and I’m covered by an employer retirement plan (which is true for my W-2 income at least) I am worried my 2K tIRA contributions will not be tax deductible.

"Fix Used Car, Buy another Used Car, or Buy a newer Car? ","My wife and I have a 2008 For Taurus X that she has loved since we bought it in 2016. It now has over 200k miles on it and just recently started costing significantly more to fix mechanical problems with the car. It cost us about $1500 last year. We already put $2700 earlier this year for 2 repairs, 1 for an axle seal and the other for Front and Rear Struts. Now, we are facing another $2500 in repairs for Engine and Transmission mounts, Rear Lower Control Arms, Transmission Fluid, and Brake Fluid. And our feeling is that these repairs are going to continue to mount. 

She wants to purchase a lower mileage 2008 Ford Taurus X that we found about 2 hours from us that I found online. However, the cost seems really high to me. The price was $9999, but the total tax, tag, and title the Sales Guy gave me was $11,789. 

We have a decent amount of cash on hand, thankfully, so we could buy a new or a used car, but my wife doesn't really like anything that isn't $60k+. I know it seems silly, but she loves the Ford Taurus X because it's familiar, and the only other vehicles she has driven that she likes are either the GMC Yukon or the Jeep Wagoneer.

House move - anxiety or something else? ,"Moved apartments about a month ago, same condo, different unit. Doggo has been great 9/10, discovering the joys of having a balcony, appetite all good, everything normal. However, I've noticed on most nights she goes to the corner in front of the bathroom to lie down and hang out there. If bathroom door is open, she'll go underneath the counter (that particular spot is where she goes when she's scared during thunderstorms and fireworks, etc.) She doesn't seem particularly anxious since when that happens she'll usually sit up straight and not lie down and is usually shaking, which hasn't been the case.

When she decides to come sleep with me at bedtime, she'll first go to the only available corner in the bedroom and sit. She eventually lies down in that corner. I keep the door open in case she wants to leave and some mornings she's in the living room on her couch corner, or in her bed, or at foot of my bed (her preferred spot when we sleep together) or in her teepee which is in the bedroom.

I can't figure out what's happening, and if this is just normal moving stress / anxiety. This only happens at night. She is a rescue and was found roaming the streets. Unfortunately I don't know her history beyond that. She has been with me for 5 years and our other place was the only place we lived in before moving. We go to grandma's house periodically and she has always been fine there. Don't know her age but probably around 10 or so.

Can I use my line of credit?,"Hey there. This is nowhere near the financial struggle and tragedy that other people in this thread are experiencing, but I need some advice pls.

I went travelling for a few months and took out a $5,000 line of credit to use in emergencies. I was below my budget, and finished travelling with money in my account and an untouched line of credit! 😄I used my visa for all my payments while travelling, and payed it off in full on time for the 5 months I was away. This boosted my credit score and I’m happy with where it’s at.

I don’t wanna mess up my credit score that I’ve been working hard to improve, and I have this line of credit untouched. Can I pay my credit card off with my line of credit?

Does this make sense? Am I on the right track here or is there a better way. I live a low cost life and once I start working again I won’t have many expenses so I’m not expecting it to take very long to pay off. I’m mostly worried about accruing interest and damaging my credit score.

Need advice on a financial advisor or financial planner,"Hi, I'm 61, single (gray divorced), still working, living alone, no family  I have a 401k , decent savings, no debt other than rent.

Mid 20’s traditional vs Roth 403b and what to do with leftover money? ,"I am a 26-year-old nurse and have been working for a year and a half. My total income this year will be about 86k. I have maxed out my ROTH IRA for this year and currently contribute 10% of my paychecks to a traditional 403b and 10% to a ROTH 403b. I just adjusted this, as it was previously 6% to traditional and 9% to Roth. Is a 50-50 split between the two a good idea? I understand that it is the case of paying taxes now vs later, but can’t grasp how to apply this to my situation. 

I have 12140 in my 403b and 9500 in the ROTH IRA. I also have 28k in a high-yield savings account (4.5% APY). This is also the account I use to pay my bills/cc. I have zero debt, car payments, or student loans. I pay approx. 900 a month for my apartment/utilities. Should I continue to save money in my high yield account? If not, what should my next steps be?

Taking out loans for college - is my plan bad? ,"Ive been attending a community college for electrical engineering. Ive been paying out of pocket with personal savings and received some help from my parents. I'll be transferring to a 4 year univeristy soon and estimate I'll need between 30 - 45k for tuition and books alone to wrap up my last 3 years. 

I have about 24k in the bank, and make about $1850 a month working part time. After bills each month I'm left with nothing and sometimes have to pull from my savings. 

With how intense my course load will be after I transfer there's no way I can work what I am right now (20 hours/week) I'm considering taking out additional loans for rent at some point, which is around $825 per month, and quitting my job. 

In January of 2026 ill be considered an independent student and eligible for around $7500 in aid per year. (Right now I don't qualify for any financial aid besides $3500 in private loans) I'm set to graduate in spring of 2028. 

My major is in pretty good demand given the job market, and starting salaries are typically between 75-80k. 

Is this plan bad? I'd appreciate any advice

Husky puppy sleeps in kennel only in certain rooms,"So we have a 10 month old husky puppy. We have been having issues with her sleeping in her kennel. I’ll be honest, we kind of gave up on trying to train her to sleep in there for a while when we got her because she can be such a nightmare - never ending whining, “digging,” etc.

Well, we have to kennel her when she sleeps, because she always finds new ways to be naughty when we’re asleep. Or she has bathroom issues, which she is able to not do in her kennel. But for some reason, she is most comfortable sleeping in our living room - but one of us has to be out there and so do our dogs. Otherwise it’s the whining.

She is not comfortable in our bedroom - she will whine and dig and make lots of noise. I’m currently laying on the floor by her as I type this, so she hopefully she can feel more comfortable and sleep, but it’s getting really frustrating because while I feel for her, we need to be able to sleep, and sleeping on the couch every night is getting old.

We want to help her be comfy, but she tears up anything in her kennel. She even tore up a blanket we had on top of it by getting it inside through the holes. I’ve thought about getting one of those indestructible beds with metal sides so she can’t chew it, but I don’t know if it’ll help.

She seems to get either lonely or scared, or maybe even bored at night but I’m not sure how to help. 
She gets enrichment toys/food during the day, plays with our other dogs, and has lots of access to our yard, so I don’t know if there’s anything to do there, but I don’t think so.

401k and Roth with pension,"I have a gov pension in which I’ll draw 60% of my highest page salary which currently is projected around 85k but will probably be more like 100-115k by the time state raises are given over the next 17 years. 

I will retire at 52.  Currently 35 . 

Does it make more sense to invest in my 403b now instead of a Roth?  As I’ll have 8 years before turning 60 so my taxable income would just be the pension. No social security. Company automatically puts 3% in 403b. 

I’m thinking maybe 403b then at some point convert to Roth to be able to access the funds during those 8 years. Idk maybe I’m understanding it all wrong. 

Any tips/advice would be appreciated. ",0,1732379981.0

Finding the right veterinarian practice,"Hi everyone, this is more of a question but has anyone had a hard time finding the right veterinarian practice for your dog?
I’m a first-time dog owner. He’s 1yr. We’ve been going to a practice that my parents used to go to for this entire time, but the doctor we have had is a little bit weird and over the top. The last time we felt he tried to scare us into thinking something may be wrong with our dog and caused unnecessary worry. However, as far as treatment and his surgery being neutered, we have really had a good experience overall with that.

Thoughts on adopting middle aged/older dogs?,"I’m thinking about adopting a 5 year old golden retriever mix who’s been at a local shelter for the last month or so.  I haven’t done a meet and greet yet, but it sounds like he’s a good boy who really needs a good home.

My biggest hesitation is the age.  I know 5 isn’t exactly geriatric, but it’s not young for a big dog.  I lost my first dog (a cavalier King Charles spaniel) at 15 earlier this year and it was HARD.  He was worth every second, but caring for a senior was a lot of work and expensive, and saying goodbye just about killed me.  I’m feeling pretty hesitant about doing that all over again in the not too distant future.  Especially with a bigger dog who might eventually need mobility help.  I’m in good shape, but I don’t think I could deadlift a 75 lb dog into the bathtub, for example.

On the other hand, I could give this dog a great home. (Assuming he gets along with my current pets).  He’s 5 and being treated for heartworm, so he’s not exactly most people’s first choice compared to all the puppies at this shelter.  And there are some odd parallels with my first dog- same age, same animal shelter, both have/had heart issues, both almost adopted and then turned down by their potential families.  I don’t want to read too much into all of that, but it’s giving me pause.

Buying your own car and path to adulthood,"Hi guys,

I am 28M, single, and live with fam in the bay area. I use my family's car to commute and I make about $100K a year with savings.

I'm getting to the age where I feel like (also with societal pressure) I should have my own things i.e. my own car and my own place to live. However, I am happy living with family until I have even more money saved, and/or until I meet someone to move out with. With that said, I recently found a car I really like (mazda cx-50 hybrid), and I wondered to myself if it's time to buy my own car. With tax, fees, etc the car would likely be \~$45K, which I can afford. However, it doesn't feel like a need but more so a want. My family don't really use cars that much, except for me. We have a 2014 subaru forester and 2007 toyota camry which are very robust cars.

As I have implied, I feel like having my own car would be a boost in the current dating world. Though, I also recognize that it could also be my own ego/confidence talking. Would you buy a car in my story? How else would you use this money? I'm curious to see what other people think and if they have any advice for my scenario.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read and help!

Looking for a small/medium breed that won't chase foxes ,"
For context, our garden backs into a mound where foxes have a den. The den is past the limit of the property and there is a fence in place, however a dog standing in the garden would be able to see them. I was hoping to get small to medium breed recommendations that are less likely to get rilled up by foxes and less likely to bother them. Thank you! 

Questionnaire: 

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    * I've had dogs growing up but was never the primary carer / responsible for training so would say I'm a newbie at dog training.

    * Mild tempered, affectionate, short haired (not a deal breaker), could be left alone for a few hours

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    * Well I love terriers and hounds but I know they will be a no go if I want to protect the foxes. I love their intelligence and interest in the world. I also love Great Danes for their general loving and relaxed disposition and their goofyness, however they are just too big

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    * General tricks like sit, paw, lie down. Also want them to be responsive to recall and to behave when on a leash.

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

    * No, only want companionship

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * 1-2hrs

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * Walks for about 1h a day plus play time in the garden for at least 30 mins

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    **Personal Preferences**

    * Not a deal breaker but would be good to have

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    * Something in between would work well. So a dog that doesn't have much separation anxiety but also wants to snuggle in the sofa

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    * No preference
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * Ideally not

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    * My partner would love an Alsatian but doesn't mind the breed I choose. I would be the primary carer but he would take the dogs on walks/feed etc when I'm unavailable.

HSA + HDHP vs HMO - Is it worth it?,"Have had HMO forever but considering switching to HSA until my spouse and I retire in \~13 years at 55 for tax savings. 

Same in-network doctors for both plans, wouldn't use HSA for expenses until after retirement, would save everything for reimbursement. 

The large premium difference and potential deductible/oopm costs seem like they would eat into potential tax savings but I haven't found a calculator that takes all factors into consideration.

If we stick with HMO, we would invest the money we would of spent on HSA/HDHP (premium, deductible, contribution) in a pre-tax 403b.

Both of us are healthy but have some upcoming medical needs next year that will likely reach HSA plan deductible max, but hopefully wouldn't reach full OOPM nor be an ongoing expense.

Dog Stealing Toys at Dog Park,"So I take my 18 month old puppy to the dog park every so often. We have a good group of people but lately she’s been stealing the toys that other dogs bring to the park. One person for example likes to play fetch with their dog, and occasionally my dog takes the ball and just runs. She likes the chase game I assume but today the owner was not happy about it. I was trying so hard to get her to just come to me so I can get the ball but she was playing keep away. Eventually I stormed at her and was able to scare her or tire her out more? Idk but she eventually just paused and gave me the ball?

What do I do? Obviously no more park time until she learns to come to me when she has something I want, but how do I go about this? She’s good at fetch when we are alone, shes good when there is just one other dog and they take turns with keep away.

How much should I be feeding?,"So I've had my boy (aussie mix) for about three weeks now. When he was last weighed he was 57lbs and the shelter told me to feed him 2 cups of food a day. 

After his first vet visit I was told he is underweight and I should be feeding him 4 cups a day. He is a verryyyy lazy dog and while he does get walked usually 3 times a day for about 10-15 minutes each walk, he really isn't much more active than that. He's a big couch potato, so I'm concerned this food amount will end up being too much.

Looking to get a dog for My father for Christmas (He has requested one and Mother is okay with it.),"Edit: Since people seem to be confused about this. This is for getting information on breeds and maybe even breeders in my area. This is NOT about having the dog itself for Christmas.  
  
**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* He used to breed Dobbermans. We had a few mutts while I was growing up but none in the last 20 years

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Slightly favoring a breeder at this point but i don't have much knowledge on the issue.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* He lives on the old family homestead. So we have plenty of area. However Mother wants the dog to go to work with him so that is a limiting factor. Its about a 30 minute drive each way. Just him and two other employees at the store. (He owns the business so no issues about the dog being there) So something that wont mind the travel 4 days out of the week.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I have been looking at Terriers and Corgis mostly. They seems like medium to low maintenance dogs while being excellent companions.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just general obedience

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* This is a difficult question as I'm not really sure. He has few hobbies, mostly working in his shop durring his off time. But he is getting older (72 now) and is being less able to do his hobbies. This is partly to address that.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* We are rural (Though expansion of the nearby city is making us increasingly suburb.) so no dog park.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'm not certain on this.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Probably Small size

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I would guess low on most of these.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Pretty important. The area has a lot of nearby woods

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Either is fine.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either is fine.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* He doesn't get many visitors often at home, but would have people constantly coming into the store.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I doubt it will run into many other dogs.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Not that I can think of off hand.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

About once or twice a week. Likely alone for a couple of hours. (Sunday church and Wednesday night service.)

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Mother wants the dog to be simple and easy to maintain as she does most of the housework. (Much to our complaints and offers to help) She often works on cakes putting many hours into each one. They are on high countertops so I don't think it would be much of an issue but I would have peace of mind if the dog wasn't interested in them. Dad rarely travels so it should be with him mostly.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* No

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Possibly? But not for years. I am looking to married and start a family but I'm not even dating at the moment.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Own the house. Not looking to move.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Statesville, NC. No laws against breeds
* What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
* Pretty moderate all told. 70-80 F in the summer few weeks probably in the 90s.  40s typically in the winter with some weeks lower.

Please give a newbie some advice on [breeds] that work well for a young family with kids and cats ,"\*\*Introduction\*\*



1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?



\* Essentially yes. Both my wife and I (both 30 years old) had dogs in the family growing up, but haven’t owned one ourselves. We both know very little about dogs and have never considered ourselves dog people, but are now seriously considering it, if we can find a breed that fits with our family well.



2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?



\* Reputable breeder.



3)	Describe your ideal dog.



\* The ideal dog would be great with kids (we have a 2yo, a 4yo, and a 6yo who is very eager to be the “primary caregiver”, something we hope she’ll grow into), and would be totally comfortable with a loud, boisterous house with lots of kids coming and going. We are also a foster family, so we have new kids staying with us for varying periods of time essentially all the time. If nothing else, the dog has to be great with kids and adaptable given our family situation. Beyond that, the ideal dog would be playful, as between me and my wife and the kids there will be no shortage of people around to play with the dog. Ideally the dog will not be insanely messy or gross, but I get that dogs are dogs. The dog will ideally not have a ton of separation anxiety since we do all have things going on with work, church, social stuff, etc. We’re home a lot, but the dog will have to be okay in the backyard for several hours at least three-four times per week.



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



\* I’m wide open here. The only thing is I don’t want a cat-sized dog. We already have two cats and I don’t want a third. Medium sized at smallest frankly. Beyond that, I’m all ears. I suppose I’m hesitant about border collies, only because that’s the type of dog we had several of growing up, and they were consistently not great with kids from my personal experience.



5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?



\* Nothing crazy. Essentially all the training would be just behavioral stuff or cute little “play dead, shake, roll over” type things.



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?



\* No



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?



\* I see no reason why we wouldn’t have at least an hour of dedicated time for training, plus a ton of unstructured time where the dog is just around for whatever is happening.



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  



\* We live in a great neighborhood for walking and do that a lot as is, and obviously the dog will be part of that. I bet a two mile walk every other day is reasonable.



9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?



\* I don’t know that I’m willing to pay a professional, and I don’t really want to do much. I know some will be required and that’s fine, but definitely not looking for a high maintenance dog.



\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*



10)	What size dog are you looking for?



\* medium-large. 



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



\* Shedding - can handle some but not much. Barking - I mean I’d rather it not bark all night but dogs bark and that’s a reality I’m fine with. Slobber — This I am least tolerant of. As little as possible ideally.





12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



\* This isn’t insanely important as we don’t envision ourselves becoming “take the dog everywhere” people.



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



\* For me and my wife — personal space. For our kids - snuggly as possible.



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?



\* I guess I don’t know. Probably middle of the road. We already have cats like I said, so some people pleasing wouldn’t hurt.



15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  



\* Like I said with the fostering thing, this dog would have to be totally great with new faces all the time. I’m not looking for a watchdog.



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?



\* This will ideally almost never be a problem. Like I said, we’re not dog park people and don’t even live close to one, and I don’t envision us taking the dog around publicly much.



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



\* I don’t think so.



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



\* We’re at the house a lot as our kids are homeschooled, but there are definitely days where we’re out and about. The dog will have to be okay outside in the back yard (decent sized and fenced in) for at least a few hours on regular basis.



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 



\* This will start being me and my wife teaching our oldest daughter to care for the dog, transitioning at some point to her being primary. Everybody is on board and excited for a dog though.



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



\* We have two cats, one male and one female. They’re both fairly young (2yo and not quite a year old) and are absolutely wonderful with kids. They’re almost like dogs in their temperament, as many people have pointed out.



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



\* Nearly every waking second this dog will be around kids.



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?



\* N/A



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?



\* East Texas. N/A



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?



\* Typical summer is very hot. High of 105F not uncommon. Typical winter pretty moderate. Average low in January probably like 38F and high like 55F.



\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*



25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.



As I’m typing this I feel like I’ve got a pretty narrow window of what would work with our fairly crazy house as is. Hopefully there’s a breed out there that would fit into our box. We’d need the dog to be exactly what we want it to be in many respects, but for the right dog our house would be loving and fun as hell, haha. 



26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

Trying to decide which ACA insurance plan makes the most sense for me - A cheaper HDHP that isn't HSA eligible or a more expensive one that is?,"I am a mix of part-time and self employed, and have been able to take advantage of the ACA for years. A couple years ago I got turned on to an HSA as really more of an investment tool, so for the last two years I've had a HDHP that was HSA eligible through Blue Cross Blue Shield and have been making small monthly contributions to it.

Unfortunately, for next year there is literally only one HSA eligible plan, and it's not with BCBS but with Aetna. I don't like the idea of switching to a different provider, but it appears I don't have a choice if I want to keep contributing to my HSA. Here are things by the numbers:

My alloted tax credit is $434.

The price of a HDHP with BSBS is $351 per month with $7000 deductible.

The price of the HSA eligible Aetna plan is $428.57 with $5695 deductible.

I contribute roughly $60-$80 a month to my HSA. I have about $1200 in it currently and if I get it to $2000 I can invest it.

My tax credit would cover either plan, but I like to still pay a handful of dollars out of pocket. So by sticking to BCBS I could save close to $100 each month that I would get back as a refundable tax credit, versus like $100 for the whole year.

My question is, would it make more financial sense to stick with BCBS for next year and just not worry about my HSA? Should I dump enough money into my HSA to get it over $2000 before the year is out so it can be invested?",0,1732136388.0
My roommates dogs are scared of me and becoming aggressive. ,"My roommate moved in a year ago with his 2 dogs. 
One dog is startled easily. 
I am a very loud person with everything I do. 
It took them a few months to get use to me but then everything was fine. They would come to me with no issues. I would bath them. Brush them. Feed them etc. 
The one who is startled easily started shying away from me when the owner wasn’t home and wouldn’t come inside with me. Then the other one followed. Now they won’t come anywhere near me or even come inside when I’m home without my roommate. 
When I feed them they won’t eat until I’m back inside. 
They stare at me and watch me all the time. Lately they have started becoming aggressive towards me when he is not home. 
When my roommate is home they will come near me sometimes. 
I’ve tried giving them treats but they won’t take anything from me or come near me. 
I am feeling uncomfortable around them when he is not home.

How should I pay off my credit card? ,"I (21F) opened my first credit card last year. I started with a credit score of about 670. Now it is 628. I have no idea what I am doing wrong. I have about 1600 to pay off. I paid 600 last month and then my credit score dropped. My credit limit is 2000 per month. Each month I pay at least the minimum (usually I pay way more than the minimum). When I was only paying the minimum, my score actually increased by a few points. Do I pay off the balance in full? I have the money to pay all of it but whenever I pay off about 300-700 in a month, my score actually drops. 

I spend a lot and there have been times when I've reached my credit card limit but I'm pretty good about paying off the card. The first few months when I forgot to pay even the minimum and was hardly using the card, my score barely changed. I am confused why it is dropping so much when I do pay off the card.

"Feeling frustrated about what my friends consider ""good dogs""","I have a 4-year-old Siberian Husky who, while not everyone's ideal dog, is the perfect fit for me. Today, I was out with friends and casually mentioned how proud I am of how well-trained he is. My friends, who don't really know him (we live in different areas and meet in the middle), scoffed. I explained that he’s been through advanced obedience training, even earning his Canine Good Citizen (CGC) certification. However, because he's a Husky, he doesn’t listen to just anyone—you have to earn his respect, unlike some breeds that are intrinsically motivated to please humans.

Their response was a sarcastic “So he’s not really trained, then.” I found this frustrating, especially because I see his independence as a feature, not a flaw. To me, training isn’t about erasing a dog’s personality or suppressing their natural instincts just to make them perfectly compliant. I don’t expect my Husky to behave like a Golden Retriever, as they’re wired differently. In fact, I value his independent thinking and how he clearly expresses his boundaries. It’s a trait I respect, even if it might come across as “stubbornness” to others.

While it’s not a huge deal, I find it frustrating that many people, including my friends, define a “good dog” solely as one that’s perfectly obedient, even at the cost of their comfort and natural personality. To me, the goal of training isn’t to make him submissive but to build mutual understanding and respect.

Curious what the community would recommend here. Thanks!,"    **Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * No, I owned a dog growing up and have owned two dogs as an adult. One of these was raised from a puppy.

    * I would like a dog that is good with kids, won't kill our cats, is a good companion for the family, easier to train, medium to larger size dog, intelligent, and can handle longer walks. My ideal dog would not be aggressive/reactive towards guests or children as we have lots of activity in our home. 
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * I have been doing research into the following breeds: German Shepherd, Bernese Mountain Dog, Border Collie, Labrador Retriever, Eurasier, Greyhound, and Golden Retriever. I really love the idea of a German Shepherd but worry about them being too protective for our environment. Also love the Bernese Mountain Dog but have concerns about their lifespans.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Walk with a loose leash, obey basic and intermediate commands, play gently with kids, be good with guests and strangers, interact with other dogs in healthy ways (on walks or at dog park), and be a companion to the family.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * No and none.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * Honestly whatever it takes. We work from home and have an awesome teenager, so can devote substantial time to training and playing from multiple family members.
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * Trail walking (not hiking) anywhere from 30-120 minutes a day. Also play in the yard. Open to going to dog parks, but haven't done so before.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * Yes, willing to do grooming. The only thing I don't want is to deal with a lot of drool/slobber.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Medium to large.
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * Moderate to high shedding, low to moderate barking, and zero to low slobber.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * Not important.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Either is fine. We don't need a dog to be a cuddler and understand dog signals enough to respect personal space and boundaries.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * Probably closer to eager to please from a training and companionship perspective. However, I don't mind a dog that is confident and comfortable doing its own thing.
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * I would like a dog to alert me to people knocking at the door but to follow my cues on how to proceed. I would like the dog to greet strangers and visitors either warmly or with minimal interest. We have kids coming in and out of the house frequently and our dog MUST not pose a danger to them.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * Yes. We don't have other dogs and don't plan on more than one.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * Aggression towards children and people is the deal-breaker. We can work with most anything else. Unmanageable prey drive would also be hard (we have cats) although we could figure out how to keep the animals separate.
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * Very rarely. We work from home and I am a homebody already. I'd ideally have the dog with me in my office when not walking/exercising/training.
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * Our preferences are aligned. The only concern is we have a younger child so need a dog that will be safe with kids.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * We have three cats. I would like to adopt a cat-friendly dog or a puppy so we can socialize them. We also have a bunny in the home, but she is kept in her enclosure with door closed at all times.
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * Yes.
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * No.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * Denver, Colorado. There are pit bull restrictions here, but I am not sure of any other laws.
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * Summer can hit 100 degrees F and winter can go below zero, though these are rarer. More common that we are between 10-40F in winter and 65-90F in summer.

I ended up making a lot more money than anticipated as a self employed photographer this year and I’m extremely nervous for tax season,"Hi!!!

I’m a wedding photographer and I sell courses online for other photographers as well. As the title said, I planned on making around $150,000 this year and hit $232,000 before expenses. This seems awesome but my original accountant I learned wasn’t doing the best job and kinda screwed me over on underpaying my quarterly’s and not adjusting when I told her I was making more than anticipated. 

I got a new accountant  because of this and some other unprofessional behavior from my first one, and he is suggesting I submit a late s corp election for 2024 to save a little bit on taxes, and since I’ve honestly been operating similarly to one for years. 

I have paid $20k so far in federal and state taxes, and I guess my question is how much would I owe will I owe in taxes (a rough estimate obviously!) I am an extremely money anxious person and I didn’t grow up in a family making a lot, so I just feel completely lost. I have a lot saved for taxes, I’m just so scared it’s not going to be enough. I have another appointment with my accountant coming up so I can’t ask him all these questions then, but I just need help easing my anxiety until then because it’s all I can’t think about and it’s becoming all consuming for me if I’m being honest. 

For context my expenses are totaling around $65,000 for the year and I live in Arizona. I’ve paid $18,000 so far in taxes. 

Could anyone give me an idea of what I would owe still in total (self employment, federal, state) if I filed as an LLC, and if I filed as an s corp? I know getting the s corp back filed for the year isn’t guaranteed so I’m just trying to prepare myself especially with the holidays coming up. I’m anticipating around $30k but I don’t know if that’s accurate at all. 

I’m also planning a wedding for next year and I’m the main bread winner by a lot so I’m just freaking out a bit, so I’m sorry if I sound nervous!!! Thank you so much in advance. ",0,1731952908.0

Dog Destroys Kids’ Things,"I rescued a dog as a puppy a year ago and she seems to have a bit of separation anxiety. I tried to avoid it by leaving her as a puppy to go places but I didn’t seem to completely avoid it unfortunately. 

I know all the rules: Don’t make a big deal when leaving and returning, frozen peanut butter Kong, I give her exercise before and after coming home most days. 

She’s a little over a year old now and I tried to leave her out of her kennel because I feel bad leaving her there, but it failed miserably. That said, she only seemed to target my kid’s things well and her own toys. This has always been the case that she has never destroyed anything except my kid’s stuff. And even then it was never much, except this time when left alone. 

I know this is a form of separation anxiety, despite my best intentions, but I’m wondering if there’s a reason she’s targeted my kid that could maybe help at least curb that behavior?


Important things: 

-My kid is 6 and I think she considers them a peers.

-I don’t really have an area in my house that she can be that is “dog proof.” I wish I did.

-She’s a mixed breed, but seems like a herding dog of some type and has a TON of enrichment things, including a herding ball. 

-We have a nice-sized fenced in backyard, but I can’t leave a doggy door open because she likes to try to eat random things back there.

-In the past, she has destroyed things in her kennel with her also, so I only leave her with a Kong and no padding. 

EDITED TO ADD: I should have made it clear that I obviously know she’s going back in the crate. That’s not my question. My specific question is about if anyone has seen where a dog only targets one person’s items.",1,1728583627.0

Virtual Account Numbers for Debit cards???,"I do most of my online shopping using a Citi Virtual Account Number to protect against financial theft in case my credit card information gets compromised, such as in a data breach or by a rogue employee.

However, I’ve noticed that this practice causes my credit score to fluctuate, as the credit bureaus observe my credit card debt increasing and then decreasing frequently.

I’m hesitant to use my debit card for online shopping because of the higher risk and fewer protections if it were to be compromised.

FSA/HRA to HSA transition and questions about timing of when I need to spend by.,"So I'm currently on a PPO and I have an FSA + a company-provided HRA. Starting Jan 1, I am switching to a high-deductible plan with an HSA.

How to manage my 40 000$,"Hi everyone,

Why I am asking: I think the ~4% APY rates right now are pretty good and I would like to ""lock that in"" for future investments too. I wish the APY would automatically re-invest at that same 4% rate over all the next 30 years, but I guess it doesn't work that way.

I want this dog to love my wife,"We just adopted a 4- to 5-month-old terrier pup following the passing of her soul dog if 13 years.

She works from home 2 days a week, where as I am home every day. My job is less demanding, so I'm usually the one moving through the house, letting dogs out, giving treats, etc.

Breed recommendations ,"
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I have fostered dogs since leaving home and have grown up with dogs my whole life. I currently have a rescue chihuahua I adopted as well. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* Reputable breeder due to rescues restricting renters being able to adopt, as well as restrictions on the dogs becoming assistance dogs. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I’m looking into an assistance dog prospect, however that is not a must. If they aren’t suited to work then I won’t force them to work. Ideally a calm and neutral dog when out, but still playful and loving. I don’t mind a good old hike, and would love to have a dog whos just as happy to rot on the sofa for a few hours as they are to do the occasional hike in the Peak District during the summer. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I grew up with German Shepherds and Cane Corsos, so I’m very much looking for a larger more robust dog. I have a few health issues that mean too much intensive exercise will cause me to faint or go into cardiac arrest (not very fun) and occasionally have absent seizures. I haven’t had any tonic clonic seizures in years but I’m not too keen on smaller dogs in case i fall on them or trip on them. I love animals in general and I like qualities as opposed to breed. I love dogs who are very owner oriented, but can be tolerant of others. I don’t need a social butterfly of a dog, they don’t have to love everything and everyone they meet. 


5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Scent detection, dpt, psychiatric SD work, crowd control and targeted barking. Agility and advanced obedience (IGP or similar) can also be a good way of blowing off steam. If the dog starts showing interest/skill in an area, i will do my best to accommodate that. If they love playing tug and releasing the toy when told? Bite work could be introduced. They like parkouring off furniture? Agility. I’m happy with training the dog in front of me as long as they’re happy and fulfilled. I’m close to a trainer who specialises in service dog training and can do public access tests with her. 

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I don’t have any experience personally, but I have tagged along and would absolutely love to train as if we were competing, but not enter any competitions if you get my point. In terms of working, ideally an assistance dog for cardiac alert/ptsd. I have been through some national organisations however they didn’t have any available services. I’m also unfortunate enough to need a multi-purpose SD. They don’t want the dogs learning to do dpt as a cardiac alert dog apparently 🙄

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Im disabled and work from home, so being completely realistic around 10 or so hours as I do have to concentrate on my art without the distraction, and to sleep/make food and eat.

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* We don’t have dog parks as such in the UK but I live in the countryside on a tiny road. Closest shop is a 45 minute walk away one way, so 60 minutes of walking a day minimum as the closest village is 30 minutes away. There are no livestock fields so off lead walks with me and another few dogs realistically. If I move the area I would be moving to is similar, Northants for the UK peeps. As long as I can take regular breaks to sit down I’ll be fine. I won’t be able to go running/cycling with them but a long walk is completely fine. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I currently do my mums dogs grooming, as well as my rescue chihuahuas. I don’t mind going to a professional grooming salon either, if required. I don’t mind doing a trim, ear clean or nail clip and have grooming equipment. 

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Ideally large to giant (20kg+) I can lift 45kgs comfortably (mastiff foster was scared of stairs so spent a few months carrying him up the stairs) 

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Slobber and shedding: clothes can be washed and raked. 
Barking: as long as its not husky levels I personally dont mind. For my neighbours I would say nothing unreasonable, normal amount if not a bit more. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important as most dogs in the UK are off lead on walks. As long as you aren’t on a road you can have your dog off lead (if they aren’t an XL bully) 

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I would prefer a snuggly dog but they all need some quiet time alone. Mostly because I would need an owner oriented dog for SD work. 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Same as above, however they may have to make their own decisions when working, such as when my heart goes funky, they’ll need to learn to alert at different levels and intervals without prompting. 

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Im not HOH or deaf but my hearing is atrocious. I would absolutely be fine with a few barks. Nonstop barking and jumping is an absolute no, but a couple deep boofs is a ok. With strangers, neutral/unbothered or tolerant. I don’t really want someone to come up to me and try and pet my dog, or talk to me, but if they do i need them to just sit/stand/lie there and ignore the other people. 

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Maybe. My fosters/current dog have mostly been dog aggressive and I worked with the rescue and trainers, however I can’t have an SD who is aggressive, and would have to wash them. 

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression, simply because I have a dog currently, and due to the requirements for ADs/SDs. 

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 2-4 hours max a day for cooking/the weekly shop. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My housemates don’t care as long as nothing is damaged ie carpets and skirting boards. No involvement other than a few pets here and there. As long as they aren’t a JRT or another small breed. Monty is enough apparently. 

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Currently have an 8 month old male chihuahua, my housemate has a 5 year old bulldog called Henry. 


21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not too regularly but often enough to be something to work on in training 

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Yes however in the UK there are laws preventing bias towards dog breeds, my current landlord doesn’t care and I have written permission, and as long as you don’t have more than 2 dogs in Council housing you’re allowed any breed. 

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I like in the UK so Pitties and XL bullies are banned (unfortunately, I do love bully breeds) 

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* For summer its typically 15-26 degrees celsius and winter is normally 5-15. It really depends our weather is all over the place. 

25)	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I have helped my friend train her current assistance dog, and am doing a course on canine behaviour and training. I’m open to any breeds that can potentially be trained as an assistance/service dog as the vast majority in the UK are owner trained, as psychiatric SDs for adults aren’t catered for

Heloc - signed closing documents ,"So to make a long story short, I have some debt and also need home repairs. The carpets are lifting, there’s exposed nails in the floors, and I have a toddler that walks around all day. 

I’m the sole provider at the moment, and my finance is a SAHM. Currently with the economy today, and with just my income alone, we are staying afloat paycheck to paycheck. But we also need some home repairs and she thought it was a good idea to look into refinancing and that’s when I ran across Helocs as an option only because my rate currently is at 3% and don’t want to lose it. I obviously did some research before reaching out to the lender. It sounded good at first.  Yes, I know it’s a bad idea to consolidate debt with more debt. I knew it. But the pressures of my wife on me about it, and the constant stress, so I jumped and signed the docs WHILE at work. Literally less than 24 hours lol.

Please help. German shepherd adopt vs breeder ,"My family has had GSDs our entire lives. Our last dog was a GSD/Malinois mix that we rescued and was just an extremely difficult dog. I feel bad saying this but if he was with any other family I believe that 99% would have taken him to the pound or to be euthanized. 

He was the smartest dog we ever had but extremely aggressive since he was only 9 weeks old. We did everything right but I think it was just a temperament issue since he was probably some backyard bred dog + the combo of GSD/Malinois makes for extremely nervy, vigilant, and reactive. 

We’ve also fostered other GSDs, all of which have been amazing dogs but also came with some issues, although not as bad as our dog. 

My parents are looking to get another dog—GSD, obviously but we are honestly all a little traumatized with our last dog even though we love him so much. 

You cannot believe the amount of training, money, and sacrifice on our end to help him have a good life. 

I know that a lot of rescue dogs are the absolute sweetest (I actually just rescued a 12 week old puppy that’s a literal angel) but I cannot deny that genetics play a very big role in temperament. GSDs are especially tricky because they can be prone to “bad” behavior if they’re poorly bred. 

It breaks our hearts because we’ve always rescued and fostered but I am out the house now and it will just be my mom and dad. They are equipped to take care of a high maintenance breed like GSDs but not to the level our old one was. 

 We are just looking for advice and what to do. Money is not a problem. 

I know there are definitely good GSDs out there we can adopt but I think we’re just a little wary after our last dog. Any thoughts/advice? ",1,1726771616.0

Blog about Breed Recommendation ,"Last post here about these guys, but I read this article I enjoyed and wanted to share with Reddit (again, not sponsored). https://doghealthessentials.com/2024/10/24/dog-breed-compatibility-matching-pets-to-your-home/ ",1,1729818956.0
Dog dilemma ,"I’m going to Uni in a year, currently I live with my parents in a small and hot country where it’s very humid. So to not over exert my dog we always walk her in the morning or late night when the sun is gone. We live in a condo in a quite large apartment where can dog can roam around freely and we bring her down every 4hours to pee. 

Here’s the dilemma since I’m going to Uni, I want to bring my dog along to give her a sense of a world where it’s cold and changing weather, along with large plains in the country side since there’s no country side in my country. I’ve looked at a few Uni where they accept dogs in their facilities but the rooms, I feel is too small for my dog. There’s barely space for her cage, bed, food, water, and her. 
I’ve looked for shared houses but so far only found 1 where they accept dogs. 

Another thing is that if I do bring my dog along, it’s stop travelling for me as there would be no one that could take care of her for free and bills ( I plan on working) would take all the money I have. 

So I was wondering if I should take her along and continue my search for houses and ways to bring my dog along, or if I should leave her with my parents. ",1,1731627975.0
Working nightshift with a puppy?,"So I work nights (12am-8am) at a water treatment plant, with a rotating schedule. Every other weekend I work 12hr shifts, either 12am-12pm or vice versa. Basically one week I work 9 days in a row with two 12s on the weekend then have five days off, the next rotation I work 7 days then have 3 days off and work Thursday/Friday with the weekend off, then I work 7 days in a row and work monday/Wednesday with the rest of the week off, And the cycle repeats.

Anyways, I want to get a miniature pinscher puppy in a month and a half when he is 12 weeks old. I also live on the ground floor of a two bed one bath apartment with a patio door that leads directly outside. I crave the companionship of a dog and I know I can make it work, even if it's hard at first. My concern is working night's, and maintaining a happy healthy dog.

How often is it acceptable to take your dog out with you on group days out? ,"I have a relative who owns a small dog and she takes the dog out with her almost every time on a group day out. I like the dog and like having it around. But I sense that sometimes it can be too much for others in the group. The main reason is that when we eat out we usually have to find a place that is dog friendly, which limits us. It’s also not the ideal season to be dining outside. The days out are typically walks around town in urban areas. So what is the etiquette regarding pet dogs on days out? Okay to bring every time? Or is it expected to leave at home or with a dog sitter?",1,1729783901.0

Denied for $9k Auto Loan Due to 'Insufficient Credit History' Despite 68% Down Payment and 704 Score - Need Strategy,"TL;DR: Need urgent guidance - denied for $9k auto loan despite $17k down payment, 704 credit score, and stable income. Rental car costs mounting ($50/day).

**Financial Overview:**

* Income: $43k salary (1.5 years at current job, expected raise to $53-55k)
* Credit: 704 (Vantage 3.0), 11 months history, perfect payment record
* Down Payment: $17k ready (68% of vehicle price)
* Loan Needed: Only $9k
* Monthly Income/Expenses:
   * Take-home: \~$2,800/month
   * Rent: $1,100 → $550 (December with roommate)
   * Utilities: $200 → $100 (December)
   * 403(b): Contributing 6% with 50% employer match
* Emergency Fund: $3,600
* Savings: $6,000
* Retirement: $4,745 in 403(b)
* HSA: $400 (building to investment minimum)

**Vehicle Details:**

* 2022 Toyota RAV4 XLE AWD
* Price: \~$25,000
* Mileage: \~50,000
* Clean title, single owner, no accidents

**Situation:**

* Total loss accident two weeks ago
* Currently paying $50/day for rental (ends Tuesday)
* Denied by Capital One and Lightstream (account length, lack of recent credit repayment ???, and insufficient credit history)
* Only have one credit card ($600 limit) with perfect payment history
* Need solution ASAP to avoid extended rental costs

So... Which lenders are more friendly to thin credit files? Should I consider cheaper vehicles given the denials? Are there specific steps I can take to quickly build credit? What should I do?

Dog peed once in daughters room after she moved out,"We've had a 2 yr. Old rescue dog for 2 months now. Up until this point he's had no accidents and he's been left alone for 5-6 hours at a time.  Wonderful in the house when we're gone. I completely trusted him.  He reliably lets us know when he has to go out.  My daughter who he absolutely adores moved out a couple weeks ago and I just found a pee stain on her area rug in her bedroom.   Most of her stuff and boxes from her moving are all over the room. It was dry so it could have been there a week or so.  The door is closed now but I'm still bummed about it.  There is a little separation anxiety with him, so I questioned that but he's not done it anywhere else.

What Breed Should I Get Questionarre ,"[Meta] Breed Questionnaire, updated June 2016

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I'd prefer shelter/rescue, but not adverse to breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Small (not teacup) to medium (I live upstairs and have a fear of falling down the stairs if the dog is too big and yanks me). It will need to deal well with other animals and children. Intelligent, likes to cuddle, not a frequent barker, easily trainable, short to medium hair. Not high energy. Average lifespan of at least 10 years. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Some sort of terrier or a King Charles Spaniel (a family member has one so somewhat familar with the breed) seems to be popping up again and again in other dog breed quizzes, so I guess those? I'm not interested in dogs like pugs who have breathing problems as part of their breed creation. I don't really have any particular preference, breed wise. I'm more concerned about size and temperament.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Fetch, stop, lay down, wait, signal needs to go to the bathroom. Basically, don't have a crazy unruly dog running around.

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No.

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I'm home full time.

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

30-60, plus indoor play. I hadn't really thought of what sorts of exercise. Just indoor play of different varieties to get any extra energy out. I'd take them to a dog park occasionally.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

A couple of times a week would be fine. I'd like to try grooming at home first and if that doesn't work then I'll do professional.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Small or medium.

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Not a lot of shedding, not a yippy dog, and minimum slobber. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

I'd keep them on a leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

More of a snuggler.

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

More eager to please, but independent as well.

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Wary but not aggressive to knocking, welcoming to strangers/visitors.

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Yippy and aggressive are the only things I can think of.

At most 20 hours out of the whole week.

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

I live alone.

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I plan on getting a kitten/cat within a year of getting the dog. 


21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I rent. 50lbs max. No aggressive breeds.

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in Houston. Potentially some aggressive breeds, but not sure.

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

It's between 75-100 the majority of the year (spring/summer/fall), not including humidity. Winter is only 1-2 months and usually goes into the 30's for the low. Houston weather is bipolar, so even in winter it'll be in the 40's one day and 70's the next.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25)	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

"Just how intuitive are dogs,  anyway?","I’ve had my rescue dog Athena for 2 years (she is 4). She is my first dog, and we are very attached to each other. She is very human-centric in general.

Like many dogs, she responds differently to different people - for example, she’s more naturally trusting of new females than new males. A lot of dogs have things like that. 

But she also seems to “sense” my deeper feelings about individual people that should, on the surface, seem the same to her. Sort of like how your 7-year-old just “knows” which sister is your favorite, despite you being quite sure you’ve never talked about that. 

Have other people experienced this? In your opinion, is it possible that my dog (or all dogs) are that intuitive? Can their reactions - which sometimes seem unpredictable on the surface - tell us more about our own minds?

Or am I just high?

Well, I guess it’s not really an either/or.

[Breeds] What dog should my boyfriend and I get?,"** Hey! Just some background: I work as an RN, so 3 12-hour days per week. I live with my boyfriend, who works from home. We live in a 1200 sqft house that has a decent size yard. It's pretty warm in the summer and we have very mild winters. We're thinking of getting our first dog together and have been trying to find a breed that we both like. Thanks in advance :) **

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I grew up with Bernese/Pyrenees mixes, and worked with my parents to train them. My boyfriend grew up with many different dogs but was never involved in training.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We'd prefer a breeder - we're considering kids at some point in the future, and while I fully understand that amazing, gentle, and family-friendly dogs can be rescued, it would give me some peace of mind to know exactly what breed we have and what health requirements they need, which can be hard if adopting a mixed dog.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

* We both would like a dog that is somewhat low-energy, gentle, and easy to train. We'd like a dog that's generally family- and animal-friendly (we have a very chill, older cat). We'd like a dog we can take on hikes and bring camping, but will also cuddle with us on the couch at night.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I've always gravitated to large dogs. I really love Bernese. I grew up with them, and I loved their goofy, cuddly personalities. I'm also interested in Retrievers, Aussies (which I know are high energy so maybe aren't a great fit), and potentially doodle mixes (which I know is a hot topic, my mom's sheepadoodle is just so cute and smart). My boyfriend also likes large dogs, and has been interested in German Shepherds and labs.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The basics, mostly. I'd really love a breed that can be well leash trained, and can be trained not to jump on people. We trained one of our Bernese mixes to throw away beer cans (which was hilarious and awesome), so maybe a few dumb tricks like that too.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Nah. Our goal is a family dog.

**Care Commitments**

 7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work 3 12-hour days per week, and my boyfriend works from home. We have quite a bit of time to commit to training, socializing, and interacting with our dog. But we would like a dog that's easy-ish to train and isn't too stubborn.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

* At least an hour per day, if not more on days I'm off. We have a decent backyard that we could play fetch in. We go on walks around our neighborhood pretty often, and hike a few times a month. Neither of us are runners or bikers, so we wouldn't be going on super fast-paced walks. We have dog parks in our area that we could go to for socialization. My mom and sister each have a dog (sheepadoodle and heeler) that our dog would probably see frequently. That being said, we don't want a super high energy dog - my sister's blue heeler is a little too much for us.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We’re totally okay with brushing often. Growing up with Bernese, I got used to the hair and grooming responsibilities. My boyfriend seems more into shorter haired dogs, but I really love how soft the longer haired dogs are. We have a robot vacuum that does a lot of work around our house, and we don't have much carpet so fur is easy to clean. I don't mind trimming nails or cleaning ears, it doesn't gross me out. If we have a breed that needs to see a groomer regularly, we could definitely make that work.

**Personal Preferences**

10)What size dog are you looking for?

* We both like larger dogs, at least 50lbs, but bigger is fine.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* We don't mind shedding much. I know that shedding comes with most longer-haired breeds, especially since we live in a warmer climate. We both know that Huskies are a little too chatty for us, so maybe moderate barking is okay? It would be perfect if they'd bark a few times if someone came to the door, but didn't continue yapping for a while after the person comes inside/leaves.  And I don't mind a little slobber (thanks to the Bernese), but my boyfriend isn't as chill with slobber as I am.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Decently important. We like to go camping and hiking, so it would be nice if we could bring our dog and they could be a) trusted to not bolt and come back when called and b) not terrorize other people or animals in the area.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* DEFINITELY snuggly :)

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More eager to please, since we're hoping for a family dog that's easy-ish to train.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

* We'd like a dog that barks a few times to alert us that someone is here, but generally is kind and gentle to strangers. We don't need a guard dog, just one that alerts us when some is here, and maybe has a big enough bark to scare off any intruder.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* We would really prefer a dog that is friendly with other animals, especially since we have a cat and will see my families' dogs often. We plan on socializing our dog, and hopefully we can avoid aggression.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Spastic, constant barking for no reason and aggression towards people (especially ones they've met before).

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not often. My boyfriend works from home, and I'm lucky if he leaves the house to run to the store more than a few times a week. We do go out to dinner and have date-days from time to time, but we're both homebodies so our dog wouldn't be alone much. We do travel occasionally (usually weekends away or short trips to see his family), but my mom is happy to watch any dog we get so that her sheepadoodle has someone to play with. On a typical week, the dog would be alone for maybe a couple hours at time once every few days for dinners or doctor's appointments. There is a small chance my boyfriend transitions back into the office, but since I only work 3 days a week, we could arrange our schedules so the dog isn’t alone often. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My boyfriend plans on being pretty involved, but I think I'm more of the dog-person between the two of us.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a very chill, geriatric cat. He's lived with dogs before and as long as our dog isn't constantly chasing him (we know the puppy phase will be a little rough), the cat probably won't care.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not regularly, but children are a maybe in our future, so we'd like a breed that is generally child-friendly and patient.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Nope.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in Socal, so no rules or regulations regarding breeds. We live in a very dog friendly area, so we see dogs at breweries, patio restaurants, the beach... and would love a dog that could join us on those adventures too :)

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* It gets pretty warm in the summer here (usually 90s in the day). Our house has AC, but summertime would likely limit activities to early morning or evening. The rest of the year is very mild (even winter is like 50s during the day, 40s at night).

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I know doodle mixes are a hot topic, and I don't know much about them, so if you have any thoughts (positive or negative), I'd be happy to learn more. My mom LOVES her sheepadoodle, and I have a coworker with a Bernedoodle and he's honestly such a good dog. But I know there are some issues with doodle mixes and the ethics of breeding them, and I'd love to learn more and make an informed and responsible choice. We’d also like to know more about the grooming and the shedding fur vs. non-shedding “hair” if anyone has any thoughts. 

We would love a snuggly, goofy, easy-to-train large dog. We'd like to bring them hiking and camping, to breweries, and to hang out with our families' dogs, so trainable, sociable, and friendly are our priorities. I also just really love cuddly, goofy dogs, so I'd prefer a breed with that type of personality and temperament. My boyfriend keeps emphasizing a low-energy dog (I think my sister’s blue heeler scarred him for life). I would be happy with a low- to mid-energy dog, especially since I’d love a buddy to walk and adventure with on days when my boyfriend is working and I’m not. 

We also know that getting a specific breed doesn't guarantee a personality type or temperament and that a lot can depend on the environment and training, but would love to know y'all's thoughts on breeds that could be a potential match for what we're looking for and our lifestyle.

Thanks so much in advance, I appreciate all the thoughts and opinions :)

Should I sell my car ,"Hi everyone, I hope some people could give their opinions on my current situation.

I currently have a BMW 2021 330i with 40k miles that I owe 24.5k on. I want to sell the car because the car payments are $600 and the insurance is $170. I have an offer from caravana for 23k so I have 1.5k of negative equity.

I’m a recent graduate and I work in accounting and make 87k a yr (5k net a month) but hate these car payments. I live with family and im able to borrow/ use their car (they are old so they don’t drive) for the time being until I save to buy another car. These car payments are aren’t allowing me save because im paying down all my debt. I now only owe 2k on cc excluding the car loan. Paid off all my student loans!!!

I think that best course of action would be to del the car and save for another car and buy outright next time. Let me know your guy’s thoughts. Thanks.

Gas Shut off (Colorado),"So my family of 5 just had our gas shut off. We got the notice on the door around 6 p.m. and assumed it was a scam. There's a lot of scams that we are aware of that have gone around with people being told their gas is going to be shut off. 

I sent the notice to our property manager. July 2023 they switched our utilities from directly paying them to paying through a separate automatic billing utility processor. We were told we wouldn't need to call or set up any of our utilities with the new payment company. We have made all of our payments on time. We set up auto pay as soon as they told us to enroll and we did. 

For starters, I wasn't sure they could shut off our utilities in the cold months. As far as I understand, Colorado has a cold weather rule that prevents your primary heating source being shut off in the winter. Secondly, we are a medicaid family, meaning we qualify as lower income. 

The notice says we owe $868. Do we have any recourse?",0,1732267551.0
Am I wrong in this situation? (dog park interaction),"I know that dog parks are a controversial subject. While they pose safety risks to owners, children, and other dogs, it seems there are a few ways to combat potentially negative interactions at dog parks (besides not going). Unfortunately I had a bad experience today and would appreciate some insight. I am a first time dog owner, so please be kind with your responses.

My dog is a 5yo male chihuahua/rat terrier mix. He has fear based tendencies toward other dogs, most notably correcting them if they run up to him too fast or spook him from behind. He might nip at the other dog in that case, but he has never attacked or bitten another dog. This is because he was attacked by an off-leash dog in a local neighborhood several years ago while he was on leash. He's mostly okay around other dogs, he just prefers not to be around them. If someone brings their dog into the same off-leash space, my dog will ignore them until we leave the space as fast as we can. Please note that I never let him off-leash on walks or at a park unless we are the only ones using the gated space. 

Today, I took him to a park that has three gated areas for mixed size dogs. Two small dogs were in one, a few large breeds in the other, and none in the third. I brought my dog in and let him run for all of about two minutes before someone showed up with their golden retriever. At this point I am across the space from the gate picking up his poop when I see the guy approaching the gate to the same space. I kindly shouted ""My dog is not the friendliest, so we will leave and let you have the space. I just need to get over there to put his leash on real quick."" He says ""okay"" and proceeds to release his dog off-leash. I guess I thought maybe he would wait for us to leave before entering to avoid conflict? As I'm approaching the gate, he says ""so what's your problem? your dog isn't friendly?"" to which I said ""not most of the time, unfortunately"" and  led my dog away while holding onto his harness. My dog is not showing any interest in his while this interaction takes place as he is pretty familiar with the protocol. Dogs = leave. I was a little bit offended by his tone, but figured he was an old man who doesn't understand what it's like to have a slightly reactive dog. I understand that dog parks are designed for friendlier dogs, but the way he released his dog anyway after my warning felt a bit entitled. This could've been avoided if I were closer to the gate and could've taken mine out before they even came in so as to ""give"" them the space. That's what I would've preferred to do, but I had a hand full of poop, lol.

As we are walking out, I see a young couple with their puppy approaching the gates. The woman chimes in ""I always thought it was common courtesy that if you know your dog isn't friendly you don't let them in there."" I was taken back by this a little bit, because to me I had done everything in my knowledge to successfully avoid conflict between any dogs. I let the guy know BEFORE he let his dog enter, I promptly guided my dog out of the space, and chose to walk him around the park instead. Plus, we were in there for all of two minutes, not like we were somehow hogging the space. I saw an opportunity for my dog to roam free and took it, and then responded accordingly when that was no longer possible. Am I wrong? 

I guess I feel a bit discouraged. Not everyone's dog can be raised from puppyhood to have a perfect, social personality. My dog is not an immediate threat to anyone elses unless he is approached in a way that freaks him out. He's okay with a brief greeting, but other than that he just wants to be left alone. It's not fair for him to only be allowed to walk on leash for the rest of his life as we sadly do not have a backyard. 

My dog is a rescue and I am just trying to make sure he gets good exercise while having consideration for others who have dogs better suited for socialization. I didn't ask the guy to use a different space, but instead let my pup have his two minutes of ""freedom"" before leaving. I always try to find spaces where there are no other dogs running around, as opposed to other owners who let their reactive dogs attack and potentially hurt others (I don't think mine would ever do this, but that is why I try to avoid it even being possible if I can). Sure, I could take him to the park at 6am when no one else is around, but there will always be the possibility of interactions like this. 

Am I wrong for bringing my dog to the park? I feel really guilty for even taking him.. but he deserves it as much as social dogs do, too. He didn't do anything wrong. I wish there were dog parks with smaller gated spaces for one person/dog to occupy at a time. That would avoid so much risk! 

I appreciate any advice from others who might've had similar encounters. Unfortunately I haven't found any places to take him off-leash nearby where there won't be other dogs. Training in my area costs $3000+ which simply isn't possible for us. Besides, I don't think a dog correcting another one is inherently wrong, but it's embarrassing and not appropriate to other owners, hence why I try to avoid it.

Changing tax withholding during holidays,"Curious what others think of this strategy, which I haven't seen people talking about. At the beginning of the year, my wife and I (filing jointly) have our federal withholdings set to give us a \~$4K refund. I know it's an interest free loan for the gov't, but taking less home forces us to be better with our budget and we like getting a nice check every spring.

This year, with four paychecks left, we decided to reduce withholdings to increase our take home pay for the holidays. If my math is right we'll still end up with at least a $1K refund, and the extra cash at this time of year is helpful. We'll reset them in January like usual.

Financial decision mistake buying a car,"Hi everyone hoping I can get some advice. I believe I may have made a financial mistake with buying a car unfortunately. I was previously driving a Volkswagen and I live where it can snow quite a bit so I originally should’ve bought an SUV or AWD to begin with but that’s how it worked out. So this weekend I decided to purchase a Subaru Outback. The car was $28,000. However I have $5,000 in negative equity with the VW and decided to just roll it over, which I am now regretting. With the new purchase including vehicle tax, negative equity, warranties, GAP insurance, plus dealership fees I am looking at $38,000 and a minimum $600 payment with financing. I can afford to pay $850 per month plus put a $1,200 payment per year but nonetheless I have severe buyers remorse. 😭 Can anyone offer advice?

Looking for a Small/Medium Breed,"1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It will be my first dog in my young-adult life, and the first one I would be the primary caretaker for. I have grown up with a pit-pull lab mix, then a pit-pull miniature schnauzer. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Due to my situation, I'd highly prefer going through a reputable breeder so I can have a better idea of the dog's temperament and energy levels from before they're even born. I don't want to risk getting a dog that'd be too much for me. But rescuing a dog is never completely off the table, I am always open to that.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

A medium to small eager to please dog that loves people and animals. A dog who enjoys doing sports and wants to be your best buddy. They're going to be by my side and have their crazy moments but be able to relax inside the house.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I lean more towards lean, energetic medium sized dog breeds. See a Border Collie, Lagotto Romagnolo, or a Toller(Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever). Recently I've looked a lot more into Border Collies and Mini Aussie's but am looking for other options with a less thick coat and less energy. I've lived with a Samoyed for a period of time and absolutely loved their temperament and friendlessness, but currently I live in a very hot climate and would not feel okay having them with their thick coat. If I didn't live in a hot climate, they'd be the top on my list. If there are any other dog breeds similar to them without the heavy coat I'd love to know. The schnauzer breeds are ones I've looked into and am curious about the standard schnauzer if anyone has experiences with that!

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic obedience, crate training, then I'd like to train them to different dog sports. Specifically, heelwork and obedience training.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

I'd love to do heelwork/dog dancing, obedience, and literally try all the different sports with a dog. Find which sport they love most and let them have fun with it! If that's scent work, agility, or dog diving I don't mind. I'd really just want to find something that they love to do and do it with them. I have zero experience with any dog sport, so it'll be a big learning experience for the both of us.

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1-3 hours would be my personal goal for them.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

I plan on spending at least 1-2 hours a day. I'd like to go into a dog sport, long runs, and going hiking 1-2 times a month. This time does include dog parks, which I'd only go to a few times a month.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am good with daily brushing, and all listed above. I'd take them to professional as needed!

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium breed. Nothing more than 50lbs for me.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Slobber and shedding don't bother me. I can handle a minimal amount of barking, for example- alert barking a few times when someone walks by. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It's very important to me that they can be trained to have a strong and consistent recall

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I'd like a more snuggly dog, one that lies by you or likes to sleep in bed.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

A more eager-to-please dog is preferred.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I'd like for my dog to be alert and have very minimal barking, none if possible.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I will manage an aggressive dog if it comes down to it, but I'd highly like to do everything I can to avoid this outcome.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I'd like to avoid more stubborn and reserved traits with humans and other animals. Any breed that has a thick fur coat that would struggle to be out in hot temperatures (see Samoyed's and Keeshond's).

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Anywhere from 5 hours to 8 hours a day.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

That the dog will not be a large breed and helping to take care of basic necessities.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

2 cats, and I don't plan to have any more pets.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

A few days a week.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

N/A

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I am not aware of any laws banning breeds where I live in FL.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Around 90f on average during the summer, then only down to 60f in the Winter.

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I don't plan to get a dog for at least another year at minimum. As I mentioned in question 4, I am looking for options of other breeds that have less energy than Mini Aussie's or Border Collie's that are still under 50lbs. But the dog will still love doing a sport and be easily trainable, then preferably not stubborn! If anyone else reading this does have an Australian Shepherd (Mini or Standard) in a warmer environment similar to my temperature, how do they do in that warmer environment?",1,1729546579.0
Is it worth refinancing a car from 7.24% to 6.49%?,"2024 SUV with 34400K left to pay; 72 month period. Met a guy who works for a credit union who said he could get me down to 6.49. Is it worth refinancing? They also offered 65 months at 5.99.

Update: More context:  
  
I have always done 72 months on all prior loans to lock in the lower payment and just accelerated the payments with each bonus I received at my employer but hearing other peoples opinions is always welcomed and appreciated. The original loan at start, 8.11% in Jun'24 with one provider and switched to a Credit Union in Oct'24 at 7.24%.  Missed lower dealer captive promotions by a few months. No cost for refile as new application/approval with Credit Union expires first week of Dec. Credit score: 723. Now I am deciding to refinance with current Credit Union based on this offer which close to their base line refinance rates (listed below) or wait until the Fed rate is reduced again in Dec. I just don't know if this Fed bet is close to the expiration of the current application or after.

"Should I, ironically, actualize gains to offset my current stocks losses for the year?","I currently have a closed out trade I sold earlier this year, which was a long-term hold, that has me at -$7000 approx for the year.

I know that $3,000 of this, max, can be used to offset general income as a loss, with the remains indefinitely carried into next year, and future years if that situation presents itself.

I have some large paper gains on NVDA, all long-term holds, and I was curious if the smartest move is to sell some of this now to cover either $7,000 in gains, presuming that then I would not be taxed capital gains taxes on said NVDA sale, or at least $4,000 in gains, leaving me with $3,000 in loss for the year. With earnings tomorrow, and the year’s end coming up, I thought If it could benefit me in this way to trim the position now, it might make sense.

Would the $7,000 actualized loss from the previous long-term hold benefit me more during tax filing than offsetting that loss with NVDA gains to avoid paying future capital gains taxes on NVDA sales? Would this process irrelevant since I’d have at least $3,000 in losses to work with next year from carryover?

Ameriprise financial a reasonable advising company? ,"I recently received a little over 1 million through some unexpected esop transactions at the company I work for. This is way more that I have ever expected to manage at 29yo but I want to have it left somewhere to let it healthily grow until my wife and I decide to retire (which now might be early than originally planned)

ith this much money it's hard to know who to trust. My Edward Jones advisor was practically drooling when I mentioned it to them and want everything right away. So I was referred to an Ameriprise private wealth advisor who is a friend of a friend of my in-law. 

They seemed pretty good at the first half of the meeting, mentioning their bank has higher FDIC insurance and talked to their CPA about what tax impacts this windfall will have plus their 5k annual fees. But then the next came all the insurance pitches and 529s for our kids etc. (reading some other posts this seems to be pretty common)

So as of right now they opened an account that now has a majority of the funds transferred, and they've scheduled another meeting for the next steps and to see if we want to continue to use them (we haven't paid or signed anything yet expect to open the account)

How do you get over grief?,"Hello everyone! How do you get over grief over your dog, especially when he hasn't died yet?

For the last week, his health has been declining rapidly, he is very tired all the time, cannot stand for more than a few minutes and we went to the vet to see what's happening, where the doctors found the prostate cancer and a very severe anemia. They hospitalised him daily from 10:00 to 18:00 to have some transfusions made but he is not getting better and i have been advised that it is time for the injection.
I'm crying non stop, i cannot comprehend him dying, he is my best friend, my angel, my sweet little heart, i cannot accept he is leaving me. Don't get me wrong, i will do the injection for the sake of him this weekend so he doesnt suffer anymore, but i cannot believe this is happening to this poor little baby.
If my state is like this now, before him dying, i dont want to know how it will be after him passing away.

So please, how did you people get over the grief, or at least this big griefing stage, without forgetting your little angel?

"carrying a chew around and trying to hide/bury it, is he having fun?","sorry for the strangely worded title, tough coming up with something concise! We noticed that when we give our 2 y.o. herding breed mix an especially appreciated chew he gets really excited to accept it. Maybe 10% of the time he'll go right to work and chew it up. 

The other 90% of the time he will carry it from place to place in the house looking IMO kind of stressed out, hiding it in a pile of laundry, then behind some books on a shelf, etc, etc, each only for a few seconds and then picks it up again and keeps carrying it around. These times he never chews on it at all, just carries it around seeming to be looking for the right hiding/storage spot. He looks driven, like he's on a mission. 

I can't tell if this is stressful for him, or is he's enjoying this whole activity, or what is going on? He gets lots of other stimulation (stuffed kongs etc) so I can just eliminate giving him this type of chew if it's more upsetting than fun.

My dog- a tiny Jack Russell Terrier - has been invaluable in keeping me from stepping on live wires and other hazards. She does her snake alert- stops, stares, and starts pulling me backwards as hard as she can if I try to continue.


Today she just walked us both across a downed - dead, or, well- we'd be dead- wire. I didn't see it until it tripped me.

My question is this: is it normal for dogs to be able to differentiate between live wires and dead ones?

Negative consequences for slowly paying off credit card debt via multiple 0% interest balance transfer accounts? ,"I currently hold $5,500 of credit card debt in a promotional 0% APR credit account. The 0% APR is set to expire in October of 2025. It's within my monthly budget to pay off the debt by the time this promotional APR expires.

Alternatively I could lesser monthly payments and use the excess money to fully max out my Roth IRA contributions and put the rest in my high yield savings account which is earning \~4.25 interest. If I were to take this route my plan is to make another balance transfer to a new 0% APR account once my current promotional APR expires.

Are there negative consequences to this plan? I have opened 2 balance transfer accounts over the last few years and haven't noticed a negative consequence to my credit score. There are opening fees with balance transfers accounts and I haven't fully crunched the numbers but I think those fees would be less than interest earned by maxing out my savings.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",0,1732479147.0
How can we maximize maternity leave benefits?,"
Wife is currently 10 week pregnant with twins. Definetely planning on quitting after babies are born. Fortunately she was able to work remotely with coming into the office once every 2-3 weeks. Recently she's been getting some pushback from her boss that she needs to start coming into the office once a week minimum.

We recently moved to get some family support, so her commute is ~2.5 hour in the morning and ~3.5 hour after work. It's really not possible to continue this especially we are having twins. 

Is there any way we can benefit from maternity leave benefits? Can she possibly take early maternity leave at around 20-25 weeks, take partial pay, and quit once babies are born? Trying to maximize our current situation since it will probably be better for her to be stay home mom vs continue working.

"trying to rebuild after two injuries killed my career and my savings., and nearly killed me.  ","sorry, this is long. 

hey folks. I could use some help. I'm already beaten down into the dirt, if you could refrain from insulting me, I'd appreciate it.  I'm in pretty bad shape financially. doing my best to claw my way out of it. 

I'm 46. I started out as an art professor, but the pay ($32k in nyc), stress, and job stability was so bad that I moved into doing project management and 3D design for cabinetry, millwork, furniture, and interior design, mostly for high end flagship retail stores. Made about $85k/yr living in NYC. At the time, I was an active alcoholic with severe untreated lifetime depression, so I didn't manage my money well. **I'm now 7 years sober** and working with a good therapist, things are much better but my finances are worse, due to the fact that....

during the pandemic, after being laid off for a year by covid, I got severely injured riding a bicycle. Broke 8 bones, collapsed a lung, had a brain hemorrhage, had 3 surgeries, was on oxygen for 3 months, etc. Took a year to recover enough to go back to work. 

A year after that, I had a traumatic brain injury skiing. The TBI severely affected my vision and brain function, and I am no longer able to work as a project manager or designer, or many other things. I was out of work for almost two years and then initially could only work part time. A couple years later and after spending thousands and thousands of dollars (my entire savings), on treatment for the TBI that wasn't covered by insurance (meaning basically all of it), and after numerous false starts with trying to go back to my old career and various other jobs, I finally have a full time year round job that I can do, working as a maintenance manager for a Property Owners Association. 

fwiw, the brain injury makes decision making very difficult, especially when i'm stressed, which is why i'm here. 

so here's my current situation: 

* 46 yrs old. single, no kids, one small dog. $500 in savings, $1k emergency fund, no retirement, literally no family left except my mom who is 72 and has no savings or retirement besides the $600k house she inherited. 
* Live in a remote mountain town of 2k people. COL is somewhat expensive, but my AA sponsor is here, my therapist is here ($30 a session, basically pro bono), my job is here, all my sober friends are here, etc. I have to go to another town 30 minutes away about once a week for healthcare, groceries, walmart, etc. Moving somewhere cheaper would cost me several thousand and my pay would drop by half. I like it here and would prefer to live here permanently. 
* make $34/hr, about $70k a year, will get a stipend for health insurance, 3 weeks PTO, 10 holidays, IRA with 3% match. flexible schedule. I live 6 minutes from work. 
* starting a second job teaching skiing on weekends at $20/hr in a couple weeks. there is a chance that it will be too much with the TBI and I'll have to quit and focus on my main job. I also live about 5 minutes from this job. 
* Rent is $1250 a month for a 1bedroom during winter. In the summers, I live in a camper on a friends land and pay no rent. 
* groceries are about $400/month. I'm already mostly eating rice and beans, cheap eggs, cheap bulk frozen turkey burgers, and oatmeal, so it would be hard to get this cheaper. I maybe eat out once a month, usually at McDonalds using a deal on the app. 
* car insurance is $200/mo. I shopped around a lot and this is as low as I can get it. I've never had an accident, but I got three speeding tickets last year while visiting my mom on the east coast, just wasn't used to there being cops everywhere. This will get lower next year when my tickets fall off. 
* about $70/wk on gas.
* phone is Mint, it's $50/mo. 
* have a 2020 F150 that is financed. has 100k on it. I've paid about $17k on it so far, currently owe about $16k. 11% interest. payment is $435 a mo. I do need 4x4 and high clearance where I live as it snows a lot and they dont plow much, most of the roads are dirt/mud in summer, etc. I also do haul stuff several times a week for work. I'm trying to sell this but it's difficult because no one wants to deal with paying off the loan and waiting for the title, and I've mostly gotten lowball offers. I would ideally like to get rid of it and get a 90s truck I can work on myself (yes, I actually can, i used to be a mechanic). 
* I recently inherited a 2005 dodge diesel truck that doesn't run. It's prob worth about $15k running, but I need to put about $1k-$1500 into it to get it working again. I'm considering selling the ford and keeping this since I know the truck inside out and how to fix it, and i dont want to deal with someone else's used truck with god knows what problems, but also diesels are a pain and expensive. 
* have three maxed out credit cards due to being out of work and all the medical bills. I paid these off every month before I got injured but now it's out of control. 1 @ $6000, 1 @ $800, 1 @ $3500. 
* $90k in student loans at 6%. in deferment currently. 
* dont have anything else I can sell, except for a bunch of tools in storage that's worth maybe $3k, hesistant to sell these as they are potentially a source for additional income next summer, as I'm a skilled carpenter and those are in demand here at about $35/hr. Not something I can do full time, but part time for additional income is an option. 

Ideally, I'd like to get rid of all my debt and buy a small piece of land and build myself a small house so I never have to move again, but I realize that's a long way off. 

I think that's it. Greatly appreciate any help.

Help with dog who poops inside on an almost nightly basis,"We have two good boys at home, one GSD mix and a Great Dane / Lab mix. The lab mix is the problem child as of lately. We let our dogs out in a large fenced in area of the backyard and I get them to the off-leash dog park a few times a week. Lately I’ve been taking them on longer evening walks in an attempt to mitigate the serial pooper. 

The Great Dane Lab mix routinely poops in the house at night with no signal that he wants to go out. On our late night walks he refuses to poop and when I let them out in the evenings (they are outside for at least 45-60 min every evening before bed) it appears that he is also not pooping. We’ve tried adjusting his feeding schedule to give him his dinner meal at around 4 pm and that doesn’t seem to make much difference either. 

In the past he has had an issue with eating his poop when he poops inside, that has seemed to stop for the most part. 

I love this dog but he is driving me nuts with this issue. He’s always been prone to accidents in the house but lately it has become a regular occurrence. Any insights or ideas are greatly appreciated, I can feel that my anxiety around this issue is having an effect on him as well and that breaks my heart.

    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * Biddable, smart, joyful, velcro-y, and confident.  I would like a dog with good handler focus, stable temperment, with moderate food and toy drive.  Mediumish, though size is somewhat flexible.  I'd prefer a breed that doesn't require regular professional grooming. I'd like medium energy at least, with the ability to have rest days too. 
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * English cocker spaniels, Welsh springer spaniels, and smooth collies, but would love to hear other suggestions of breeds to look into

    * I'm interested in dog sports including conformation
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

When to drop friends over my dogs..,"Curious what boundaries you all draw with your friends/dogs, and when you would drop a friend over violating those boundaries.

I've previously banned a friend from my house for generally antagonizing one of my dogs (pulling on her tail, patting her relatively hard on the head repeatedly, etc.). She is extremely tolerant and allowed my friend's behavior, but that does not mean she needs to be constantly subjected to it, especially by a full grown adult. I politely asked him to stop; he did not, so he is no longer welcome at my place.

Recently, another friend, whom I've trusted to care for my dogs in the past, came over and riled my dog up so much that she jumped up and accidentally scratched him on the hand. He plays with her a lot, which I don't mind, but now he won't stop bringing up this scratch and acting like somehow my dog is out of control.

I can't decide if this new scenario is enough to ban this friend from seeing my dogs, but I'm leaning towards yes. We literally worked in canine behavior together, so I feel like there's no excuse for him to be blaming this on my dog.",1,1730741172.0
Pet Hair Repellent Clothing,"Alright... I have 2 dogs that shed when you look at them. There is nothing that stops it.

IRA to HSA Transfer - Advice Needed,"Here's the situation...

* Actively enrolled in CDHP and maxing out HSA contribution for 2024(family coverage). Planned to continue this in 2025.
* Actively enrolled in Charles Schwab 401k, contributing 6% to meet employer match.
* Sitting on a $9k traditional IRA with Betterment. I have not been contributing for more than a year because I don't qualify for tax deduction due to income limit. For context, this was funded by an old employer 401k.

With one Qualified HSA Funding Distribution allowed per lifetime, I am considering the following for **2025**...

* Transfer $8,550 (2025 HSA contribution limit) from the IRA to the HSA in January. This would meet my limit for the year, but in turn not allow me to contribute pre-tax dollars from my income for the rest of the year. At the same time, it would be a tax-free funding. 
* Increase my 401k contribution to make up the difference (if not more) of what I would have been contributing to my HSA to keep my taxable income lower.
* Rollover the remaining IRA balance to Charles Schwab 401k (if possible, I need to confirm).

Bear with me... I'm still a novice when it comes to investing. At the end of the day, I’d like to consolidate my Betterment account into another existing account while minimizing tax implications.

Food Recommendations for Dogs With No Teeth,"Hi everyone!

I have a senior miniature Dachshund who has no teeth. I was wondering if anyone has any good food suggestions? 

The vet said just to feed her normal kibble, and that her cat without teeth eats dry food just fine. However, I’ve noticed she isn’t a fan of plain kibble. From observing her it seems like she’ll eat it if she HAS to almost. 

I started to mix some of her normal kibble with some wet dog food called Cesar and she LOVES it. Does anyone know if Cesar is a good brand? I’ve noticed wet dog food is pretty pricey so I chose Cesar a bit for the price point, but I definitely don’t want to give it to her if it’s not a good brand. 

Another question would be if feeding her chicken and rice would be okay. That’s another thing she eats joyously and the vet says that’s a food that’s soft on the stomach.

    26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

My partner and I have been considering getting a dog, but it's so hard to choose. The dog must be knee-high or taller (my partner's condition) and fairly fluffy. Can you advise what do tou think about the below options?

Our first option is a Newfoundland, a breed my partner knows well as his parents had one when he was a teenager. However, I'm worried about the size—it's too big for train rides to visit my parents (and I go about one weekend a month), and it won't fit in their small car. Either my partner will have to stay home with the dog, or I'll need to buy a bigger car, which is daunting since I'm just learning to drive, and don't have a car at all yet.

I'm also concerned about the fur and drool, as we live in an apartment without a garden or space for the dog to swim. The costs for XXL size supplies, food, and vet care could be high, and I'm unsure how we'd handle emergencies (what if the dog get hurt or sick? How to carry it to the vet?). Despite these concerns, I’m still considering it because of its great temperament and how much my partner wants one.

The second breed we're looking at is a Eurasier. But since it's a primitive breed and I'm inexperienced, I worry it might be hard to manage. I'd also prefer a more cuddly, easygoing dog. I like that they are fairly quiet and their look.

Lastly, there's the rough collie, a breed I love. But I’m concerned about the grooming demands and that they tend to bark a lot, which I dislike (also I don't want my neighbours to hate me LOL). Plus, as a herding breed, I'm unsure how much exercise and time they would need daily. Me and my partner are quite couch potatoes and both work 8hrs a day and we don't want the remining hours to be spent on the dog only. Of course the dog will have walks and play everyday no matter the breed!

We mostly seek a companionship at house and to go on walks. We aren't looking for a dog to train agility with etc.

My Dog's Toy Was Discontinued. Looking For Alternatives,"EDIT/UPDATE
Thank you all! I've tried a few of your suggestions. Apparently this is a US problem as they seem available in other countries. I contacted the manufacturer and got a very nice reply, but they dont have any to sell me and are not going to start manufacturing them.

Hello All,

** NOT Kong. I've tried it and it's too heavy for her**

My Doberman has one love in this world and it's the Petstages Orka Treat Dispensing Tire. I went to order another one and was horrified to find that it has been discontinued. I can't over state that this toy is my dog's whole world. Nothing else exists if the tire is around. Not sure what I'll do when the most recent one ""dies""

I have looked high and low and cannot find a decent replacement/comparable product. Any recommendations would be appreciated. I honestly thought about starting a petition to see if I can get the company to start manufacturing them again.

I read all the rules and I think this post should be okay, apologies if I'm in the wrong there.",1,1730589409.0
Is a phone payment good for credit?,"My apologies if this is a dumb question, I'm very new to all of this and I've never taken out a loan of any kind.

I'm planning to buy a Google Pixel 8 or 9 with a $240 trade-in rebate. The total cost would come out to $715.19, but I'm being offered a $26.53 36-month payment plan. 

Even if I have the money to buy the phone outright, would choosing the payment plan and simply paying that sum over time be wise from a credit standpoint? I figured if I'm going to buy the phone anyway, and I have the cash, I might as well take the payment plan if it's beneficial, since it wouldn't be any extra work and it's a purchase I'd make regardless.

Is there anything I'm missing? Will this hurt my credit score?",0,1731660634.0

Balancing pay down mortgage vs financing a car,"My wife and I just sold our old house and finally have a decent chunk of cash. We were hoping to refinance the mortgage on our new home, but rates went back up to what they were when we bought (just over 7%) so refinancing isn't an option right now. We can take the proceeds from the sale of our old house and pay down some of the new principal (using something called a recast), reducing our monthly payment, but we'd be keeping the 7.1% interest rate.

We are also in the market for a new car. We can easily buy the car we want with cash, that would just leave less to pay down the principal on our mortgage. We could finance the car through the dealership (2.9% up to 36 months, 3.9% up to 60 months, 4.9% for 72 months). I understand that generally you want to pay down higher interest debt first. So should we just put down the minimum on the car and pay off as much of the mortgage principal as we can? Could someone help me with a formula so I can plug in the numbers to compare scenarios where we pay off more of the mortgage vs down payment on the car to try to optimize?

We already have an adequate emergency fund and are maxing out our retirement contributions, so those don't need to factor into the question.",0,1731679477.0

What's a good portfolio to build after rolling old 401ks into IRAs?,"Finally deciding to stop being lazy and roll over my old employer 401ks into IRAs so I can do more than just change investment distributions around. I have roughly $150k to roll into an IRA and $255k to roll into a Roth IRA and both I plan on leaving for 20ish years. I also have roughly $150k in individual stocks in a taxable account (hooray Covid shopping spree I guess) that I’ll be changing around but I think planning the IRAs first is the best way forward.

Since I currently live overseas as a US expat, I’ll be talking with a tax advisor soon to go over the finer tax details but assuming everything works out I’m kind of curious how I should invest those funds. I lean on the riskier side but I’m not trying to gamble my life retirement away. I was thinking VTI / VOO (or maybe even just VT) as a base then some sprinkling of growth, dividends and REITs. Could even see myself taking the same diversification percentages for both but taking opposite ETFs (ex: SCHG in one but VGT in another).

My Schnauzer died unexpectedly this weekend. I'm just devastated,"Miss Stella was the gentlest dog I've ever known. People who met her used to say how she seemed timid and standoffish, but I always knew she was only being polite just before absolutely & unapologetically smothering complete strangers in love & cuddles. Without fail, she'd be flopped across her new friend's lap in 10 mins or less, licking their fingers and demanding a tummy rub or 3.

Over the weekend, we were having a quiet night at home. I left the living room for 30 mins or so to make dinner and when I returned I found that she had gotten into a bag of beef jerky that I thought I had left out of reach. She had swallowed a moisture pack whole and choked with her head still in the bag. I still have no idea how long she was lying there before I found her.

I can't stop playing that scene thru my head now: digging the plastic out of her mouth, trying over and over to revive her with CPR, scream crying on the phone with my mom while i held her... I can't shake this guilty feeling that I both caused this and couldn't save her. I feel even more horrible for my younger Schnauzer, Daisy, who's always had her friend around but is now sitting all alone at home as i type this at work.

behavior training tips plz plz,"

Hello, everyone! 

Seeking some stories of experience or advice for my new one year old rescue dog named Mi Cha she’s a mixed breed but thinking a staffordshire bull terrier. I got her around a week ago and all that I know of her history is that she was a stray and was picked up by a mom with a son high on the spectrum who would frequently “be loud” with the dog. She seems to find them with noises unless she’s in a state of fear for example, if she sees one of my roommates and start growling, and then we go to my bedroom. Then she’s alert about any sound probably for the next 15 minutes. Today I’m going to call and ask for her surrender forms. She loves my one roommate, but growls at the others. I want to save up to get her into training. This is a problem. The shelter said she does best meeting people in open settings like outdoors. (My other two roommates not really trying to get her to meet strangers right now because it’s only been a week. I want to give it at least three weeks or three months.) she’s never lunged at anyone, she has ran up to one of the girls, but still sat away from her and just barked. When we’ve done two days in a row of them individually meeting outside my other roommate the dog loves, brings them out with her while I sit with her outside in hopes that would make her more comfortable. They greet her with excitement. I let them know that to act confident and they have treats. They’ve played fetch, but she’ll go back to barking eventually. It all kinda goes down the drain once we’re inside. I don’t know if it’s just because she’s still getting used to her own environment, at the vet she did just fine. My other roommates think it’s because they’re black, but… idk I don’t really think that’s a thing I could be so wrong though. I’m Asian the roommate who adopted her was white. Staff at the shelter was pretty diverse. On Mi Cha’s first day home when she was with my roommate, I left for a bit and one of them when she started barking, jumped on top of our counter, which I don’t think helps anything. The same roommate is afraid of the dog. I think she can sense that. I just don’t understand because in the shelter she did just fine with people. I took her for a walk yesterday at a people park but very early in the morning in hopes I wouldn’t see a lot of others. She barked at them and pulled towards them, but I held her without petting her, but had my back away from them facing her without making eye contact with her. When the people had finally passed a distance, she started whining, keeping an eye out for them, which I think just means she’s really afraid. Any advice would help I don’t really know if I knew what I was getting myself into because the shelter just noticed she seemed to be very fearful. Apparently, upon her intake, she was growling at everybody and then she did all right. I come on Reddit because I don’t know there’s a lot smarter people on this subject matter. She’s my first dog and she’s been doing really well potty training wise, she doesn’t seem to display aggression with food nor high value objects like her toys. 
I really don’t wanna surrender her and I probably just need to give it more time.  I just know extensive training is a lot more than I can afford as a college kid. It feels like I’m taking the right approaches. She’s not obviously just locked in my room for the day she rooms. Unless if I know my roommates need to go to the kitchen or something this isn’t fair to anyone though I think that’s more shameful about it. Any training advice again would help I feel like I’m going in circles at this point, but that’s the rundown.",1,1732130844.0

Student Loan Payoff vs Mortgage Down Payment Question,"Hello, 

I am trying to help my girlfriend figure out what to do with her finances to help alleviate some stress.  

She is a single mom of a special needs child and her coparent is significantly behind on child support with likely no hope of payment any time soon. 

She has a good salary of around $63k but her rent, legal, and living expenses are such that she is having to dip into savings each month even with virtually no personal spending or entertainment. 

She has been trying to find a new apartment or rental home but cannot find anything that will keep her in the black each month so she is exploring possibly buying a home instead of renting. 

She has approximately $148k in savings and we're trying to figure out if it would be better for her to pay off her student loan of $32k which would eliminate $460 in loan payments each month, or should she keep the loan and put as much as possible down on a house? 

She is very anxious about touching the money in savings since she is on her own with her kiddo and feels it will be very hard to gain any of that back in the future especially since she likely won't receive any child support. 

Additionally, because of kiddo's needs she needs to stay in a specific school district for around 4 years and we're trying to identify if buying now would be a bad idea since she might need to move to a better district if middle and high school. 

Any advice on how best to allocate her funds (or not touch at all?) would be greatly appreciated. 

Tldr Should my girlfriend buy a house possibly for  only 4 years due to staggering rent prices, and should she pay off her student loan to eliminate a large monthly expense even if that reduces her savings and potential house down payment? 

Thank you! ",0,1732472939.0

403(b) Not anywhere *near* where it should be,"I am 44, have been at my current job for 20 years, and have two 403(b)s. One I pay into and the other my employer matches into.

I just found out that the one my employer pays into is sitting at $20,000. I find this highly concerning given that I've paid that much into it.

EDIT #2: I got ahold of the account manager and there are two things going on with this. First and foremost, apparently at some point in the past my employer was contributing significantly less to the account than they are now, so the money that's gone into the 403(b) is actually several thousand less than I thought. It's still performing poorly, but not nearly as poorly as I initially thought. The second thing is that 40% of the fund was in low-interest bonds.

Looking for advice in building credit from 662 after closing my only card,"I'm trying to learn about finance this year after years of neglecting myself.

I'm 27 years old and I have a 60k salary in NYC. Since I got my job in 2021, I burned through my money on restaurants, bars, travel, gifts, and entertainment and *never* saved. I didn't budget at all nor did I strategize what I used my credit card for. This summer, I had no savings, barely anything in my checking account, and around $6k of debt on my only credit card. It was a big wakeup call.

I spent the past few months paying off the card then I closed the card in fear of using it again It was a Capital One Quicksilver One card with an annual fee and a pretty high APR around 30%. I had it since 2021.

I now know it was a mistake to close the account - it lowered my credit score by 84 points (746 to 662). I was pretty motivated by the guilt and shame of my debt and didn't trust myself keeping the card open. I was also listening to my dad's advice, who said to close it immediately even though it would hurt my score. I know he didn't tell me it in bad faith and just didn't want me to keep using it irresponsibly. Today I have $0 in available credit and 0% credit usage. My other accounts are school loans that have been paid off. I can't take it back now and want to move forward and educate myself more.

This fall, I made a savings account, high yields savings account, and am contributing to the 401k plan my work provides. I'm already saving a bit in each account. It feels good to learn how to build stability for myself. I was just stopping myself from doing it before by staying uneducated and spending whenever I got paid.

Now that I started saving and know I'm capable of doing it, I want to work on rebuilding my credit so one day I can get a home loan, car loan, or whatever else. I feel intimidated with the options of credit cards. Does anyone have suggestions for a card to apply for so I can rebuild my credit score?",0,1732209991.0

Using Assets/Stocks in Taxable Brokeage for A Portfolio Line of Credit ,"It seems there are several names for what I am considering (margin loan, Asset-based loan, etc.).

I plan to use annual bonuses to pay back the loan earlier if makes sense financially. When would I be at risk of my assets being liquidated? Anything else important that I'm missing?

Looking for a fitting dog breed,"Hey guys my girlfriend and I are thinking of moving in together as soon as I’m back to working locally and we get our apartment, we’ve both always wanted our own dog. My girlfriend is obviously very interested in a dachshund as she’s seen a bunch of cute dachshunds on tiktok and instagram and I’ve got to say I love them too.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I’d prefer a reputable breeder to get a puppy as I don’t think I’d be able to take on a rescue especially if they have prior traumas as I don’t think I could help him the way he should be helped

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* A dog that barks little to never, doesn’t need too much exercise (40-60 min walk), isn’t too lonely if my girlfriend and I aren’t home as she studies and I work for 8 hours a day, little to no shedding or grooming necessary, and preferably no known hereditary health issues, Id love to take him on longer adventures especially hikes on the weekends though so preferably a dog that doesn’t overheat easily, and he’d have to be friendly and good with other dogs and people especially little kids as there’s babies planned for the future (woohoo)

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* The best match I’ve found with online quizzes is a Field Spaniel, and I love my Flatcoat but I’d prefer not getting the same dog again

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience, Strong recall, and a few simple tricks like roll over and so, but nothing too specific.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? Is so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Nope

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 10-20 minutes training and cuddles as often as possible

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 40-60 minute walks, I would also love a dog that could run with me but from personal experience with my family dog not every dog is all too excited to go on a boring run with no fun sniff and pee stops.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I’d prefer if a professional did it once or twice a year

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Any size as long as he’s not too tiny

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Little to no barking or shedding, although a little love slobber is fine

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Quite important for hikes

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Own thing as long as I can snuggle him every now and then and teach him some tricks

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Friendly and not too loud, maybe a bark or two of excitement as that’s always cute but I don’t need an extra alarm system 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Nope, he’s gonna be besties with my family flatcoat

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* There’s probably some but none so grievous that I could think of them right now

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Every weekday between 0730-1545 and maybe longer depending on the overtime (Military 👎)

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My girlfriend wants a doxie but she’d love any dog really. She’s also obviously very ready to care for it as well.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Nope I don’t but he’ll meet my family’s flatcoat once every two months or so

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not rn but hopefully babies in the future

How to Deal with FOMO and Regrets After Selling Investments?,"Hi everyone,

I’m struggling to deal with some intense feelings of FOMO and regret, and I’m hoping to get some advice or support from people who might have been in similar situations.

My wife and I are about to buy a house we’ve been dreaming about for years. It’s a huge milestone for us, and in January, I need to put down the money for the initial down payment. Most of my savings were in stocks (U.S. market + my local market). Back in June/July, when we signed the paperwork, my portfolio was up around +30%.

Then, in August, the market dropped, and I panicked. I ended up selling 70% of my portfolio, and recently, I sold the rest. Overall, I got out with around +20% gains, but if I had stayed in, I’d be sitting on +40% or more now.

I know I should be happy with the gains I made, and the fact that we’re achieving our dream of owning a home. But I can’t shake this overwhelming regret that I held on for so long, only to sell at what feels like the worst possible moments. I keep thinking about how much more money I could’ve had if I’d been more patient.

Now, I’m just sitting on cash, waiting for January.

How do I let go of these feelings and stop replaying these “what if” scenarios in my head? I know I made the decisions I thought were best at the time, but the FOMO is eating me alive.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you find peace with your decisions?

Thanks in advance for any advice or encouragement.

Opinions on tackling this debt,"Should i use a certain order to tackle these debts or maybe some two at a time? I am 28 and around 40k in debt. The goal is cutting my debt by atleast half , if not more by this time next year. I will have 10 months to really not spend on anything, bringing in around est. 2500-2800 a month. I have 4000 in my account right now. And my debts are as follows

I have no subscriptions and will be cutting my phone bill in the next few months.

My sons mother isnt in the picture. My student loans are 5 -6years old. So my question to you is:
What sequence and amount monthly would you tackle these debts in 10 months with around 2700 take home pay and having lodging and rations already taken care of with just having to buy a few necessities here and there. Also the $400 for my son, the car insurance .

What breed is my dog?,"I adopted a 5-6 month old puppy from a rescue last month. He was found on the street with his sisters in TJ and was taken in by a good samaritan before being transferred to an LA rescue. He is an absolute sweetheart with such a good temperament! We were originally told that he was a Maltese/Terrier mix, but now that we've had him for a while, I'm not so sure anymore. People have told us that he looks like a Coton de Tulear, and he does express a lot of the behavioral traits of one (standing on hind legs, etc.). His fur is also very soft and cotton-like, with the wiry Terrier texture down the middle of his back. We are certain he is part terrier due to his athleticism, beige coloring, and fur texture, but am interested in knowing the other parts. Any thoughts?

Lease a new car and sell old one?,"I have a 2020 Volvo XC90 with 30k miles. Car is paid off, but needs tires, brakes, fluid changes and next year spark plugs. This comes to about $5000. Property tax is $1000 for 2 more years. $6000 total over 2 years. Car is now out of warranty.

Carmax offered $31k for the car as is. 

I can lease a new one with free maintenance, for 2 years, $13,800 (total payments over 24 months, 7500 miles which is sufficient), inclusive of tax and fees.  This is the plug in hybrid so I get some fuel savings.

I am estimating about $8000 for the cost of the new lease over maintaining the old one. Factor in depreciation for the old one is probably $6-7000 over 2 years.  So maybe for $1-2k I am driving a new car with no unexpected repair cost.

Wilber Debt Group Debt Help,"Hello! I was wondering what would happen if I didn’t pay off my debt with the group in the title or just debt collections in general. A few months ago, I was in an at fault car accident and then insurance couldn’t pay it off so they sent it to debt collections. Now, the original standing charge was $6,993.87 and they gave a 20% discount to $5,595.10. The payment is due tomorrow and I got off the phone with them saying I can only do $3,500. But they keep insisting that I pay the rest next month or in monthly installments. I genuinely don’t think I can afford to pay the rest next month because I’m still borrowing money from other people and I have to pay them back and I also need a car to get a regular job. I’m a full time college student. They said because next month is tax month, people come into money and that could help pay it off. Even then, it’s not all my money to begin with and it’s other people and my parents and my brother helping me out. I’m not in a good financial position to pay all of that.

"First time in open enrollment, which health care plan is right for me?","I turned 26 earlier this year :( and had to get health insurance on my own for the first time. 

Background: I'm pretty healthy, I exercise every day, eat well, healthy body weight, no meds, etc. I only see the doctor maybe once or twice a year. Typically just a physical and maybe a random event, like I had food poisoning earlier this year for the first time. 

My employer offers 3 health plans and below are the options:

1. Low Deductible: $675 annual deductible, $5,500 OOP max, at $110 premium per bi-weekly paycheck

2. $1,800 annual deductible, $5,900 OOP max, at $85 premium per bi-weekly paycheck. 


    I chose this earlier this year, but because I'm no where near reaching the deductible, I've been paying for the appointments I've made in full, which is what I would have done with the HDHP, but I'm paying higher premiums out of my paycheck.

3. High Deductible with HSA $3,600 annual deductible, $6,000 OOP max, at $52 premium per bi-weekly paycheck. **Additionally, my employer would contribute $700 annually to my HSA**

I'm leaning towards the HSA because it has lower premiums and given that I only see an estimated $300-400 in uses next year for appointments, I could contribute to my HSA and also get the employer bonus as well.

I would like to hear from users here if they had similar traits on their dogs and if my perception of him being different is just my personal opinion.

But let me list a few things and i am looking forward to your responses:

- never played with any toys / ignored balls, sticks, etc.

- understood complex commands and understood situations (joined me at work at different clients)

- never barked or made any sounds (only when playing with other dogs)

- never took, damaged, chewed on anything

- was ultimately calm (even as a youngster), wasnt stressed by anything

- was very happy to meet dogs and humans, greeted everyone but immediately went on to do his stuff (sniffing)

- never needed a leash, not even in busy streets, etc.

How do I know when he needs a wee?,"Hello there,

I have the sweetest, most brilliant, adorable 8 month old F1 Labrottie/Rottador/Labrador Rottweiler cross (whatever you want to call it).

We got him at 8 weeks old in March. His 'house training' was effortless and seemingly instinctive. Apart from a handful of accidents, he has always gone outside with basically no direction from me. 

Since we got him the back door has pretty much been permanently open.... It's getting cold now though. The door is shut to keep the heat in and I'm worried that he doesn't know how to tell me he needs to go. What signs should I be looking for that he needs a wee (or poo, although that's more obvious).

I think he can hold it for a very long time (I've known him not to go for 10+ hours), but I'm worried that he might need a wee but doesn't know how to tell me. I'm not worried about him going in the house, I just want to make sure he isn't uncomfortable. 

I'm undoubtedly overthinking this but I'd still love to know what subtle queues there might be in a dog that has never not had access to the outside when I've been home. 

Thanks in advance.

Negative Car Loan. Is this a good plan?,"So I have a Jeep Wrangler 4xe. If you have been keeping up with Jeep you'd find they are tanking in value with all the issues and now a major battery recall that is telling owners to do not charge, do not park near structures or in garages for fear of fire with no fix in sight currently.

Thankfully mine has not had any issues recently, but it did receive the recall notice.

A couple months ago, I got a buy back estimate of 28k. Today, I received a buy back estimate from Carvana for 34k. I owe 46k. 

My plan was to pay double payments starting January to try and catch up to the value and trade in or sell. I did an amortization calculator and I estimated I would be to about 34k in 5-6months. What I fear is that if it's worth 34 now it will be low again in 6 months therefore not catching up. 

What if I sell for 34k now, get a loan for the remaining balance (12k) and those double payments amounts I planned to the loan and pay off the loan in 6 months and then buy a new car from scratch? Is this a better plan in your opinion?

I would have another vehicle to drive in the meantime and plus I work from home. 

It makes sense to me, but wanted to try and make sure I am making the right choice. You may ask why I just don't stick with the Jeep and make double payments - the ongoing fear of something major going wrong and also the possibility of getting a cheaper car payment later on a more reliable car is enticing.

How do you know if a dog is play biting?,"Hello,

I’ve got a new neighbour as of 2-3 weeks ago and they have a lovely dog. I didn’t grow up with animals and come from a home where everyone is scared of animals, so I had to train myself to let go of that fear. I’m fine with dogs and I have been fine with this dog so far. The owner leaves the dog with me for a few minutes from time to time and I have had no issues so far.

Around 40mins ago, the owner left the dog alone with me and I attempted to play fetch with the dog. The dog didn’t bring the stick back and decided to play with it on her own, so I supervised. I went to pick up my phone and she started jumping up and biting my arm and running around in circles. She jumped up on me and was biting my arm and running around in circles for 3-4 minutes. I remained calm and removed my mouth from her arm several times. After a few minutes, she’d latched onto my sleeve and wouldn’t let go, but the owner came back and she ran off, which is another reason I believe she was playing.

She did puncture my skin through my jacket and top and her eyes did look a bit crazy, but it’s only a few scratches. I just want confirmation that she was playing because I have a 3 year old that plays outside (with supervision, obviously) and the owner said that he is trying to train her to be more aggressive, which worries me. I’ve never owned a dog and I’m not the most familiar with dogs body language. I acknowledge that it’s my fault for not learning. 

She’s a good girl and I don’t blame her for anything, even if she wasn’t playing. If I’ve done anything wrong or could’ve done anything better, please let me know. She’s 11 months old for the record.

"Im 22, my house went into foreclosure, got reinstated, but credit score has dropped 200 points. Did I squander my headstart?","Hey guys, really need some help here, I had big plans and I think I screwed it all up because of one mistake.

  
I bought a house a 20 years old, I started building a second house on the property. About 7 months ago, my loan got sold to Freedom Mortgage, my loan had been sold several times before and I thought direct deposit information always transferred over. This time I didn't check, and with all the money I was spending on construction, I didn't notice that the money wasn't being withdrawn. I feel so stupid for not noticing but alas its done.

  
Over those 7 months my credit score fluctuated slightly, but only by a point or two. I know its not a totally accurate process so I thought this was normal. Then, in October it dropped 200 points. I immediately went and checked and found my loan was in ""active foreclosure"". I immediately called and got a reinstatement started, but it took around 3 weeks from beginning to end. Luckily I had almost exactly that much money saved up. November 12th my loan was fully reinstated, but my credit score is only around 552 now.

I have some friends that deal with mortgages, and they said I should call Freedom Mortgage and beg for forgiveness essentially. Ive made a few calls to their service department with varying levels of sympathy from the agent. Twice now theyve sent me to the escalation line, but then I end up on hold for 30 minutes straight and eventually the call gets dropped. I understand they might not be able to expunge the foreclosure, but even a letter from them explaining the situation could help

  
My goal was to buy a few more properties in my twenties and build some more houses, but with such an awful credit score it seems like I might have to let go of this hope.



I feel so stupid, I have never missed a payment before this, I had all the money in my bank account, and resolved the issue straight away when I found out about it, but it seems like Freedom isnt going to/able to help me get this resolved. Is my only hope to try and call the credit bureaus? Thats my next step but I feel like they will have even less understanding than Freedom.

Help with DIY nylabone healthy edibles bones recipe?,"I feel silly asking this, but my dog is a weirdo and it's costing me far too much money.

He's an older boy and he loves to chew, with the caveat that he doesn't like to chew on toys or actual bones. The plus side is he also does not want to chew on stuff he shouldn't either. But...

the only things he likes to chew on are:

Sticks (but must be small, almost a twig)

bully sticks

and nylabone healthy edibles bones

And the worst part is he chews them in minutes. He would eat a hundred a day.

I have him getting just one bully stick or nylabone per day, but even that is so expensive. The only other treats he likes (besides freeze dried chicken) are these Bark Bakery faux chocolate chips cookies that are also expensive. And I have tried EVERYTHING.

Has anyone tried to make their own version? I googled but can't find a recipe. The ingredient list doesn't seem crazy but any attempts I have done to make them doesn't result in the right crunchy texture. I don't want him eating actual sticks either.

I know a well bred dog is going to be expensive but would it be acceptable to ask the breeder on the price of their puppies when first contacting them if they don’t have that info available?

I’m the type of person that needs a clear goal when I set aside money for something, and also I would need to price compare to an extent.

Thanks for the advice! ",1,1726518146.0
"[RIP] Duke, Labrador","It's 2 am, and it's difficult to think about this and sleep at the same time. Even more when you feel kind of guilty 'bout it.

He was the second dog that my grandparents had since I was born in 2004. The first one, Bronco, accompanied me in lots of adventures that I vaguely remember, I was 6 yrs old when he died. Didn't go through something hard when this happened because I felt kind of shocked + didn't understand the fact that he wasn't by my side anymore. I know this is not a post about him, I know, but I loved him, and I hope he got his place up there and is resting peacefully.

This hit me hard. Specially when your family is a cold one in terms of emotions/feelings and they tell you this like if it was nothing and 1 week later after he passed.

A sunny day, a really beautiful day, you came to our lives, Duke. A little black soft dog, who appeared from the nothing to this special dimension. Those innocent eyes, would inject an instant emotion in me and whoever who got the good luck to know you. Brilliant eyes always asking indirectly to play, to run and to have a joyful and peaceful time by your side. 

Duke, my best friend and best companion. The one who would help me to leave behind my bad thoughts and feelings while we discovered new places around our grandparents village. Walking through the beautiful forests will feel lonelier without you. 

It's sad that I just had the chance to see you every two weekends, but that didn't mean that I didn't love you. Of course I did, and I hope you know it wherever you are. Now you are part from something big and natural, and we'll be sharing the same place sometime in the future.

You went trough a lot and I had to see everything that happened to you, every wound. Time passes, and as it does, you grow and change. And you did. 

He suffered wounds because of attacks from other dogs during the nights. He got injured from one leg, something that would get worse and worse as time passed.

You went from being a healthy dog to being totally injured. No one cared 'bout it, I really cared, my love I swear I cared.
I couldn't do anything to change your situation because I was just a teenager without money to do it. 

My parents and grandparents refused to help you baby, I had to watch you suffer every weekend. Reaching a point where we couldn't go for a walk anymore as a normal dog would. I swear I didn't leave you behind. 

The last months you couldn't walk, you just almost couldn't go to drink or eat, we had to take the food and the water to you.

I hope you people understand me and don't hate me because of this. Here in rural spaces is common to have a pet and not taking care that much. Just having it till it dies. I think they once called to a vet but just for one thing. They wouldn't do it, never again. 

Hope y'all could understand this situation. Been feeling really bad and guilty because I couldn't help my baby to be healthy. He lived through 13 years, and then his last 1 year and a half were a total hell for him, and I know it.

I feel really bad. I didn't deserve him, literally no one.

One year ago my little cousins, came from another country and had to take more care of them and playing with them when they'd come to my grandparents home. I also took care of Duke and tried to be with him as much as possible. 

When my cousins arrived Duke couldn't really walk already. I could only approach him and giving him love. Now I see all of this in perspective and can only think on his lost look in his eyes that he had everytime I would make eye contact with him.

Baby, I know you suffered, I loved you a lot, you can't imagine. Man, I can't believe he is not here anymore. And it feels so sad, saw no one feeling sad about it, no one cried. 

They all take this as something common, and feels so cold, and bad and sad. I don't feel like Im part of the family. I really can't feel it.

The last day I saw him he was in another part of the house, totally alone, and went to pet him and he looked sad and lost. He died days later :( .

My love, my baby, my beautiful dog. I hope you rest in peace and have a great time up there with Bronco. Play and enjoy and wait for me, please. I hope both don't hate me, I hope both love me. Im so sorry.

Im so so so so sorry. Really. I hope you understand it, I really loved you honey. I can't sleep thinking about the fact that I couldn't give you my last goodbye, my last kiss and hug. Im so sorry and I miss you. 

Rest in peace my love, my baby, my everything. 💔

Breed Suggestions,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
  
1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* No. We had three dogs growing up and I had a dog of my own when I first moved out. I've worked with dogs my entire life and specialize in dog behavior / training.  
  
2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* Either is fine but I'm most likely going to get a rescue.  
  
3)Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* A medium or large dog that has a mix of energy levels. I'd like to be able to go on walks with them but also chill around the house too.  
  
4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* I've always loved great pyrs. I feel like they would be a good fit for me.   
  
5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* Basic obedience stuff and maybe a few fun tricks.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* No.  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* I'm disabled and don't work so I have all the time I need. Realistically, it would be a few hours a day.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* We have a walking trail right next to our house that I plan on using for walks. Minimum walk is 30 minutes but can be a few hours.  
  
9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* I'm having to do a lot of brushing for my cat already so I wouldn't mind doing a daily brushing for the dog too. I do all of my own grooming and have done it for all of the dogs I've had in the past.  
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)What size dog are you looking for?  
  
\* Medium to large. I guess technically they might be considered extra large but nothing like a great dane or irish wolfhound.   
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* Ideally, shedding shouldn't be a problem, it doesn't really bother me. I don't mind a dog that barks, especially if people come to the door and such. I'm not a huge slobber fan but it's worth it for some dog love.  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* I don't really ever plan on having them off leash unless we go to my in-laws. They have a huge property out in the country. So... not really?  
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* Both but probably a more snuggly dog.  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  
  
\* Both to this too. They don't have to be over the top eager to please but I would like the dog to listen.  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
\* I do prefer if dogs bark at strangers if they're at the door or in our yard but I would want them to be a bit comfortable with strangers.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
\* I have before and I'm willing to again.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  
  
\* Prey drive is a huge one. I have a cat so they need to get along.  
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
\* I hardly leave the house these days so most days will be not at all. If I do go out, it'll be 2-3 hours max.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
\* The only other person is my husband and he doesn't have many preferences. He'll be helping with petting the dog and that's about it. He may help with taking care of the dog if I need help doing it but it'll mainly be my thing.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
\* I have a normal house cat.  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
\* No but we do live by an elementary school so I'd like for them to be okay with children.  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
\* No, we own our house.  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
\* Saskatchewan, Canada. There's a few breed bans in my area but not in my city.  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
\* 85F (29C) for summer and 10F (-12C). There's some days where it's much hotter and some days where it's much colder but those days don't usually last long.  
  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
  
\* We don't have a fully fenced in backyard.

How to process grief and guilt with your childhood dog?,"My childhood dog’s 15th birthday today, as was a vet appointment. We were told quite unexpectedly that we should put her down. They booked her in for tomorrow morning. We knew she was having health issues, but it was way more serious than we thought.

I know most people help themselves to grieve by reassuring themselves about the dog’s long, good life. However, I’m not so sure we gave her the best life.

Yes, she was always fed and bathed and spoiled with toys. She was never crated, and everyone who came by the house would greet her and loved her. But never went for walks, always had long nails, and wasn’t allowed on furniture. When she was little (and I was a child), my family used to punish her for accidents by using Cesar Milan’s methods, or putting her in the garage for hours on end.

Now that I have a dog of my own as an adult, I know what we did was wrong when training her. I know she deserved more outdoor time walking or play time too.

How do I grieve her and let her go? What do I do with this guilt that I should’ve been better?",1,1730257447.0
Seeking advice on life insurance options: Term vs Whole Life at age 50,"I'm looking for expert advice on life insurance planning. Here's my situation:

Currently, I have:

* Company-provided basic life insurance (2x salary, free)
* Additional voluntary life insurance through employer (7x salary)
* The voluntary premium recently doubled to \~$160 per paycheck
* These coverages are employer-dependent and would need to be replaced if I change jobs

After attending some financial seminars, I'm considering switching strategies:

1. Keep only the free 2x employer coverage
2. Use the money I'm currently spending on the 7x coverage to purchase independent term life insurance for both myself and my wife (who is a homemaker)

My main questions:

1. Should I go with term life insurance (20 years) or whole life insurance?
2. Whole life insurance offers additional benefits that appeal to me:
   * Death benefit
   * Disability coverage
   * Pension/cash-out options after age 65
   * Guaranteed payout eventually (since everyone passes away)

Important details:

* I'm 50 years old and my wife 46. I try to take policies both of us unless it financially make sense to take one policy my self
* I usually invest in index funds remaining my savings.
* I have 2 kids. one 9th grade and other 6th grade
* I have 800k mortgage, house worth 2M in current market conditions.
* Whole life would require higher premiums ($2-3K monthly for 5-10 years)
* Term insurance would be cheaper but no additional benefits

What would be the smarter financial decision in my situation? Is the higher cost of whole life insurance worth the additional benefits?",0,1732394719.0
How to reconnect with my dog?,"I have a cane corso that I’ve had since she was a puppy. We’ve been through so many life changes together and I love her to death.

A year ago I became pregnant and things haven’t been the same. While I was I’ve felt so distant from her and irritated with her when I had no reason to. She was just doing her normal doggy things. 

After baby arrived it’s just been a struggle. He was up and about, walking and everything. She gets extremely uncomfortable and has shown warnings so we keep them separated while baby is playing on the floor. When he’s not, the dog can come in And relax with us. I feel awful for keeping her separated but it’s the best option we have until the baby gets older and can understand her boundaries more.  This situation hasn’t helped my feelings of impatience with her.

Stuck with 50K debt and Credit score is 600!

I’ve decided to take more drastic measures and settle with the banks. I spoke with National Debt Relief, which would take about 25% and have me pay off $35k over four years.

It might take more effort, but I’m confident it won’t cost me more than the 25% fee National Debt Relief would charge.

[help] Looking for some sturdy running booties!,"We recently moved to the PNW, and playing fetch in a yard with greenery (as opposed to turf) has been difficult for my lil’ staffy girl. The best way to keep her happy, healthy, and tired is to play 20 mins of fetch twice a day. Unfortunately, there’s tons of little sticks and it’s been slicing up her paws. We do try to rake, etc, but she is almost violently in love with tennis balls and completely disregards her own safety when it comes down to catching them. Ideally, we would make a strip of turf for her to run up and down, but that’s not in the budget right now.

So I’m trying to find a good pair of dog boots that are a) durable enough not to tear in the first five minutes of wear (looking at you, Youly “Adventure” boots) and b) won’t come flying off when she hits top speed.

"House deemed a total loss, we're looking at a rebuild - do we take the payout or keep our mortgage?","Our house was hit by several trees during Hurricane Helene and deemed a total loss by insurance (Allstate). A check for the top of policy limit is currently in the mail, made out to both us and our mortgage company (Mr. Cooper).

The check is for \~315k, and remaining mortgage balance is \~240k. This is our first home and we purchased in 2021, our interest rate is 3.25%.

We've briefly spoken with our mortgage company, and it seems our two options are as follows:

1. Pay off our mortgage in full, take the balance and start from scratch. We'd own our land and get a fresh new construction loan.

2. Mortgage company holds the funds and disperses them as needed to fund rebuild, and then transfers our current mortgage to our new build. (I truthfully don't fully understand how this option works).

We've never gone through something like this, nor has anyone we know personally had to make this decision. Most discussions I find about this online say that the downside to option 1 is less money, because insurance only pays out depreciated value. But that's not quite the case for us.

Personal holding company,"I am considering moving to Norway from the USA. My wife is from Norway and is a Norwegian citizen. I work in the US. My wife does not work. I am to the point where I could soon retire.

- 1.1% wealth tax on all assets
- capital gains taxes on UNREALIZED stock gains

I am afraid if we move to Norway, the retirement money  is destroyed - the taxes are just so brutal.

I have come across two Redditors who suggested looking into forming a holding company in the States and paying myself a salary while living in Norway as a way of possibly skirting around the wealth tax and the capital gains taxes. Of course I would be subject to income tax. 

But I know next to nothing about this idea of establishing a holding company. I am trying to learn about it. I am going to contact a tax attorney soon. But I thought I would try to start educating myself on various aspects of taxes in Norway and the US, in the meantime.

Caught between wanting to buy a house a few years down the line and not wanting to miss out on potential stock market gains,"Hello all. I wonder if anyone else is in a similar situation to me. I would like to buy a home in the next few years, but am stuck in between not really knowing when a home will be affordable to me, and not knowing wanting to miss out on investment gains. I know the last steps of the flow chart say to delineate saving for large purchases in cash or in stocks based on a 3-5 year timeline (right now we have no kids, and live in a very low rent 1 bedroom, so no reason to move), but I feel that I might be right in the middle of this timeline for buying a home (maybe in 4 years). My wife and I have a combined salary of about 185k, and live in a VHCOL area. We have about 140k saved in non retirement funds, and save about an additional 2500 a month in non retirement funds.  We are earlier 30s have about 100k in retirement fund, 15k in an HSA (and contribute regularly to both) and no debts higher than 3% interest (2.5% interest car loan with 14k, 0% interest loan with 3K, 3% interest student loan with 2k). 

  
Because of the situation we are in, where I feel we will likely be looking to purchase a home in 3-5 years, I save 50% of this as cash (HYSA or money market), 15% in conservative mutual funds/ETFs, 15% in growth mutual funds/ETFs, 10% stocks, 10% bonds. Because of stock market gains, only about 55k of our 140k is in cash or equivalents.

House is paid off -- would you move right now?,"Tl;Dr: my husband would prefer a new home to remodeling the one we have. What would you do in this economy?

We fully own our house built in 1984. We've put a lot of time and effort into making it a home including new insulation, new floors, all sorts of new things to make it better and nicer. 

But the one thing that we cannot add or change is the amount of space and the bathrooms. They are small and a constant source of frustration for my husband because we do not really have a ""master suite.""

We also have a considerable plot of land for the area. Only 3/4 of an acre but it's three times as large as most of the lots in our neighborhood. 

Anyway, we paid off the house earlier this year but my husband appears to be getting stir crazy..

We could afford a new home even with a ridiculous interest rates these days, but I'm mixed on whether or not it is ""worth it.""

For reference, homes around here at the size we're looking at are going from anywhere from $350,000 to $700,000.

We could likely spend half of the cost of the kinds of houses that we're looking at and put an addition on our house. But, it would likely mean we couldn't live in it for a period of time while that was happening. This is all just spitballing we haven't gotten any designs or contacted a contractor or anything like that. The home being two story is also complicates things because the addition would have to be both stories as well.

When I bought this house I ensured that I could do it by myself because at the time we were not married yet. We both work in tech so I am very wary of one of us being laid off with no warning and taking on a huge investment when we don't absolutely 100% need to seems silly. But it would be nice to have a larger space to raise our family and be able to support both of our sets of parents as they age.

HSA - Payroll Contribute vs After-Payroll Contribute; How much am I really losing out on?,"I have had a HealthEquity HSA for about 8 years now.  I put the max in each year, and I don't touch it.  It is invested (everything minus 2000 which is the max allowed) in a Target Date Fund (best option I had, don't let perfection be the enemy of the good, etc.).

I have been informed that the partnership in which I am a member\*, will be moving to ThrivePass starting this coming year (2025).  My understanding is everything I had in HealthEquity (8 years and 2 different employers) will remain there.  New contributions, if I elect to go through ""payroll"" deduct, will now go to ThrivePass.  The cost of ThrivePass is $1.10 per month.  (My understanding is HealthEquity has no fee).

My personal situation:

\- Single, no kids/dependents  
\- Make much higher than the SS ""wage base limit""

I've scoured this subreddit and the rest of the internet which seems to think that conventional wisdom says you should do the payroll deduct because you save on the FICA tax.  But if I'm contributing on an after-tax basis, I'm really only losing out on the 3.8% Medicare tax (1.45%+1.45%+0.9%) right?

So on $4300, I'd be losing out on $163.40?  (Minus the monthly fee puts me at $123.2.) But I cam recoup some of that by increasing my ""time in the market"" by contributing all $4300 for the year on 1/1/2025?

\*Extra Credit: For those of you who have already made it htis far and are willing to help me think through this, feel free to ignore this section if it makes things too complex and just answer the questions based on if I were a regular W2 employee.  I'm actually getting this HSA through a partnership in which I no longer have any active activities.  I get a K-1 at the end of the year, but no W2.  I'm guessing the FICA tax would possibly not even be applicable to me since they don't do any withholding, but I'm not 100% sure how that works.

Question 1: Should I maintain 2 HSAs (HealthEquity and ThrivePass), or consolidate into just one?  If so, which one?

Question 2: I'm tired of managing multiple accounts.  If the conclusion is that I'm losing out on much by doing after-tax contributions, is there any world in which it makes sense to transfer my HealthEquity to a brokerage, say Schwab, and contribute after-tax to Schwab from here on out, to consolidate my account to one brokerage (and in the case of Schwab, take advantage of the lower expense ratios)?

Retirement withdrawal ,"Hello, I apologize if this isn’t the right subreddit to ask this question but I have nearly $100,000 in my retirement account from my previous job, all funds are fully vested. 

My retirement was growing steadily until 2021 when my retirement company was purchased by empower, ever since it’s been growing between .6%-.7% every year which seems small considering how much the s&p 500 is up. 

My old company is going out of business and I’m trying to get my retirement plan since I no longer want to be with empower but my old employer is refusing my withdrawal request saying that withdrawals can only be made before 55 if I become permanently disabled. 

I’m just wondering if this is legal, what will happen to my retirement after my old company shuts down? Will I be forced to hold it in Empower until Im 55? ",0,1731861154.0
Help Finding an Adventure Dog,"You know those Instagram posts where they show the first dog, play “I’m just Ken,” then show the second dog they got thinking it would be as amazing as the first dog, and then play “I’m Just Pete” from SNL while the second destroys all the furniture? I’m trying to avoid that, but I’m not sure how. I feel like I won the dog lottery with mine. She’s a mix of APBT, Australian Cattle Dog, Border Collie, Collie, German Shepherd, Pointer, and a few others. She’s one of the smartest, kindest, most loyal dogs I’ve ever known.

It’s an understatement to say she’s smart. She knows probably 50 commands that I hardly even tried to teach her. She just figured them out somehow. One or two repetitions is all it takes. I’m aware I can’t ever replace her, and it tears me up thinking that she’s entering her golden years. Despite all the gray hair and daily Rimadyl, she still keeps up on 10+ mile cross country hikes with me in the Utah desert and is happy to hunt mice around camp after we get back.

She’s about 50lbs, hardly food motivated at all (I can leave bacon on the coffee table, run errands, come back, and it’s still there), eager to please, and most of all, she’s always trying to interact with me. She cares. I’d love to get her a buddy, and I’d especially love it if she helped train a second dog, because it comes very naturally for her to instruct other dogs. She’s a little bossy, but in a good way. When she sees another dog not understand a command, she tries to teach them.

Are there any breeds I should look for?

**Template Provided By This Sub:**

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. I’ve had several my whole life. I’ve trained them, but never extensively.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Rescue

1. Describe your ideal dog.

Hiking/camping/adventure buddy who lounges in the backyard when I’m working from home and won’t chase the chickens. Rough and tumble kind of dog, not a snowflake. Loyal, smart, motivated, active, eager to please. Smart is a must.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Border Collie, Cattle Dog, German Shepherd, Pointer, Foxhound, possibly a Terrier mix but probably not a purebred. Smart, active, outdoorsy.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Good recall, stay, walk by me, don’t eat that, etc. Good outdoor/hiking skills.

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Not really, but rounding up the chickens is helpful.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Variable. Hikes a few hours long to weeklong camping/hiking trips. Afternoon/evening walks when hiking isn’t an option. I work from home but need to be at my desk for most of the workday.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Variable. A couple hours to 12+ hours. Depends on time of year and work.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

All DIY. I can do some, but I don’t want high maintenance.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium. 40-50lbs is a good ballpark. Small enough to carry, big enough to hike long distances and not get harassed by wildlife.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I prefer to minimize these. Barking is probably the biggest problem. I have neighbors.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Medium. I’d love to, but I also usually refrain due to other people’s untrained dogs being off leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A mix of both? A snuggly dog that enjoys or at least doesn’t mind some alone time would be ideal.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Don’t they all bark at the doorbell? No biting is a big one. I like them to be friendly.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Aggression, ignoring me, stealing food

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Most days for at least a few hours. Sometimes longer. Not every day.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

I’m 100% responsible. They would prefer a dog that is well behaved and responsive.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

I have a dog currently and also chickens.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not in the near future

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No. My homeowners (insert word that this sub won't let me post) has breed restrictions/fees, however.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Salt Lake City, UT. No bans here.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer average daytime high is \~100F. Winter average nighttime low is \~20F. It can range from 10F to 110F.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I don’t have time for a project dog. I already have a very busy lifestyle. I want a dog that can join me as part of that lifestyle. This includes hiking, overlanding/4wd exploring, backpacking, exploring off trail in rattlesnake/mountain lion/bear country, and dispersed camping.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

How can I gauge or evaluate for these personality/temperament traits when looking at dogs? How realistic is it to find a rescue that doesn’t need extensive training?",1,1726689944.0
Will a horse randomly attack a dog it doesn’t know? Unsure which flair to use as well.,"Hey, so I moved into a small ranch to help take care of it while the owner is gone. She has a horse, a very big mare, two dogs, a chicken, multiple cats, etc. 

Anyway, she likes to follow my dog around everywhere while I’m walking her on a leash. It makes both me and my dog uncomfortable and I’m scared the horse will try to kick her. So I’ve been having to keep her inside more than I usually would and I’m trying to decide whether it’s safe or not.

My dog doesn’t know how to behave around horses, but she at least doesn’t chase them. The owner said that the horse may kick my dog if threatened, but the problem is that I’m not close with said horse. I don’t know how to properly handle the situation and get them used enough to each other that I can take my dog on walks without having to limit the horse to its pasture.",1,1730140519.0

"Is it okay, if my Amstaff puppy is low energy? Or is she? Please advice.","Hi, I have 5mo Amstaff puppy. According to American Kennel Club website Amstaffs should be 3 from 5 on energy level and also on playfullness. 

But I feel my puppy is most days at 1. Really lazy. It is not a sudden change, she was like this from the first day, but when I iniciated tug of war or played with her with flirt pole, it was easier. Now I have trouble getting her to play and I want her to tire out before I go to work, so she has easier time waiting.

Every morning (6:30) I take her for a half an hour to the dog park. We’re there alone. Because she doesn’t like to play much, I toss her kibble into the grass for her to sniff out, so she has at least mental stimulation.

Then after 2pm, when I come home, I take her to a different dog park, where we sometimes meet her playmates, sometimes I throw her a stick (which she brings back max 10 times), we do obedience and she sniffs. I try to make it an hour session everytime.

Then around 6pm, we go on a walk. Usually an hour/hour and a half.

We live in a flat, that is why I try to be outside with her as much as I can.

Maybe you’ll say that she has enough exercise and that is why she just lays and sleeps beside her time outside, but she doesnt like to do much, even when it is raining and we don’t go out (only for potty). She hates rain and refuses to walk in it.

Is there I can do about a potentially unethical 401k setup?,"**Most 401Ks I've Seen:**

* They offer at least 1 low expense ratio fund/index
* They are fairly easy to roll over into a 401k or IRA

**Prior Employer's Ascensus 401k:**

It only offers high expense ratio funds and it's very hard to roll over:

* Requesting a rollover first requires the participant to set up a notary appointment to notarize the rollover agreement (with an additional witness who also needs to take off work).
* That notarized document must be faxed to Ascensus (they only accept fax) - there no way to verify they received it since all requests go to one number & you receive no confirmation from them.
* My experience (and the experience of a friend who also tried to roll it over but gave up) has been sending the fax multiple times and being told multiple times they don't see it on their side.
* If you are lucky and they process it (which takes a few weeks), you will be given a short window to make the rollover happen due to an Ascensus policy that the notary agreement only unlocks the rollover option for a short window.
* You are not notified when it is processed, so you need to be checking your 401k portal frequently to see if they did it or not to not miss your rollover request window.
* Once processed you can request a check be mailed to you (unlike many 401k providers there is no option to do this online, it must be mailed via check).
* However if you moved you need update your address which by policy locks your account for weeks
* The locking of your account means your notary letter is no longer valid due to the above policy where the letter is only valid for rollovers for a short while
* So you need to restart with faxing a new notarized agreement
* Also at any point if you call and you don't the exact date you were hired off hand they lock your account for weeks as that is one of the (automated) verification questions.

**Why this may be unethical:**

They make a killing on your money sitting in high expense ratio funds (they do not offer low expense funds), so they have a financial stake in setting up a system that intentionally makes that money hard to roll over.",0,1732127479.0
New Dog is Not as She Seemed ...,"This weekend I adopted a rescue dog after years of considering/getting to the right place in life to add a dog to the picture. These first few days have made me question my decision as I (struggle to) adapt to the new routine required and the general disruption to my life. This is normal though right? The internet tells me it's normal.

The bigger annoyance is I feel slightly misled by the rescue who I adopted from. Don't get me wrong, she's a breeze/perfect inside, but outside she's terrible on leash and quite dog reactive. It's not that I'm unwilling to put in the work/work with a trainer/whatever it takes but it would have been nice to know ahead of time what I'm getting into. Mentally I was unprepared for this based on the information from the rescue. 

tl;dr I'm pretty sure some of this is normal frustration/adjustment/etc. but some validation/reminder wouldn't hurt!

**Summer is about 25 Celsius degrees on average, with a somewhat short (5-7 days?) spikes of 35 degrees (this is like 75F / over 90F?), but rarely humid.**

**Winter is like -5C on average, but with short spikes of up to -15C.**

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

**Originally, I really wanted a pug. I've met pugs before and their personality really resonates with me, but I'm seriously concerned about possible health issues and to be honest, if I had a clue how it is in reality (i.e. I imagine some of the issues are largely blown out of proportions considering the dogs' lifespan), this breed would be my choice. I'm looking to get a dog now because I've my life figured out, waited until I would be able to cover any expenses related to the dog (be it food, regular health check-ups or emergency expenses).** 

**From my understanding, malteses are somewhat similar in personality, but healthier (in theory), whereas pekingeses are somewhat in the middle, but again, on one hand I feel this might be a bit overexaggerated.** 

**Health is indeed one of the more important concerns because while I can and am willing to take proper care of the dog's health and wellbeing, my parents had a few dogs (either mutts, shepherd mixes or purebred german shepherds), it was very sad to see them have joint problems at kind of young(ish) age despite proper nutrition, vet visits. This also makes me realise that literally every dog can have serious health problems.**

Night walking gear,"I’ve been taking my dog on a lot more walks than normal lately because he obviously deserves it. Specifically, I’ve been waking up earlier to take him before work. Living in the northeast this was fine in the summer but it’s been getting darker and darker in the morning, so I’m looking for some recommendations for night walking gear for me and my dog

Specifically I’m looking at just ordering from Amazon, but I don’t trust their review system. I’m hoping for some good recommendations from my fellow redditors. I’d also take recommendations on rain walking gear as well. My dog looks like some sort of cross between a husky, shepherd, and Australian kelpie and weighs about 70 pounds.

"first-time dog owner: should I get a dog, and which breed should I get","**Introduction**

Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I have some experience dog-sitting for a friend, but he was a very very well behaved, older golden retriever so I wouldn't consider myself experienced in handling dogs, much less a puppy. 

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I would prefer going through a reputable breeder, but those are quite hard to find in my country (Singapore) so I've been considering importing from a reputable breeder overseas. I'd like to consider adoption, but from what I understand adopted dogs tend to have some trauma from being abandoned/other behavioural problems and I'm not sure if I'm equipped to handle that. 

Describe your ideal dog.

I think the most important trait is quietness- I know that puppies are work, and need to be trained, but I live in an apartment and would like to minimise disturbances to my neighbours as much as possible! I'm okay with some yapping in response to stimuli, but breeds on super high alert (poms, chihuahuas) would be a straight no. 

I usually go on 20-60 min runs everyday, so I think that suits most of the smaller breeds' activity levels? Not sure if that narrows it down a lot except for the exclusion of terriers and shelties. 

I'm don't have much of a preference for grooming needs, barring breeds that need daily grooming- weekly/biweekly is fine. 

Personality and temperament wise- a dog that's happy to cuddle on the couch, but also wants to play! Eager to please personalities would be a bonus as they'd be easier to train (from what I've heard), which would make things easier for me. 

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I did the AKC quiz, and I've narrowed it down to a few: coton de tulear, Japanese chin, Japanese spitz, and cavalier king charles, and golden retrievers (unfortunately they don't fit the housing regulations of my apartment so I can't actually own one, but a smaller breed with a similar temperament would be wonderful)

generally, these 4 breeds (excluding the golden) tend to be less barky, and can be both couch potatoes and affectionate + don't need too much exercise, something like 45-60 min walks should suffice. do let me know if I'm misinformed though! 

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

basic obedience, pee pad training, maybe some simple tricks! more concerned over separation anxiety and being friendly with strangers though as I don't want my neighbours to have to deal with an aggressive dog

Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Nope

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

2-3 hours a day on weekdays but definitely something like 4-5 hours on weekends, excluding walks and feeding him

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

20-60 min walks in the nearby park. there is a nearby dog park, but I've heard that some of the owners who go don't properly vaccinate and train their dogs so I'm not sure if that's the best way to socialise a new puppy/dog. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I'm okay with basic grooming once/2-3 times a week (brushing, cleaning ears, trimming nails etc) at home, but I don't trust myself to cut my own hair so I definitely don't think I should be cutting my dog's fur either. We'd rather pay a professional to do that regularly so we don't accidentally injure the dog.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

definitely medium-small/toy due to our apartment restrictions (no specific weight restrictions, but there is a list of approved breeds)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

shedding is fine, but minimal slobbering as my dad is a bit of a clean freak. the fur isn't an issue as a have a robot cleaner, but he's specifically requested a slobber free dog LMAO. minimal barking too as mentioned above (some barking is fine, but not excessively yappy)

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

not very important? we don't have a balcony or garden, so the dog would have to be on leash in public whenever it's being walked

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

i would LOVE a snuggly dog but I'm also quite partial to cats for their independence so I'm okay with either! 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

eager to please definitely- I don't have experience training a dog, so getting a stubborn dog would definitely be challenging

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

calm, composed, hopefully don't anxious! it'd be best if he was friendly to strangers, but that's not super important as long as he's calm and doesn't get aggressive. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

preferably not- I don't think we're equipped to do that? but we don't have other pets or young children at home so I don't think that would be much of an issue as we don't live in an area with many dogs anyways

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

mostly just barking, aggression, and slobber

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I'm still in university, so this would be a family dog! My parents are okay with providing financial support for its needs, but there will probably be 1-2 days a week where the dog will have to be home alone for at least 4-5, sometimes 6-8 hours (my parents have a hybrid work schedule but have to be in office sometimes, and I'm in school 2-3 days a week, but sometimes our schedules don't line up). Ideally the dog would have to be okay with dealing with separation anxiety (I know this requires training too, but I think some breeds are clingier than others?). As a separate question- knowing that the dog has to be alone sometimes, should I even be getting a dog? I'm worried about the quality of dog walkers/sitters in my area as there has been a spate of unpleasant cases recently, and I don't want to run that risk. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

I'd be the one walking and grooming the dog, but it'll be a family dog and my parents are paying for the expenses. no one in the family has any allergies so that shouldn't be an issue

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

nope

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

nope

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

no, we own. the breed restrictions are here: [https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/keeping-pets](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/keeping-pets) (generally small-medium dogs)

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

NA, just the above.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

we live near the equator, so it's usually either really sunny (29-32 degrees  in the day) or very rainy (thunderstorms) but when it rains, usually a few times a week, it's quite cooling (27 degrees ish)

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

Given the above time and breed restrictions, should I even be getting a dog?

I disputed a charge with Wells Fargo and got denied.,"I got approved for a Wells Fargo credit card back in September, but I never received the card in the mail. Then, I noticed in my Wells Fargo app that there was a $400 purchase at Home Depot in a town I’ve never been to. I called Wells Fargo to report this, and they refunded the amount and sent me a new card with a new number.

However, I recently saw that the $400 charge has been added back to my account. I called Wells Fargo again to figure out what’s going on. Their fraud department informed me that the original card was activated using my phone number, so the charge was reinstated. (I never activated the original card since I never received it, and I have no idea how this could have happened.)

I also called the Home Depot where the purchase occurred and spoke with someone there. They told me the $400 purchase was for gift cards. They even sent me a photo of paperwork showing that whoever made the purchase had tried to use two other cards first, both of which were declined, before successfully using my card.

Wells Fargo said they would get back to me within 48 hours. However, they seem to think I made the purchase since the card was activated using my phone number. Lately, I’ve been receiving strange spam calls and texts, which I don’t respond to, but I’m worried this might be connected.

I’m concerned that I won’t get the $400 refunded. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!


UPDATE #1: sorry i didn’t mean to put dispute. This was reported as fraud but was ultimately denied and i was still charged $400. I’m gonna do most of what everyone has suggested in the comments. I think what may work most in my favor is that i have phone records showing that i did not make the call when the card was apparently activated by my phone number. This probably means that my number was spoofed(?). 

Please don’t make the same mistake i made and bank with WF. I appreciate everyone’s help in this thread. You’re all great! I hope to provide a positive update soon.",0,1731679803.0
How can I make my retirement financial models more accurate? Does my approach hold up?,"I'm 33, and I'd like to retire at 62, with my wife retiring at the same time at 56.

# Desires:

1. Ability to die at home, not in a nursing home.
2. Have 10 years' worth of 24/7 at-home nurse coverage when my wife and I can no longer take care of ourselves.
3. Have \~$5,000/month for all other fixed and variable living expenses.

**First model:**

# Assumptions:

* My wife and I pass away at the same time: ages 94 and 88 (big assumption, I know).
* 3% annual inflation.
* Our primary residence is paid off before retirement.
* Long-term care insurance we'd purchase in our 40s or 50s offsets some nursing costs.
* **Estimated cost of 24/7 in-home nursing care (47 years from now):** \~$72,214/month (or \~$8M over 10 years). (ChatGPT generated)
* Long-term care insurance + Medicaid covers \~$2M worth of 24/7 nurse cost over 10 years
   * Assumes Medicaid covers 25% of 24/7 in-home nursing care

**First model total retirement needs:** \~$9M.

# Second Model:

# Assumptions:

* Same as the first model, but with **2% inflation** instead of 3%.
* Long-term care insurance + Medicaid covers \~$2M worth of 24/7 nurse costs over 10 years.

**Second model total retirement needs:** \~$6M.

# Question:

Does this approach make sense? How can I refine these models to be more accurate or realistic? The retirement needs figures feel huge, and I'm wondering if I’m missing something critical.

Finance a Newer Car or Cash for Older Car,"Hi,

I am looking at getting my first car! I am looking to get a Prius to save on expensive California gas prices. Here are the two options I am considering:

1) Buy an older used car 2009-2013, 130k-180k miles, $6-11k (Pay in cash)

2) Finance a newer used car 2018-2022, 40k-100k miles, $19-23k (Finance  \~7.5%)

  
Alright here is where it gets a little more interesting. If I were to finance a new car I would also look to get a Prius Prime (plug in model). This Prius qualifies for the 4k [used EV tax credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit).  This credit would essentially cover dealer fees and interest payments (assuming a 7.5% APR on $17\~20k, 48 month loan) So in essence I would be taking a 0% APR loan. As someone who likes to invest my money the opportunity cost here seems very enticing. I would be looking to put down like 5K just to bring the total loan amount down.

  
So here are the pros and cons of each option:

1) Buy older used car with cash

Pros:

* No car payments (extra point for mental health lol)
* Cheaper
* Cheaper registration fees
* Cheaper insurance

Cons:

* Higher maintenance costs (not sure how to attach a dollar amount to this, plz help!)
* Lower resale value

  
2) Finance a newer used car

Pros:

* 4k tax credit
* My work has free EV charging
* Less maintenance
* Having a newer car is nice lol
* Car loan is good long term for credit score

Cons:

* More expensive
* Higher registration fees
* Higher insurance costs

  
TLDR: Should I buy a cheaper older car for cash or finance a newer used car at 0% APR b/c of a tax credit. 

Your advice is appreciated!",0,1731777787.0
Buyer's Remorse? Thinking of selling my new car for a cheaper one.,"Hi everyone, 

I'm seeking advice on of it's a sensical decision to sell my current car that I bought new for a cheaper one that I'll have paid off sooner; or if I should just keep grinding away and accept the sunk cost.  

Long story short, I got divorced a year ago and was in need of a car. Maybe hastily, I bought a 2024 Subaru Crosstrek. I'm overall pleased with the car. I don't really want to sell it, but I hate having a car payment more than I thought I would. I'm definitely feeling the strain on my wallet. And, I'd rather use the funds for savings and travel. 

I split the financing between an auto loan at 5.39% and a HELOC at 3.25%. The total original balance was around $32,000.

The current balance on the auto is \~ $11,800 and payments are $300/mo. 

The current balance on the HELOC is \~ $14,200. Minimum payment \~ $140, but I am paying $300. 

The reason I'm paying more on the HELOC is because I'd like to free up the funds to actually use for my home improvements. 

So total debt against the car is \~ $26k. I've paid down around $6k in a year and a half. 

Between the two loans, trying to pay it off early,  I am paying $600/mo for it, which I can swing but I'm definitely feeling the pinch. Auto insurance is about $80/mo. 

For simplicity's sake and not having a back up car in the meantime, I'm assuming I would end up trading at a dealership and best case, break even on the debt against it.  

I do also get a small bonus in the new year where I'd apply at least $1,500 towards the auto loan. 

  


A couple of options going on in my head to get out of this loan:

1.) Trade and get a $10-$15k car---then I have to worry about breaking down/maintenance without a back up car or person. I estimate this would be \~ $10k less of a loan though.

2.) Decrease 410k contributions from 11% down to 5% which is the company match- this would free up \~$200/mo to apply to a loan. I am currently earning 8% on my 401k though. 

3.) Just keep my head down. Eat beans and rice. Apply any extra funds to the auto loan. 

  
Any advice/input welcome! Thank you!!

Former Employer Asking Me to Cash Out a 401(k) I Didn’t Know About,"
I didn’t know about this until now, but my former employer from an internship I did over a year ago recently contacted me about a 401(k) account with American Funds. They told me there’s about $500 in it. I called the number they gave me, and they confirmed the amount.

According to my former employer, I can’t keep the money in their plan, so my only option is to cash it out. Since it’s an early withdrawal, I know they’ll take out taxes and penalties. I’m not sure how this even got set up, since I didn’t signing anything.

Has anyone been through this? Is there a way to avoid losing so much to taxes/penalties? Should I try to roll it into a different account instead?

I'm looking for my dream dog breed(s) for when I can have a dog :) Right now i'm 22 and the dog is not for right now it's for in a few years when I have a stable job, etc So I wanna know what dog I'm gonna get because I think it's fun! I've always wanted a dog and even if I'm not ready, I want to know what my dream breed is!  
  
1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* Yes, first dog!!  
  
2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* I don't! Whatever is gonna get me a healthier dog I guess  
  
3)Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* My ideal dog is super cuddly, likes to chill and is at least mostly calm. I want a dog that's not gonna bark intensely and bother neighbours every time someone approaches my door. Also, for financial reasons, I'd like it to be a healthy dog!  
  
4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* I've done a lot of googling, and some examples of breeds that interest me (I used [chewy.com](http://chewy.com) to see the dogs that have the traits I like, so I hope their info is good) are the Greyhound, Papillon, Borzoi, Rat Terrier or maybe a Mastiff? or Tibetan Mastiff?. Also, the Shetland Sheepdog is I think like my ideal dog esthetically, but apparently they're super barky so I wouldn't have one.  
  
5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* Whatever I can i'd say? Like I don't necessarily need a super easy to train dog, but I wanna be able to train him still and make him do basic stuff! More trainability is a good bonus, but not a like requirement  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* no  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* An hour or two?   
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* I visit the local park daily, which includes a dedicated dog park area. I can commit like1 hour of outdoor activity, combining walks, interactive play, and relaxed time together. While I'm not a runner, I'm an enthusiastic walker and would ensure my dog gets plenty of exercise through both leashed walks and off-leash play at the dog park. Also, I have to say I don't have a car and live in a kinda big city, so I'd rarely have the occasion to bring him in ""real"" nature! I would like too though I gotta look If I can bring dogs In my city's trains maybe  
  
9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* If he needs brushing, I'll brush him all he needs! Though I would prefer a dog I don't need to bring to a professional regularly so for the ""main"" brushing and grooming I want it to be simple enough that I can learn easily and do it at home  
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)What size dog are you looking for?  
  
\* Medium to large ideally!   
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* Shedding and slobber I don't really mind, but barking i'd want it to be on the quiet side  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* Not really, If I can that's great! If it's better not to that's fine too  
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* Snuggly!!!!! 100%  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  
  
\* Ideally a bit of both, I dont mind that much  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
\* I worked in a door to door job once, and I really don't want a dog that barks every time someone goes up to the front door. Ideally he's not gonna bark at friends when I have people over, but it's rare and I don't do parties or anything it's always calm at home. I don't mind if he's gonna love visitors or be more scared of them, as long as he's not like aggresive 

  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
\* Honestly, I'm not sure yet I have to do more research on that

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
\* No  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
\* I live in Montreal and here there is no breed restrictions  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
\* In the winter, it's average -20°C (-4°F) and on the very coldest days it's -30°C (-22°F) and in the summer it gets as hot as 30°C (86°F)",1,1730509148.0

Maxing out 401K: Traditional or Roth?,"I'm starting a new job with a 6% company match 401k. However, that has to be pretax contribution. But after that 6%, the rest can be Roth 401k contributions. They do NOT allow the mega backdoor Roth, I checked. My Roth IRA is already maxed out.

I make 80K at this role, in side contracts about 30K a year which keeps me just a hair into the 24% tax bracket even if I maxed out the traditional 401K to lower my taxed income.

Do I do Roth for the longer term flexibility, or risk Traditional and get another 300 a month in-pocket that I can divert to a taxed account?

I need help understanding a 401k withdraw. ,"So I’m experiencing financial hardship. I unexpectedly got fired from my job. On top of that I’m in the process of appealing my unemployment that was originally denied. I have never been super financially savvy. I’m 25 years old and I live in NY. I have some money in credit card debt. And without the unemployment I wouldn’t be able to make rent as I don’t have much of a cash savings. I don’t have any family to support me or ask for any advice on this. My credit score isn’t great due to my card habits so I can’t apply for a new or higher limit credit card. 

I was making 75k a year. I’m taxed at 22%. I currently have 80k in my 401k. I was depositing around 15% of my paycheck to my 401k and this includes some bonuses from my employer that are fully vested.

I just want to make sure I’m properly understanding how a withdraw would work. So if I were to take out say 15k. There would be a 10% penalty due to my age so $1,500. The income tax applied would be my 22% so $3,300. So I would have the $10,200 leftover. My intent with this money is to pay off my credit card debt (about 4k). And then keep the remainder for my rent and utilities while I appeal unemployment and job search. 

So I’m assuming Vanguard would auto take out their 10%. So would my withdraw just transfer into whatever checking account I place it in? And then I should just put the $3,300 aside in a savings account to have when taxes are due right? ",0,1732206044.0

2: Potentially look into my wife applying for an IDR to reduce minimum payments so we can put more towards the highest interest loan or pay minimums until Loan Forgiveness. Haven't found a solid answer on how exactly the forgiveness aspect of the IDR works. 

3: Extending the Terms of the low interest rate loans and putting the minimum payments saved towards the high interest loans to pay them off quicker.

"Asked boss for a raise, now I need to tell them how much ","I asked for a raise after not receiving one since 2020.

I have worked for this company for 9 years 7 months. I’ve technically been in my current position for 4 years 6 months. 

Is 15% too much? I was told we would set up some goals to achieve in order to get to the pay increase I ask for, but I want to be realistic in my request. This is my first time ever asking for a raise, so any advice is appreciated!

Please Help - Should I Drop Out of Flight School?,"Background: 22 year old m located in the Midwest. No college degree. I work an entry level job and make approximately 40k a year.

  
My debt:

Vehicle Loan - 12k @ 12%

Credit Card - 11k @ 15%

Student loans - 12k @ 2-5%

  
This was my situation a few months ago. I still have this debt now. Instead of paying off this debt, I enrolled in flight school to become a pilot. I was approved for a loan to cover the entire cost of my training. This is where it gets incredibly sickening the position I am in. 

So far I’ve used 20k of this loan, which is at a whopping 18% interest rate. The rest is able to be used, but not yet used yet. This also isn’t gaining any interest at this time.

So right now, I am over 50,000 dollars in debt with interest rates as high as 18%.

  
Do I drop out of flight school and grind for several years to get zero debt, and then continue my way through and pay with cash? Or, am I too far in, and I should keep going with flight school and use the rest of the 80k of borrowed money at my disposal? If I did this, I’d graduate the program about a year and a half from now at 150k worth of debt.

Large(ish) Apartment Dogs?,"Introduction

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* It will be my first personal dog, but I have experience working at a boarding kennel and occasionally lending a hand in obedience training family members’ dogs. I also have pet-sitting experience, and while it wasn’t my own personal dog, I helped my grandparents raise a Shih Tzu (trained, fed, played, walked, brushed her).

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* No major preference, but a well-bred dog would be nice for temperament’s sake. I don’t want to take a risk with reactivity to smaller animals, so if I would get a shelter dog I’d make sure they’re cat-friendly.

3. Describe your ideal dog.

* (Highly) Trainable, sociable with their family, **cat-friendly**. I’d like to have a dog that could hang on the couch with me, or be down to explore the city—maybe hike on rarer occasions! Mostly, though, I’m looking for a mellow cuddle buddy that can also learn cool tricks. A dog that can play, but knows when to settle down or be gentle around smaller animals. I work from home, so separation isn’t a huge issue, but I’d like to avoid one prone to destructive tendencies/separation anxiety when left home alone for several hours. I’m perfectly fine with crate-training as well. Cat-friendly is a must, since we have one feline resident already with another on the way this upcoming month.

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Both my partner and I are fans of medium-large sized breeds. Breeds I’ve been looking into are Rough/Smooth Collies, Golden Retrievers, and Eurasiers. I love other Spitz breeds (such as Chows and Samoyeds), Borzois, and have experience with Dobermans (my favorite breed) but am unsure if they’d be an ideal fit for our lifestyle as of now. My partner’s favorite breeds are Basset Hounds, Labradors, Shar Peis and Golden Retrievers, but I’m trying to avoid Bassets/Shar Peis for the meanwhile due to their health issues. A small breed isn’t a dealbreaker, but we’d like a dog that could be roughhoused with during playtime.

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I love teaching dogs obedience training and “neat tricks” in general. I might be interested in agility work but am not 100% set on it. I’m wanting a dog that will obey commands, so biddability is huge. Optimally, I could find a breed that will take well to Service Animal work, as I’m disabled—again, not a dealbreaker, but it could be a huge bonus.

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I’ve taught a good handful of dogs obedience commands over the years and would like to hone in on that ability via my own dog. I have no experience in agility but think it could be fun to get into!

Care Commitments

7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I’d like to interact with my dog for most of the time that I’m home! I prefer having a lap animal as opposed to one that doesn’t want anything to do with me, but if a dog just wants to lay near me on the couch that’s fine too. Ideally I’d want to dedicate an hour or two each per day to training and playing, though I’d be available for a bit more time on the weekends.

8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* By the time we’d get the dog we could very well be living in another residence with a yard. For the time being, though, we live in an apartment with a dog park nearby. Otherwise, neighborhood walks, occasional hikes, and fetch.

9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I’d be comfortable with everything but trimming hair! I’d go to a professional for that. I don’t mind brushing at all since I’ve lived with a Shih Tzu before.

Personal Preferences

10. What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium-large size

11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is no problem. Slobber isn’t my thing. I can handle some barking, such as “conversing” with me through barks, but I can’t handle excessive barking at 3 AM, or anytime a neighbor walks by.

12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not very important

Dog Personality and Behavior

13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I wouldn’t mind a bit of both! I love cuddly dogs but am fine if they want to do their own thing here and there. I don’t want a dog that wants nothing to do with me or my family, but I have a cat or two to keep me company should the dog want their own “me-time”.

14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please would definitely be great for training, but I really don’t mind independence, either—I’m a cat owner. I get it.

15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* An alert bark or two is fine if they’re coming up to the door, but I’d prefer them to stay calm upon someone entering (though, that typically comes with training, of course). Whether they’re aloof to strangers or come right up to them doesn’t matter to me.

16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I’d rather not. I would like to live in a multi-dog household eventually, and I have a few family members wanting “doggy playdates” once I do get a dog.

17. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I want to avoid separation anxiety and animal aggression entirely. In the future, I hope to own other animals, and want to keep conflicts at a minimum.

Lifestyle

18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work from home, but go out just about every other day. A standard amount spent without humans present would maybe be 4-5 hours when I’m out?

19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* We’ll be splitting pet care 50/50. My partner likes dogs that can play hard but have an off-switch, and enjoys “goofy” dogs in general. Dogs that act silly and are perhaps lacking a few qualifications in the thinking department are his favorites—really, he’s just looking for a buddy to watch TV and tussle with. Happy-go-lucky.

20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have a dog-savvy cat! He came from a foster home with several dogs and got along just fine with them. I have another cat on the way, who is also from a multi-pet household. Eventually, a good bit further into the future, I’d like to keep reptiles/fish/insects.

21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not planning on it. Though, there are children in my family, should I ever want to bring my dog to a social gathering or should one of my relatives bring their kids over. Being able to tolerate older children at the least would be a plus.

22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We’re renters! By the time we get a dog, we may very well be living in another apartment, as mentioned above. Since we’re not planning on getting a dog now, just assume there’s no restrictions! Just looking for suggestions, after all :)

23. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA resident here! There are no cases of any breed bans in my state or city.

24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* The weather here is fairly moderate. Average summer days are 70-80 F, with the hottest of days MAYBE approaching 90. Winter days are are a bit harsher, being anywhere from 30-40 on average, and 10-25 on more extreme days.

Additional Information and Questions

25. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Emphasis on the not getting a dog now part!! There will at minimum be another year before we get one.

26. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* Anything you wish you knew before owning a dog? Any tips for introducing a dog to a feline household? For any of the aforementioned dog breeds, is there anything people neglected telling you about the breed before you got one?",1,1727649357.0
Toss debt collection notice (2 yrs old)?,"I was recently sent a debt collection notice from Cedars Business Services with the noted creditor being the police department of Siena, Italy. I was in Siena 2 years ago, and did rent a car. I likely got caught by a speed box. I received a notice from this debt collection firm after it happened, and even paid the $350 they said I owed. I haven’t received any notice of non-payment since (my address changed once, and I had mail forwarding), and now they’re saying I owe an additional $350, presumably for a second ticket I got. How would you approach this? I live in MA and this appears to be a CA-based agency, if that helps. ",0,1732033967.0
My dog is obsessed with my kitten,"I have a 2 year old pit bull mix (believed 50% pit and 50% boxer mix). She's a high strung dog, and has attachment anxiety, but she does fine with her behavior and hasn't had an accident or chewed anything since she was about 6 months. 

 I say she's attached because she follows us around all the time. To the bathroom, the kitchen, outside, etc. She'll wake up from a dead sleep if someone leaves the room. 

Anyway, about a month ago we fostered a litter of 4 week old kittens. She was anxious around them, but tried to mommy them right away. We stopped this as much as we could, but it still happened occasionally. By mommy I mean trying to clean them and cuddle them, watching over them in their box, and generally worrying about them. 

Now we are down to just the little Grey female kitten, who we are keeping,  and our dog is completely obsessed. She is constantly aware of where the kitten is, she tries to give her baths, they cuddle, she let's the kitten play with her, etc. We are making sure to spend several hours with just the dog so that we retain routines without the kitten getting in the way. 

Shes not aggressive at all, but she is very reactive, especially to new people and other animals. She just wants to play, but she's crazy excited and she scares people. 

I know that any dog can bite, and I worry that we're not handling it right. Is this anxiety a red flag? How do we intercept this? For clarity, the kitten is about 8 weeks old now. ",1,1726434789.0
"$4k credit card debt, $4k in hard cash. $22/hour job. NEED CAR ASAP","22 M. I got kicked out of my parents house. Exhausted all friends houses, no relatives to stay with. I'm on my own. Not here to weep. Just explaining my situation so I can get the proper help.

I have a job that pays $22 an hour. I've been trying to get a car so I can uber and live out of it for a little so I can pay off my credit cards and save money.

I want a toyota or honda used around 120k miles, \~8k-10k. I found some that are good. I'd rather pull out a loan for something more reliable I can do uber with and make the money back, instead of spending my last $4k on a janky car that I couldn't even make money out of. Also something I could keep for a couple of years.

  
I'm cool with being in the hole for a little, as long as I have something reliable. I have a credit union through my job at target but interest rates are horrible, it was looking like 8.19% for a 6 year term for a 2014 toyota camry with 128k miles. 

I don't really know what to do. If I can get a good car loan, I'm fine with sleeping in my car, (obviously keeping it clean for passengers). I can save money, work my job and do uber on the side, pay off my credit card debt, save my money, and then save up and build my credit to get a good apartment I enjoy.

My dog is obsessed with GOING outside,"I have a two-year-old hound mix who has always been a really big fan of being in the backyard. I have a sizeable backyard and she loves listening and looking out for squirrels, chasing lizards and frogs, etc. However, in the last year or so, her behavior about going outside has become a little exhausting. 

From the moment we get out of bed in the morning, she is rushing to the back door to go outside. I let her out and she's usually back at the door begging to come inside within a few minutes. Weather permitting, we go out on a 30-45 minute walk then we come back home so I can start working. She proceeds to spend the rest of the day begging me to go back outside-- any move I make, she rushes to the back door and does her Good Sit (equivalent to ""place"") to wait until I open the door. If I do, she runs outside to find her prey, whatever it may be. Within 30-90 seconds, she's back at the door begging to come inside-- barking, scratching, whining. When I let her in, she spends about 30 seconds being normal before she is back at the door doing her Good Sit. If I do not let her out, she lays by the back door, whines and scratches at it, and eventually will come into my office to lay around and look miserable. 

It's become clear that she isn't interested in BEING outside-- she likes GOING outside. She shakes and whines with anticipation before I give her her break command and she's frantic searching for prey immediately out the gates. As soon as she realizes there is nothing there, she is back begging to come inside. I want my dog to have outside time, and I let her out 3-5 times a day, but I will not be getting up every two minutes to give her that rush.

When I go out there with her, she spends a little longer sniffing around but eventually ends up back at the door wanting to go in. I do spend some time out there with her daily, but I cannot spend all day sitting in my backyard watching my dog sniff around. I have work to do!

I have tried everything in my power to enrich her outside of letting her out. We tried barn hunting last year (she didn't give a rat's ass, literally). We walk daily but she doesn't seem to get much from it-- she is always pulling back home to make it into the backyard. We have tried puzzle toys and she's very smart, usually finishes them within a few minutes. We used to have a few dog friends we saw regularly but she was constantly being bitten so we are on a play date break at the moment. We don't do dog parks. I'd love to take her off-leash to explore somewhere but her recall is not perfect, and I don't think it will ever be due to her instincts, so we are limited there. 

I have tried just leaving her in the backyard but she will literally sit back there and howl, scream, jump on the door, etc. until I let her in, just to turn around and beg to go back out. I'm at my wit's end! I don't know what to do from here!! Any advice/similar experiences? ",1,1726499186.0

What Dog Breed Should I Get?,"I am a man in my mid 20’s looking for a male puppy.  Can someone please recommend an ideal breed?  I filled out the questionnaire below. 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I had a Yorkie and Maltipoo when I was younger, but my parents did most of the training.  Also, they had pee pads in the house they would go to the bathroom in, whereas I would prefer my dog to go outside.  

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would prefer to get a puppy from a reputable breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* A low maintenance dog that is devoted, protective, affectionate, and easy to train.  Also, I want his breed to have a generally healthy profile.  Finally, I want his energy level to be low-moderate because I don’t want him to get separation anxiety when I’m out or at work. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I’m open to any breed that meets the criteria I’m laying out in this post.  

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Potty training (not going inside and letting me know he has to go outside), sitting, staying, fetching, and to stop barking if I tell him to

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 1-2 hours on weekdays (potentially 3 on some days if I’m not too busy), at least that much on weekends.  

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30-60 minutes a day.  Occasionally we can jog, run, go to the dog park, or even hike but mostly going for walks and playing in the yard or indoors.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am willing to brush once or twice a week but would prefer to do less.  I would be willing to learn how to clean his ears but would leave hair trimming to a professional (hopefully not too often). 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* A medium-large sized dog, anywhere in the range of 25-85 pounds.  

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I want to keep shedding and slobber to an absolute minimum.  I would prefer a dog that isn’t overly vocal and only occasionally barks to alert me so he could function as a watchdog (for example, if there is an attempted break in during the middle of the night he can wake me up).

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be nice, especially at the dog park or in my front yard.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in the middle, I love cuddling and petting dogs and occasionally sleeping in my bed with them but there are times that I need personal space as well.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I prefer a dog that is independent enough to be able to entertain itself and doesn’t need my constant attention  24/7.  However, not indifferent to the extent that a cat is (no shade to cats, I like them in their own right but I want something different), I still want some enthusiasm when I get home or want to spend time with him.  

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don’t mind if he barks at someone knocking on the door or someone he doesn’t know entering the yard.  However, if he sees that I am comfortable with someone (friends, family, etc.) he should be friendly as well, or at least not antagonistic and open to warming up to them.  

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Somewhat, although I would like to avoid an overly aggressive breed if possible.  

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work a 9-5 so he would have to be okay being alone while I’m at work.  I do plan on spending quality time with him every day, more so on the weekends, but even then I’m not the kind of person to bring my dog with me everywhere I go out.  

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone right now, but am seriously considering moving in with either my friend or my girlfriend in the not so far future when my lease is up.  My friends and girlfriend would be okay with it and would help me take care of him but of course the main workload is still mine.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* My girlfriend has a cat, so my dog would have to coexist with him.  My sister has a smaller dog (less than 15 pounds) so hopefully they could coexist as well.  I don’t care if he hates small non-pet animals like squirrels or rodents.  In fact, that could be good for pest control.  

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No, so he doesn’t have to be the best with kids when he does interact with them, but of course I don’t want a dog prone to being aggressive towards kids either.  

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* N/A

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* The US, no I’m not.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Mid 60s-high 80s in the summer, mid 30s-mid 50s in the winter

"[Breeds] Research all blending together, would love breed recommendations","**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* It will be my first dog but not my partner’s. I have experience living with and helping train a husky puppy, but she was not my dog.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Slight preference towards working with a reputable breeder as we have a cat and I would like to instill good boundaries from puppyhood. I also want to ensure I know the background and breed of the dog (ie no terriers of any kind) due to prey drive concerns.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* An intelligent dog with interest in hiking, learning tricks, and agility, who would be predisposed to live well with a cat with proper training. I would also like a dog who is comfortable with traveling or with occasionally being watched or boarded for trips they could not attend. I work from home and would be home with the dog at most times.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I am interested in herding dogs due to their intelligence and demeanor, but I would want to ensure a dog would be a good fit before taking on a responsibility and worry that some herding dogs would not do well with pet sitting or boarding.

I have also considered retrievers as from my research they seem to be fairly adaptable, confident, and good with cats.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I would like to train the dog to have good recall, as I live near an off leash hiking trail. I would also like to continuously train tricks for bonding and mental stimulation.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I would love to try agility even without needing to compete. I don’t have any experience in this but would like to work with a local training facility to learn. I would be interested in obedience competitions as well.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* This is flexible as I work remotely, but I want to ensure I do not take on too much responsibility in case I ever needed to work in the office. If I were to work in an office, I would likely be home and awake for 6-7 hours a day and could probably devote 1-2 of those to exercise/training specifically.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours a day. This would include hiking on an off-leash dog trail and walking in a neighborhood. I do also have access to a dog park and I would be interested in participating with a local agility gym.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am open to doing some grooming at home, but would take a dog with more needs (like a rough collie or other dog with a long coat) regularly to a groomer.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* I would prefer a medium to large size dog, but my priority is finding the right fit with the cat and temperament.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I am used to handling extensive shedding. I prefer less barking and slobber if possible for harmony with the cat. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in between.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please for recall training. I loved my time living with a husky but I know owning one is not a good choice for off leash hiking and living with a cat.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I would prefer a confident dog who is comfortable with all of the things. I feel confident working on general reactivity but would not like a dog that is predisposed to greet strangers with aggression, particularly if I ever wanted to use a dog walker or dog boarding facility. I am not concerned about some barking to alert but would prefer not to try to work against a dog’s instincts to constantly keep them quiet.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I would work with a trainer if this were the case. Because I have a cat, I would prefer to adopt a puppy and work from an early age on socialization. I would prefer a dog that is not predisposed to fighting other animals.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Fighting or attacking other animals.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* On a typical day, no more than 2 hours. I work from home and will be with the dog at all times other than running a quick errand.
On the weekend after the dog is an adult, this timeframe could be longer depending on the dog’s needs, but I would prefer that they could be left alone occasionally for 6-8 hours if we ever wanted to take a day trip or had a lot of errands to run.

I would also like a dog who is confident and adaptable enough to occasionally be pet sat by family/friends/or a professional or be boarded so we have the option to occasionally take a vacation that isn’t dog friendly.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My partner will be home in the mornings and evenings and will help with both of these routines and dog walking, as well as training. My partner prefers large dogs.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a 7 year old cat. She has interacted well with a husky, border collie, and a Great Pyrenees. She did not get along with a doodle who played very aggressively with other dogs and her.

No other pets are currently planned.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* ANSWER

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We rent currently and cannot have many large breeds and breeds with high prey drives, including huskies, malamutes, akitas, pitbulls and other bully breeds, malinois, and German shepherds.

We are not given a complete list or weight limit in the lease and would confirm with the landlord before proceeding.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA, no breed bans where I live.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Winter: snowy winters, 30 degrees Fahrenheit
Summer: hot dry summers, 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit

Best/typical approach to managing move to new house?,"My current house is paid off and we're considering a move to a new house that is more expensive.  I'm trying to understand the options regarding the transition.  For example, we could take out an entire new mortgage on the new place and then pay it down like crazy when the old house sells, or we could take out a bridge loan, or make a contingent offer.  It's worth some $$ for us to not be rushed like crazy, or even have some overlap time since we'll be in the same city and the move would be easier.

Background: I'm making roughly $200k a year, so I can't put money into Roth IRA, and I can't get tax deduction on IRA. So I thought if my after-tax IRA contribution is non deduction anyway, why not just roll over all that into Roth IRA and I don't pay tax again. But I already had some money (roughly 37k) in IRA. So if I put more into IRA, that will become mixed up and I have to pay tax, so I'm thinking about roll over IRA to 403b to empty that out before making new IRA contribution.

Assessment: it's gonna be complex for taxation purposes, but I wonder if there is any hole in my plan before I need to address?

Recommendation: anything else I need to consider? Is it worth it to go through all that hassle to save tax? I have about 20 years of work left. I assuming I contribute $7000/year, I will save $140k plus growth from my investment.",0,1732074580.0
Help finding a dog that ok with cats?,"I’m having a hard time picking a dog because my only deal breakers are not being good with cats/ if they aren’t the best with them they’d preferably be ok with create training. I’m willing to change my life for them but them being alright to go on morning walks and being ok for 5 hours is preferred, and being a small to medium dog (medium preferably). Dog will be socialised with the cat as a puppy 

1)    Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes and no, it’ll be my first dog I’ve owned but I’ve lived with rough collies, kelpies and a gsp before but more of a playing with them and taking care of them when their owners couldn’t.

3)    Describe your ideal dog.

*small to medium 

4)    What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

5)    What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* ideally they’d be able to do tricks but it’s not a deal breaker, important ones would be crate training, potty training, being able to sit/stay and off leash

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

*as much as they need, they’d be going to a dog park preferably at least once a week for as much as they’d need. I’m decently active but I’d be willing to tone it down for the dog.

9)    How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Willing to do all grooming or pay for it if I can’t. Had experience grooming other dogs

**Personal Preferences**

10)    What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium ideally

*not really a deal breaker but preferably they’d be able to 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I’d gladly do that but that’s not an option where I live so less prone to aggression/ lower prey drive is preferred.

Grief process for surviving dog,"We had to say goodbye to my 10 year old GSD on Monday. It happened quickly and was definitely unexpected.

Should I sell my car and buy a beater to maximize monthly saving?,"I just cracked six figures this year and started to be able to legitimately save money for the first time.

I work from home, so in the time that I have owned it, I have put only about 12k miles on it. According to kbb, it's worth at least what I owe on it (~24k) if not more. 

I have around 12k saved up as the beginning of an emergency fund. If you were in my shoes, would you sell the truck and buy a 10-12k car outright in order to start saving $1000 per month? I would be starting over on my emergency fund, but it would only take me a year to get back to where I started.

Modified Budget After Switching to New Job with No 401k For 1 Year,"Looking for any feedback, 25M living in a HCOL area, just switched jobs (higher salary + shorter commute).  But the new job doesn't have an option for a 401k for 1 year, so I made some changes to my budget.  Currently living with my girlfriend and looking to buy a house in roughly 2 years.  Have 56k saved up between Roth IRA and 401k and 60k saved in a brokerage account.  Current emergency fund has $1,800 and my monthly costs are  $4500.  Would it be better to aggressively allocate towards the emergency fund rather than brokerage?

I totaled my car earlier this year and decided to buy a new car (37k) and drive it to the ground.  I've got 8k left on that, so about a year left of car payments.

Any other feedback is welcome! Thanks!

Options to fund shares purchase in S-corp?,"I am the operations manager at a privately owned engineering firm in TX, USA. A minority owner is retiring at the end of the quarter, and the majority owner is offering me a chance to buy those shares and become a partner in the firm. The shares are a ballpark of $1 million.

The business does well financially, and I am going through the due diligence to ensure this is the right decision.

I'm 26 and just got my first High paying job. I've always lived in poverty and I'm lost?,"So, I just turned 26 in August, did 4 years in the military and completed college and got (what I would consider) A high paying job in tech a month ago. Roughly $145k a year after bonus. I almost completed my PhD so the company I work for gave me a tier 3 or Principal/senior title for work which is very nice. Most of my life I've always lived on the poor side to where 25-50$ was life changing for me certain weeks and I have never had a savings or excess money or familial help. My (ex)fiancé and I moved out here across the country for me to get this job and that cost me everything I had to take a gamble here. And I have since kicked her out. I found out she cheated on me two weeks before we left and called off our engagement. so right now, my total debt is roughly only 12k left on my car, 18k in student loans (even working 40 hours a week while doing college I still needed the money to help paying housing costs) and my rent out here where I live is 2300$ a month... So for the first time in my life. Especially now as a single man. I have what I would consider to be plenty of excess money at the end of the month. I have no prior savings, no real immediate danger debts other than those normal ones and walk away with roughly $5,000 at the end of every month after all bills (including fun things). And one thing I have never been taught once you reach this point is... What do you do with it? I feel weird just having it sit, and I feel like I need to be actively doing something? I have no one or anything to spend it on and instead of pulling the dumb kid move of buying a corvette for my quarter life crisis what do I do with it?

How to Train a Dog to be Less Aggressive Towards Small Animals,"I wasn't sure whether to flair this as behavior or training, but I have a 6 year old hound/boxer mix. I adopted him around a year ago not expecting to have another kind of animal in the house, as the reason he was given to the shelter is that he was killing his previous owner's chickens. However, I am planning on moving with my gf at the end of next summer, and she owns an 11 year old cat. Although neither of our pets are young, they're not old and neither have any major health issues, meaning that they'll need to be introduced to each other and be in the same house. I have read up on how to introduce cats and dogs, but since my dog has killed small animals in the past, I am unsure how he is going to take having a cat in the same house as him. He has not been anywhere near a cat since I adopted him, but I have seen him alert on small animals outside (armadillos/squirrels/etc) and I really can't imagine he will be any different towards a cat. Is there a good way to get him to stop being aggressive towards smaller animals before the move in? I'd rather avoid doing all the training when we're living together and try to start it beforehand.",1,1730237722.0
Advice on this stray!!!,"He’s extremely friendly and sweet. No food aggression, no growling, loves pets and scratches, stayed still for his bath even though he was scared, watched tv with me while I called my sister. He hasn’t left my side since bringing him home. His nails look clipped. This leads me all to believe he may have been someone’s pet, but I’m going off of cat rules, I don’t really know dog behaviour.
I checked him over for injuries. He has some missing patches of hair, but nothing he reacted to. Walks fine. Looks like he might have something up in his eyes but I’m not sure— I cleaned it up and he’s looked fine since. 
What worries me is that he flinches when i touch him. He is skeletal looking. I wish I could say I’m exaggerating. I had to feed him in increments because he was making himself sick from how fast he was eating the food I gave him. He was so cold when I found him. If he belongs to somebody, I’m worried he’s being harmed or neglected. I have owned dogs almost all of my childhood, but since moving out from my family home, I’ve only had cats. I can get everything he needs and I have a massive group of support who can take care of him while I work, but I’m wondering if he’d be in better hands if I surrender him. 
He’s a pitbull, and I’m so worried about what could happen to him. I’m trying not to get attached, but it’s hard when he’s laying on my chest and staring at me with those massive puppy dog eyes. The bastard. I also don’t want him to go back into the hands of a potential owner that was harming him. 
Anyways, this is all a long-winded way of asking for advice. 
What I need is advice on how to proceed with what to do with him. He just seems hungry and cold. If I hold onto him, what all is he gonna need? Like what toys are best for a dog? I know how to train a dog, thanks to my mom, but I’m lost on what enrichment he’d need. What’s the best food for dogs? Treats? Did I fuck up giving him hamburger buns?

Major relationship change with pups,"I have kind of a sad question... sorry for the long context 😕

Context: when I was younger, I was obsessed with dogs, I had books on books about everything you could know about every breed, I wanted to have a home with tons of land so I could have 100 dogs, I wanted to be an animal cop so I could rescue them, etc. Dogs gravitated towards me anywhere I went, even dogs who were typically very standoffish. I felt very connected with them. Around 11, I started to develop an auditory processing issue (probably always had it but it started to get very severe around this time due to intense life circumstances) that basically makes my brain associate certain sounds with panic and rage - sounds crazy but it's real. One of those sounds happened to be dogs licking...SO, I started to find that my love of dogs was clashing severely with the rage and panic I'd feel when I heard them licking, which of course is pretty often. As I grew up, it got so bad that I couldn't be friends with or date anyone who had a dog, wouldn't work in homes with dogs, I even had to drop a class in college because the teacher had a service dog. It's so awful, honestly. Changed the whole course of my life. For quite a while now, but within the last few years especially, dogs have really started to change with me - they seem wary of me, they act like I'm a threat or have negative energy. People often say to me 'my dog never behaves like this with anyone, what's wrong with you?!' So my question is... WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?! Do they sense the conflicting thoughts and feelings in my head about them? Do I subconsciously put out bad energy when I'm around them? Someone suggested I have a negative entity with me and maybe that's what they sense? I know I'll never be able to go back to having the kind of relationship with them as I once did, but I can't live with it if they're going to be scared of me for the rest of my life 😭😵 Any ideas??",1,1726483456.0
"I think I'm done for. Reading these posts, I realize I have nothing and may never catch up to my peers of the same age (33). As a recovering person, what can I do for basics? ","I'm 33, I'm 3 years sober and still struggling with the basics of maintaining a life.

When I left my bad job, I put my money into my bank savings, not a high interest savings

I am back to school and have a small business. That business, essentially makes net zero: enough to cover all my expenses and anything else in the year, but not enough to put away into a savings account. essentially I am unemployed.

I have 30k in my savings and 1.5k in checkings. no debts, no car or phone payments, 745 credit, all cards paid off on time. i live simple.

I have 3.5k floating around somewhere with ADP but I'm not sure how to access it because my previous manger put all my details in wrong on purpose so I can't access it.

I'll be honest, despite the above, I'm still in the basics of recovery despite it being 3 years. Some days I'm just glad my room is clean and I got 8 hours of sleep. The idea of opening up a bunch of investing accounts and playing the stock market sounds exhausting and counter productive (for now)

In my limited capacity, immediate surroundings, and core fundamentals. What can I do to create a ladder towards being more financial literate?

I was thinking of taking a financial literate class next semester.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, I appreciate everyone's comments, It was relieving to read these fresh POVs about my situation. It was re-assuring, hopeful, and provided clairvoyance on what I need to do next. I'm going to reference this thread and the wiki whenever I feel stuck. I realize, it is doing me no good to look at my peers, and i need to GTFO social media and just focus on what's happening on campus and in town. 

Everyone's input was realistic; small things I can set today to make huge changes for tomorrow.

Finding the most tax efficient way to inherit money.,"I have a traditional and Roth IRA BDA in my name from a non-spouse. From my understanding, I have 10 years to cash out of these accounts. My only plan is to add them to my retirement. I'm thinking about two different options:             

Max out a traditional 401K and lower my taxable income. I would then raise it back to where it was by removing money from the BDA accounts. This doesn't eliminate taxes, it only delays them.        

I could rip the band-aid off faster by removing BDA money till I get to the next tax bracket. I would pay income tax and then stick the money into a ROTH IRA and 401K.

Border Collie vs Samoyed,"Hello fellow dog lovers in r/dogs. I am a 24M in Malaysia looking to get a dog and I am leaning towards Border Collies and Samoyeds.

* **Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?** I had a family dog when I was young (\~7 years old), it was a mongrel that my family rescued. Not much training involved except potty training. Took care of her for a few years until she passed 2 years ago.
* **Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?** Primarily will be going through a breeder, but will opt to rescue if it's a good fit.
* **Describe your ideal dog.** My ideal dog will be a medium-sized dog with an active/semi-active lifestyle (couch potato sometimes). It should be friendly to strangers and other dogs. It needs to be manageable in a \~800 sqft apartment (I can dedicate a room/space for it). It cannot be overly loud since it’s an apartment.
* **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** Border Collie and Samoyed. Mainly due to their intelligence and activeness. Samoyeds in particular seem to fit the ""friendly"" part.
* **What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?** Basic tricks, perhaps some agility training and sports. Nothing too intense, playtime and walks in general.
* **Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g., agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g., hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?** No, but I’m willing to try if the breed needs it.

**Care Commitments**

* **How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?** I work from Monday to Wednesday; on these days it will be after work (5 PM - 10 PM or more). I work 10 AM - 4 PM. On other days (Thursday/Friday), I can commit more and full days on Saturday and Sunday.
* **How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?** Monday to Friday will be before and after work, probably 1-2 hours a day with a morning walk and evening walk. I can commit more hours on Thursday and Friday, but Malaysia is pretty hot during noon and afternoon. I have access to dog parks on Saturday and Sunday. There are also indoor dog playgrounds 15 minutes away.
* **How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?** Daily brushing is fine; I will pay someone to do it if needed.

**Personal Preferences**

* **What size dog are you looking for?** Medium-sized.
* **How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?** No excessive barking; can be vocal but can’t be too loud.
* **How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?** Not important.

Short term disability overpayment advice?,"Hello there! I've been going back and forth with my old job regarding this STD overpayment and I need advice on how to proceed. Not even sure this is the right place to ask but I just need general advice

For context I took short term disability back in march of this year. I wont go into detail.about my condition and due to my doctors going back and forth on whose responsibility it was to sign off on my paper work and I passed the timeframe to give them the medical information signed off by my doctor. Mind you my doctors aknowleged I was sick but no one wanted to sign off, they kept saying it was someone elses responsibility and even told me to get a new doctor to sign off. With all the back and forth I got denied and I did try appealing. I did not apply for FMLA because i was so overwhelmed with the back and forth with my doctors, and I feel dumb that I didn't do it but here I am. Finally end of June I got fired because of the denial and in September i got a notice that I owe over 2000 dollars for STD overpayment. Now I'm barely on my feet and I used all my saving to get be through my unemployment period (i didnt get unemployment because they said I didn't try hard enough to keep my, what a joke...). I barley got a new job but it doesn't pay nearly enough to pay it off. 

I did try calling my old employer (its ADP specifically), and asked if they can reduce my balance because it would cause me fincial strain to pay it off by the deadline they gave me which is  December 2024. They put in a request and I finally heard back in mid October and all they said is I'm welcome to go on a payment plan as long as its paid off in full by December. Now I deffinetly can't do that even if I worked non stop because I have rent and need to feed myself. I've tried calling again but I can't speak to anyone who directly handles the overpayments, they told me they just did emails and they put in a request to have someone contact me. I'm worried this will go to collections and ruin my credit because they just aren't getting back to me. What should I do? My mom says I should I just mail them a cashiers check with whatever I can pay every month that way they can't send me to collection but I have no clue if that would work.

Mind you everytime I try to contact them i never get an answer on payment plans or anything.

Any advice is greatly appreciated! Sorry for how long this is (':",0,1731812937.0

My dog is bored out of his mind,"I adopted a Maltese dog about little over a year ago. His previous owners threw him out and he was in a pretty rough shape, but now he’s doing ok health and nutrition wise. In the beginning he w
as pretty difficult and anxious and a very picky eater, which took a few months to resolve but now that everything is fine he seems bored all the time.

I suffer from depression myself and work from home so I don’t go out much. But I take him on a walk at least once a day and aside from that he doesn’t do any other activities. He is not interested in toys, does not like treats and does not like sitting idles next to me on the couch for more than 5 minutes. 

I don’t know what to do to entertain him. He just walks around the apartment all day. Sometimes when I’m playing on my PS he just walks around the room in circles. While I’m working he sleeps under my desk jumping up on my knees every now and then for some attention. 

It just breaks my heart to see him like that. To the point that I thought of giving him up for adoption but I’m afraid whoever takes him won’t be ok with his anxiety. Can someone give me advice? 

Ps: I live in Egypt and I don’t have the luxury of doggie day care :( 

TLDR: my dog is so bored he walks around in circles and I’m depressed and don’t take him out much 

Update: I walked my dog twice today, one 15 minute walk in the morning to do his business (that’s the one walk I mentioned earlier) and another longer walk just now (around 45 minutes) and that seemed to do the trick. I let him sniff around all he wanted and he even got to chase a stray cat and play with her, now he’s happily asleep on the couch. I have also ordered some toys that were suggested in the comments to see if they’ll work. 

I just wanna make it clear that I love the dog and definitely want to keep him. I try as hard as I can to not let my issues affect him and at some point feeding him and caring for him was the only reason I got out of bed. And now that I am doing a little better, I want to make his life a little better too which is why I asked for advice. 

Another concern that people had in the comments is that I don’t let him out to go to the bathroom enough times which is not healthy, I want to clarify that I have a designated bathroom for him in my apartment which he uses throughout the day, and then I clean it at the end of the day. So he’s definitely not holding his pee for extended periods of time. ",1,1727519690.0
Toughest soft toys? ,"Hey all! 

My boy Seymour is a shredder- he will go straight for seams on toys and go through them quickly. The cloth ones are his favorite- and while he has a few rubber balls he will play with he doesn’t like many other toys I’ve found that aren’t plush or softer things. 


What are your favorite brands for tough toys? I know shredding them is a lot of the fun for him but I can’t always replace his toys every other day. 😂😂😂

"How not to give up from this job, and how to prepare for an upcoming performance review?","I made a long post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1gwmsfd/got_an_unfair_criticism_from_my_supervisor_and_i/), and one person advised me to post it on this subreddit.

Long story slightly less long, I have been working in this company for three years now. It's not that well paid (it's below my country's average salary) nor do I feel respected, but it's probably good enough for now. There are some positive sides to it and maybe I want to stay a bit more and decide after. It's not too stressful and my supervisor and my boss are mostly nice to me. They don't track what I do all the time and I took it as trust between us.

However, recently it got more stressful and I do plenty of tasks. I would say that I do things from as basic as changing light bulbs, to some programming and data visualization. And so many things in between. Not to name it now, but we are a small team in charge of many properties, so it's natural. 

A few days ago I went to my supervisor to talk about something, and he asked me if I finished making some spreadsheets. I said I didn't, that I had plenty of things to do before. He laughed and said sarcastically ""Oh yeah, you are sooo busy"". I asked him ""Do you even know how much work I do here?"" and he replied ""No, what do you do?"". This got me sad and mad, and I told him that I am hurt and that I do quite a lot which many either don't know to do or don't want to do. He just said ""Well, we (him and the boss) planned to have a performance talk the next week anyway"". From his tone, it didn't sound like I can expect praise and promotion.

Now, I feel like I am not even sure if I want to prove myself to them, or if I want to list all the things I do during that talk. If my boss thinks the same as he does, it's obvious that they either don't know what I do, or think that it's not even that important. And it almost definitely means that I can forget about a raise and maybe any new benefits. The lack of structure in the company is obvious but I never cared as I thought that they are aware of my contribution. But it feels like that's not the case and if so, maybe I should slowly look for a new job.",0,1732466098.0
Is a Poodle a Good Fit?,"I love the personality of Golden’s but they wouldn’t be a good match for us due to their size, hair, and energy. I’m leaning heavily towards FCI Moyen Poodles (European Imported parents) due to their size, hair, and intelligence. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

	•	I’ve grown up with dogs and currently have a small terrier.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

	•	Would love to go through a breeder to avoid hidden temperament issues. I know temperament isn’t guaranteed with breeds, but rescues may need more work due to trauma.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

	•	A snuggly, quiet dog, who is equally excited to go for hikes as they are to spend time curled up next to me on the couch. A dog that’s good with all people and other dogs. Either a low prey drive so it doesn’t tug or get distracted on walks, or can be easily trained to ignore distractions. Our terrier currently has really high prey drive and doesn’t stop barking/pulling when it sees another animal. Would love it if the dog is calm in these circumstances. Bonus points if the dog is low shedding and likes to learn new tricks. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

	•	I’m open to suggestions! I’m leaning heavily towards FCI Moyen poodles since they don’t shed, are athletic enough to take on hikes, but have an off switch. They seem like the sweet spot in size since Standards are too big and Miniatures are a tad small.  I have always adored the personality of a golden retriever, but it’s hard to get past the thought of hair everywhere, their size, and their common health issues. If there was such a thing as a Golden Retriever with medium energy, better health, and little to no shedding I would get one in a heartbeat. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

	•	Basic obedience - heel, sit, and walk on a leash. Nothing crazy. It’d be really cool if the dog was able to ride in a trailer towed behind my bike. Would be great if the dog makes me feel like a genius, but not necessary.

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

	•	No intention on showing/sporting

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

	•	Around 2 hours a day. It will get 1 hour of walks, some play time, and lots of attention throughout the day. I WFH so the dog won’t be alone much.

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

	•	1 hour of walks each day and small bits of playtime. I’ll give the dog puzzles and other things so its brain will be stimulated. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

	•	Yes - can pay or do it myself. I’d be open to learning how to at home and if it doesn’t go as planned we can pay for grooming. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?
     
       20-40lbs

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

	•	All in moderation - I don’t mind a little of each, but would really like minimal amounts. I like the idea of a poodle since they don’t leave mounds of hair everywhere. I don’t mind some barking, but would love a relatively quiet dog. Alert barking is okay, but not a huge fan of barking in general. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

	•	Not important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
	•	 Snuggly dogs are the best - would love one that wants to sit next to me (or on me) and soak up all the pets. 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

	•	I would love one that’s eager to please

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

	•	It’d be great if the dog was relatively quiet when someone knocked on the door. An alert bark or two I wouldn’t mind, but I’m not a huge fan of loud incessant barking. I would love the dog to be friendly towards strangers. Either reserved but not anxious, or wagging its tail and walking up to them like they’re his best friend. Jumping would not be good - I have small nieces and nephews and elderly relatives that might get knocked over easily.

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

	•	That wouldn’t be ideal since we have a smaller terrier that’s getting older. I would love for the dog to either be indifferent to other dogs or friendly. Reactivity definitely makes a lot of things more difficult.

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

	•	Neuroticism
	•	Aggression
	•	Excessive barking
	•	Heavy Leash pulling

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

	•	I work from home so the dog won’t be left alone for more than a few hours each week. Might be gone for 4-5 hours 2-3 times a week, but aside from that my wife or I will be home. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

	•	Wife and I will tag team walking, training, and feeding the dog. My wife prefers a dog that she can manage on walks (she’s tiny)
	•	My wife loves the looks of Poodles in a Teddy Bear cut

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

	•	We have a small 12lb Norfolk Terrier. She’s good with other dogs and people, but is reserved if a dog wants to play with her. 

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

	•	Yes, we have family with young kids and a plan to have our own in the future

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

	•	We rent an apartment - not sure on policy since we are moving

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

	•	not aware of bans on dogs where we live

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: 75-95 degrees F in the summer
Winter is between 40 and 70 F

**Additional Information and Questions**

25)	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.


26)	Feel free to ask any questions below.

	•	If an American breeder has imported FCI Moyen Poodles as Sire and Dam, is the breeder still seen as reputable? 
	•	Are there any breeds I should also be aware of?

2nd car thinking of leasing.,"lots of negative talk on leasing cars in general as a   main form of transpo. im looking at a second vehicle, my main is a lexus is350 and i dont plan on getting rid of it ever. i wanted a truck for the winter and for doing things that my tiny sedan just doesnt have room for. the leased truck would barely be driven, so the 10,000 mile lease wont be a problem. in this case is a lease a better idea, especcially with the super high intrest. and finacing a truck new or used will run me like 800-1300. which is not happening.

pardon spelling and grammar im lazy

How should I introduce my 3 yo F dog to a 1yo F foster ,"Hello! My husband and I have a 3 yo female husky/Malinois mix at home. We recently found a 1yo female dog in the shelter who is not doing well in the shelter (very terrified of people, but curious about other dogs) who ironically looks identical to our dog at home. We don’t have the heart to leave her in the shelter sad and alone so we decided to foster her. We are supposed to meet her/pick her up today. My question is—how and when should we introduce them? They are both fixed and our dog at home gets along with most dogs (unless a dog instigates a fight, then she will fight back). Should we keep them separate for a couple days to allow the foster to adjust? Once we do introductions I know our dog will run up to the foster and immediately try to play but I am afraid the foster might be so scared she’ll snap. I know that once female dogs fight once, they tend to hold grudges and always fight to the death and I do not want that to happen. I just ultimately want the foster to feel comfortable and hopefully learn to love our dog so we can potentially adopt her.

If I dedicate literally every extra dollar outside my budget and cost of living to paying off my student loans, I could kill them within six months.

Saving for college or a future home and retirement?,"My kids are growing up fast and we have been investing on their behalf. I am looking down the road and it's clear that it is much easier to get a loan for college than a mortgage. Loans for college are also generally low interest. There shouldn't be a need to pay them off right away, and they can be deferred if the student is in a graduate program. That said, many families seek to pay tuition upfront or pay off the loans asap. 

I imagine my kids going to a 4 year college and following up with graduate school. This means that they wouldn't be in the job market until they are nearly 30 and they wouldn't need to start making payments on their loans until then. In the meantime, I can continue to invest on their behalf, growing their $15k accounts to $150k by that time. 

They will emerge on the job market with $150k that will help buffer their transition to work-life. They can buy a house - at least here in the Midwest - and start building equity asap. Sure, they will still have loan payments, and mortgage payments, but they will also have a nest egg that is growing at 8% interest that will compete against their 3% student loan. It will also allow me to keep principal in the market instead of the school's bank account. 

I'll have more money to help my kids out in their 30's and beyond. In the end, it seems like we should hold our money in the market as long as possible and let our kids pursue whatever education they want, preferably deferring payment while in graduate school so they can maximize their earnings in their professional life.

Hopefully the software could also attempt to automatically categorize transactions, as I recall Mint used to do, perhaps improving over time based on my previous manual categorizations.

I tried YNAB for a few days but it seemed a bit difficult/too much for me at this point. I think I am focused more on tracking spending as opposed to a ""zero based"" budget currently.

I'm just hoping to find a solution that's easier than doing this all in Excel. More than willing to pay for it. Also would rather pay than have an app make its money by selling my info/advertising.

From a nerdwallet article I just read, I thought Empower or Pocketguard might be worth checking out. Any other thoughts/recommendations?",0,1731616387.0
My girl turns 10 years old next month. How can I make sure her “golden years” are the best ever? ,"My sweet mixed breed girl (great pyr and some sort of shepherd and idk what else) turns 10 years old next month. She is in great health and has a pesky two year old brother keeping her young. 

The last couple of years have been stressful for me and full of lots of change for her. We’re in a more stable place now and I want to make sure that she lives the best possible life she can have until she leaves me, which I hope is quite a long time from now. 

She has been my loyal companion and I owe her my entire life. What are some ways you’d recommend to make her feel happy and content? 

I take her for a couple of walks per day and she loves playing with her brother. I also work from home so she’s by my side nearly 24/7. 

Thank you in advance! ",1,1726541313.0

7 month old puppy getting bullied at dog parks,"Hello everyone, I’m looking for some insight or advice. I have a 7 month old bernedoodle puppy. She’s about 50 pounds, very sweet, playful, high energy and submissive. When we go to the dog park, she loves to run, chase, and wrestle, but about half the time we are there adult dogs are constantly bullying and attacking her. She’s not trying to play with them. They are finding her. I would understand if she’s being annoying puppy and they’re telling her to stop, but they are actively chasing her, biting her hunches and her neck, growling and pinning her down. She gets scared and submissive but they continue to attack her and chase her. The owners of the dogs always swear that never happened before and they’re surprised their dog is behaving that way. I would love some insight into why this could be happening. She is not spayed yet, but has not shown any signs of going into heat. I can’t think of any other reason why she gets singled out and attacked so much. I know dog parks aren’t recommended for puppies but at seven months I felt like she’s old enough to go. She has so much energy and the dog park is such a good way to run her, so would love to be aware of things that I can do or look for while we’re there to prevent anything bad from happening. So any dogs psychologists out there that could enlighten me in anyway I would appreciate it. 🐶🥺🐾

How Can We Secure Our Retirement Future in the U.S.? Advice Needed for a Family That Moved from China,"
Hello everyone, my family and I recently moved from China to Indiana, USA. My wife and I have two children, aged 12 and 10. My wife stays at home to take care of the children, and I continue to work in China, earning roughly $300,000 per year. Since we do not have employment in the U.S., we don’t have access to 401(k) plans or other typical retirement options here.

Given our situation, we are looking for advice on how to effectively plan for our retirement. We would appreciate any insights on investment strategies, tax planning, insurance, or other approaches that can help us secure a stable future.

Managers dog dislikes me,"One of my managers has a roughly 1 year old female german shepherd. He got her as a puppy and would bring her to work almost every day where I would play with and pet her a few minutes every time she was there, she never showed any signs of fear or aggression toward me and was really sweet while really young. Probably 5 or 6 months ago now the dog would start barking at me, tensing up and retreating when I was around. A few months ago she got spayed and after she recovered and started coming in again it’s even more fearful/aggressive than before, although sometimes she is completely docile and comes up to me for pets and to play. 

Today after she came up to me I pet her for maybe 15 seconds max then she walked away and I went to leave the office and she fully lunged at me like she was going to bite. It sucks because I absolutely love dogs, i’ve never done anything purposely or accidentally that would hurt or scare her in any way I can think of. I’m actually starting to be afraid of the dog and am going to avoid contact because I think I am going to get bitten eventually if I keep interacting.

[Discussion] Does anyone else have a couch potato? I think we adopted a cat,"We have had our rescue for a little under 10 months now and affectionately call her a 'cat-dog'. She is 2 years old. All she wants to do is sleep in her little bed and get belly rubs and cuddles. She can sleep 20h a day if we let her. Hates walks (we rescued her from a rural rescue and is scared of our city neighborhood, we are working on this with a behavioral vet. She LOVES the nature park though which we take her on weekends). Doesn't like or know how to play with toys. Doesn't bark, no separation anxiety, is very self-reliant. Just wants to sleep and get cuddles. Afraid of strangers and happy to stay in her room when we have guests over, maybe she is a bit curious but won't approach. She is excited in the morning and when we come home but that is about it. She enjoyed learning new tricks with treats but gets bored after a few minutes. Does anyone else have a similar dog?

My dad generally doesn’t like most small dogs, he cannot stand the aggressive and defensive manor of most of them. He often talks about wishing he could find a small dog that would love him unconditionally as well as being friendly with others. 
Small fluffy dogs are a very hard no because my lab/pit was attacked by a flock of off leash yorkies as a puppy and now he is extremely defensive and aggressive with them (the only time he’s ever that way). He is extremely friendly with other small dogs as long as they don’t resemble a yorkie. 
This dog would be very babied, and coddled. Spend 90% of its time inside unless it’s ideal weather outside. He really just wants a cuddler.  
He used to have a dachshund mix that was his sweetheart, she passed away 3 years ago and he’s missed her ever since. He just got through cancer this year and he’s been quite the depressed homebody since then, which has made him miss her much more. 
Oh ya, he doesn’t like pugs.

Question Regarding Income Needed for Retirement ,"Hey all. Wanted to get your thoughts on an investment question I’ve been considering.

I’m trying to determine my retirement “number” and have been deliberating on the percent of my pre retirement income I should be using for my calculations.

I know the standard consideration is to cover between 70 and 80 percent of your pre retirement income. However I’m wondering if this is excessive in my case (and maybe others on this thread as well).

For instance, I contribute 15% of my gross income to Roth IRA’s and an HSA currently. So once retired my monthly expenditures should decrease by 15%

Also, I’ll have my house paid off in retirement. My mortgage constitutes about 22% of my gross income. Assuming I won’t have this expense in retirement this should decrease my needed income by approx 22%. I’m aware I’ll still have maintenance fees, home insurance, and property taxes.

And finally my wife and I plan to fund our retirement with Roth IRAs. With an HSA for medical expenses that will likely increase in retirement. Currently we spend about 15% of our gross income on federal and state taxes. We wouldn’t pay anything in taxes if we utilize Roth IRAs for our retirement funding, as well as an HSA for medical expenses. 

So based on these figures , I should only need around 55% of my pre retirement income correct? Do my calculations sound correct?

I want to plan accordingly but also don’t want to save so much that we don’t use some money for enjoying life occasionally making fun memories with our kids. 

Thank you all!

I have some questions as a first time puppy owner (long post),"So im a teen, i live in a smallish house (this info will later make sense) and about 4 days ago i got my first puppy who is 2 months old. Ive been having some ups and downs related to them and thats why i made this post.

Also i apologize if the flair is wrong, there werent any question related flairs!

For a starter, i share 2 cats and a bunny whos mainly in a large cage, and ive decided with my mother (who has trained 2 dogs before) that letting the pup be in my room only at the moment. Me and my mum share a room, im on a bigger proper bed and shes on an air matress, all of the time the puppy can free roam in my room, we cant really potty train the pup at the moment as its pretty cold outside, and we tried to take her for a walk outside 3 days ago, but the puppy was too interested in the surroundings and ended up being pretty cold and shivering so we took her inside and wrapped her in a blanket. We dont have any jackets for the pup at the moment but are planning to. So far we havent let her outside anymore and decided to start potty training next week as im going to be home alone this weekend (at the moment the puppy does all their business rly nicely on those pads that go on the floor)

The question with that is, any tips for going outside with this weather? And how to teach them to do it only outside as we cant be outside for more than 5 minutes to avoid her starting to shiver from the cold.

Currently our routine is waking up at around 10am, cuddling/napping until 12pm, food at 12pm, calmly the first 60 minutes to be sure their stomach doesent get twisted, then playtime as much as they want until 3pm, around 3pm is next feeding, calmly, playfully and then napping until 9pm, ood, and then sleep time. Currently the puppy sleeps with my mum in her bed at night and at cuddling or napping time in the morning shes with me in my mums bed. 

Here is where i really need help, how do i get her not so attached to me? If im outside of my room for 10 secs or more shell start whining and scratching at the door, the only time that doesent happen is if shes occupied aka with my mother in the room. We cant really let her roam in the other rooms beacause of the cats, we dont know how theyll get along (yes im aware of a house line, but my mums not so sure on using it), and the other rooms are not puppy proofed (we have alot of stuff so its hard to puppy proof, we dont have alot of cabinets or storage spots)

Random note: my room is fully puppy proof, wide range of toys, no cages or pens as we had a pen until yesterday beacause it didnt have a good affect on the pup, causing her stress and big seperation anxiety (even if she was right next to my bed with it), could hardly get her to calm down in it if she was awake. And she doesent only get fed the food from those plastic packets, also kibble every time the bowl gets empty as she doesent eat it as much.

And thats about it! It was a long post as i put all the possible details. If you have any questions, tips, answers, tell them in the comments please!",1,1731606282.0

Dachshund or Golden Retriever? Or something different altogether?,"Hi everyone!

Need suggestions for a destructive dog,"My husband has a lab that is a little over 2 years old.  My husband is retired so they spend a fair amount of time together.

That said, he is very destructive. He ate through the cable mechanisms that open his camper shell door!!  He digs holes, he tears up things he shouldn't get a hold of (like a package of washcloths) and so much more.  He isn't even the size of a normal lab...he is quite a bit smaller.  SO much destruction in something so small!!

That said, I did do some research.  I am almost 100% confident that Miles has separation anxiety if he can't be allowed to go with my husband.  I also know that as smart as he is, he is getting bored and the destructive behavior is to alleviate this boredom.

My husband is a bit old-fashioned and just doesn't understand dog behavior.  Dogs are to be quiet and obedient.  He has gotten softer in his old age and he allows Miles to do more than his previous labs ever did.  He is what some would say, SPOILED...LOL!

I suggested to my husband that we get him some enrichment toys to help with the boredom when he has to be left for any length of time.  I am familiar with Kong brand toys and we are going to get a couple of those. (I also have a deaf land seal named Casper.  Can't leave my baby out!)

What suggestions would you recommend for something durable yet challenging?  I want something safe for him that he, hopefully, can't destroy and also be a challenge.

Help!  Dog ran through our electric fence.,"Hello everyone.  Okay, we have an electric fence around our yard.  Dog was great for months.  Then the collar stopped working for a bit and then he started leaving.

He only leaves our house on the driveway, seems to take the hit and move on.  Anywhere else in yard he won’t go through, even to come back home.  He has to walk on driveway.

How can I get him to realize the driveway is not a gateway to freedom any longer?

Breed Recommendations for First Time Owner,"\*\*Introduction\*\*

Hello everyone I will be moving to Arizona soon and are wanting to get a dog in a couple months. It would have to be hypoallergenic since I do have a small allergy to dogs.

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* It will be my first dog. My wife had a few dogs growing up.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

\* I do not think starting with a puppy is a good idea so adopting a rescue would be my preference.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

\* A chill dog that can either be satisfied by being in the back yard or relaxing inside, is good around kids and can be left home while I am at work. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* I have been looking at like Maltese, shih tzu, bichon frise, Havanese, but am open to other types. Hypoallergenic is my biggest want in a dog. (Yes I know they aren't fully hypoallergenic but they aren't as bad).

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* The standard sit, stay, wait, place, and recall.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* A few hours before work and after work depending on my schedule.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* A 30-60 min walk. Dog park possibly I am unsure if there is one around us (I would assume so).

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* We would be able to brush a few times a week depending on the type of dog. For the rest I would leave to a groomer.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

\* I personally like smaller lap dogs, but my wife is more of a medium sized dog so either or works. We do have a doggy door in our bedroom so preferably small enough to fit through it to go outside when ever it wants.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* Very little to no shedding, barking is ok but would prefer little, and no slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Not that important

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* Eager-to-please

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* Barking is ok when someone is at the door just calm down when we answer it. Over all calm if I am calm when meeting strangers. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Overall no aggression specifically to children as I will have a baby.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* Could be up to 8 hours, but may not be that long all the time. This will only be during the week.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* Either same level or even more care for the dog as she is more experienced taking care of them.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* No

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* Yes

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Should I adopt one big dog or two small dogs?,"I have a small house, with an enclosed garden, opposite a small park and a 5 minute drive from several very large green open spaces. I’m a single parent to a 2 year old and a 12 year old. When my 12 year old was much younger we had a cavalier king charles spaniel, but my youngest has never lived with a dog before. We don’t have any pets at the moment. I work from home most of the time, but generally go into the office for an 8 hour day once a week (occasionally twice in a week). I spend an hour each day walking the school run, and I have time for extra walks on days I work from home.

Earlier this year I decided I finally have the time and energy for a dog, and my oldest really wants a golden retriever. I think they’re lovely dogs, and I’ve been keeping an eye on the local rescues to see if an adult/senior golden comes up for adoption. I’ve never had a large dog before, but I like the idea of big dog cuddles! 

Recently I’ve noticed several bonded pairs of smaller dogs coming up for adoption, and I’m wondering if that would be a better idea? I already have a small dog flap in the back door, which gave my ckcs free access to the garden for toileting while I was out of the house. A golden would be too big to use the flap, and a bigger flap isn’t an option. Also, as happy as my last dog was, he was a very social little guy, and was never happier than when interacting with other dogs. I think he would have loved to have a companion, especially sleeping downstairs overnight, or while I’m out for a few hours. 

Having never had a big dog, or a pair of small dogs before, I’d really appreciate any opinions more experienced dog owners could give me? What would you do in my position? I won’t be going for a puppy/puppies either way - that is way too much work for me with a toddler at home!",1,1726946340.0
How do I brush my dog's teeth without betraying his trust?,"I hate having to do this to him and he hates it too.  When he sees the tooth brush he goes and hides.   So my only choice is to catch him off guard.  Lately my routine has been sitting on the carpet, playing with him for a bit, and then picking him up and brushing his teeth.

He's on to that as well, because just now I sat down next to him while he was sleeping (with no intention of brushing his teeth), he woke up and saw me and started this reverse sneezing which he only does when he's severely stressed.  It just breaks my heart.

First time getting a used car loan. With 4k down payment what price range should I look for?,"I’m 28 years old and I’ve only ever bought used cars and paid cash. I’ve had several cars because I used to do a lot of traveling so I would sell them whenever I would go on a long trip. I always get them checked by a mechanic and bought cars anywhere from 2k to 6k but I’ve had some good purchases and some that crapped out on me way too soon. I know that cash is the best way to buy used but I’m tired of driving clunkers. If my fiance and I are going to split the car and have 4k for a down payment what price range should we look for. We are both self employed so income varies from month to month. Over the past year I’ve averaged about 4k a month and she’s averaged about 6.5k. My credit score is 700 and hers is around 720. I want a nice, comfortable, reliable car but don’t want to bite off more than we can chew. I found a 2021 Kia seltos with 60k miles for $14,668. I haven’t applied for any loans yet but assuming we can get one with <6% apr is that a reasonable purchase? Is a 4k down payment enough to buy a new car in the low 20k range? If so is that the better option because of low apr and the fact that it’s new? I’m new to this stuff so any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you!

Edit: I will add some more info since the people are asking. I’m normally very financially responsible and have never had any debt. Until last year. Quitting my job, transitioning to being self-employed, and just being financially irresponsible in the beginning of our relationship put myself in about 9k of debt. She did not used to be financially responsible but we have both gotten it together this year. I brought my credit card debt down to 2k and she has none. Our monthly expenses are $1500 for rent, $150 cell phone bill, around $110 per month for car insurance, around $450 for food. To clarify, if we were to combine our finances (debt and savings) we would have about 9k. I just didn’t want to spend most of it on a down payment. And ideally we would split the car 50/50 but I’m open to suggestions. Waiting to save up more for the down payment is not an option as my last car crapped out on me and we do not live in a place that is walkable or has good public transportation. We go up to NJ from Florida for Christmas every year and I need a car that can do that reliably. My car broke down on the trip last year in the mountains and it consumed half our trip and I’d like to avoid that this year. ",0,1732349904.0

Does it make sense to move in this scenario?,"
My partner and I live in Tampa (a M/HCOL area) in a 3/2 single-family home we rent for $1740/month base rent, around $2050 with utilities. Our landlord raised our renewal rate to $2000 base/$2300 with utilities, but when we said we wouldn’t renew, they dropped it back down to $1700 base rent. We have a deadline to decide whether to sign the renewal.  

We found a new rental, a 2/1 that’s half the space but significantly cheaper: $1300/month or $1400/month with January rent free. The issue is the new lease starts December 15th, and they won’t push back the start date. They also require first month’s rent, a security deposit, and a pet fee upfront—$3000 total.  

Our current lease ends January 28th, and since we paid first/last/security when we moved in, January would technically be free, but we’d still owe full rent for December. With no savings, paying rent on both places for December isn’t feasible.  

The new rental would save us $700+ a month, which is huge, and other 2/1 rentals in the area cost much more. However, we’d need to downsize quickly, and our current 3/2 is a great deal for the location.  

For context:
- I net $4000/month and gross $75,000/year.
- My partner makes $3700/month base but earns overtime regularly.  He makes around $50,000 a year.
- We hope to save for a house within a year or so.  

Should we stay in our current rental or move to the smaller, cheaper place? ",0,1732122756.0

Parents (early 60s) have an excessive amount of cash in savings,"My parents never learned how to invest besides diligently contributing to their company 401ks. They've always been good at saving money, but I've just recently learned how much they actually keep in cash in a standard bank savings account.

I've always suggested they open IRAs when they were younger, but they were comfortable just contributing to their 401ks and keeping the rest of their savings.

To simplify things, they have about 1.8m in their 401ks combined but have about 370,000 in the savings account earning little to no interest. Now, they're asking me for suggestions on where to park the cash as they near retirement.

I really don't even know what to suggest for such a large amount. My initial thoughts are to just put everything in a total market index fund in an IRA + brokerage account, but seeing as how they got to this point by being risk averse and unwilling to learn about investing, I don't want them to see their cash savings suddenly drop in value should the market take a downturn.

An alternative would be a HYSA or something like SNSXX (they live in a state with high taxes) so they can at least get a 4.49% yield as fixed income every month while keeping the amount essentially as liquid as cash.

What's the best route to suggest for them if they plan to retire in a few years? They have no debt but they don't own a home. They rent a house right now since they plan to move closer to my brother to be near the grandkids in retirement. That state will have high taxes as well, if that matters.",0,1732388364.0
Trying to figure out how to survive on one income,"(29F) Posting here because hopefully someone reading this has been in my situation and can offer up advice.

About 2 months ago, my husband (27m) lost his job. In that time, he was able to find a good paying job, but they let him go after a week, because he missed one day for a doctor’s appointment. 

He has been tirelessly searching for a job, but the bills don’t stop. The places I’ve called have been willing to work with us, but it’s just been an endless cycle of pushing back bills and playing catch up. 

We’re in the situation now where all our money is going towards catching up on bills. After paying everything due, we’re left with only $50 to feed ourselves and buy gas for two weeks. 

One tank of gas lasts me a week only commuting to work, and that alone is $60 to fill up the tank. (Oh, and the check engine light is on as well, but I know I can’t afford to fix it)

We were already living paycheck to paycheck, so we have no savings at the moment. My credit score is around 600, so it’s too low to open a credit card or obtain a personal loan. 

My husband filed for unemployment when he lost his job but they haven’t processed his claim, and attempts to contact them have resulted in the runaround. 

I’m salaried and my job has pretty long hours, so finding another job for me is hard to work around my schedule. I’ve tried looking for something higher paying but I work in a specialized field (journalism/graphic design) and higher paying jobs that utilize my skill set are scarce in my area. 

I’m about thisclose to starting a gofundme or asking for help on Facebook.

Long term, I know I want to build up my credit score to buy a house, have a healthy emergency fund and save up for retirement, but it’s hard to think about years down the road when I’m too broke to afford groceries.

Crunch/crackle toys for a small super chewer?,"I have a Yorkie that LOVES crunching and crackling. He goes nuts for water bottles.

I need to retire now! Should I pay off my mortgage with my 457 account?,"Throw away account - Im 62 and I have got to get out of this place and retire before I go nuts! I have a mortgage of $2000 a month. I have 10 more years of payments left.  I currently get retirement checks from 2 additional sources, I will get a retirement check from my current job and I will apply for SS benefits. With all those funds combined I will be taking home around $1500 less a month than I currently am if I keep paying my mortgage. That would make things kinda tight for me. I really dont want to have to give up anything I currently do. I have enough in my 457 account that I can cash out when I leave this job that will let me pay off my mortgage. Granted I will still have to set aside about $500 a month to pay property taxes/insurance so I will still be bringing in about the same money/month I am now. I have other retirement funds as well and my house would be paid off so I think it would bring me some peace not having to come into this hell hole anymore. What am i missing or what are things I should consider before heading down this route?

  
INFO UPDATE:

  
My interest rate is 3.25%. I actually have 8 years left on my mortgage.

  
I do have other investment accounts available. (approx 250k)

  
To answer a question: If I quit tomorrow I will be down $4000 a month until I can get SS started.

One great answer I saw here that I think is the way to go (thats why I love this place) is continuing to pay the monthly mortgage with monthly withdrawals from my 457. Never thought of that!

Our income prevents my wife and I from directly contributing to a Roth IRA. I am completely aware that the Backdoor Roth is a possible solution. 

That being said, we are currently contributing around $4K per MONTH into an after-tax brokerage account in addition to my traditional 401k. Basically, much more than the $7K annual Roth IRA limit. 

Most of the brokerage investments are dividend ETFs, REITs, income focused investments, etc with the goal being early retirement and passive monthly income. 

I realize that the brokerage account is less tax efficient, however, I am willing to pay more in taxes and invest a lot more money in my brokerage account if it means I can access my money whenever I want and have no restrictions placed on my money by Uncle Sam. I don’t want everything tied up in a retirement account. 

Ultimately, does my aggressiveness with my investment amount in my brokerage account outweigh the tax-free growth potential of the Roth? ",0,1731708691.0
401k + Simple IRA rollover within the same year?,"I have a question about rollover limitations. I have a couple of retirement accounts at different institutions from old jobs and I'm looking to consolidate them into one place. I have a Simple IRA account at one place, and a traditional 401k at another. I'm looking to roll both of them into a rollover IRA account I have at Vanguard (and will move that to my Roth IRA eventually). My question is, I know there are limits no more than 1 401k indirect rollover per calendar year, but would this apply in my situation with an IRA and a 401k? Is there any way I can still do this or should I just do one now, and wait another year to do another? Happy to clarify anything else because I know this is a uniquely weird situation",0,1731778981.0

Advice on Getting the Best Lease Deal for a 3rd Row SUV (Currently Have a 2023 Mazda CX-9 to Trade),"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice on how to get the best lease deal for a 3rd row SUV. Here’s my situation:

* **Current Vehicle:** 2023 Mazda CX-9 with \~22,000 miles and 4 remaining payments of $350 each.
* **What We’re Looking For:**
   * A lease for a 3rd row SUV (Mazda CX-90 is an option, but we’re open to other models).
   * 12,000 miles per year.
   * Flexible on lease term (24, 36, or 48 months).
   * Budget: Under $450/month with as little money down as possible (inclusive of taxes).
* **Location:** Philadelphia, PA (19125).

What’s the best approach to negotiate this type of lease? Should I try to roll in the remaining payments on the CX-9 or trade it in to cover part of the costs? Are there other 3rd row SUVs I should consider for this budget?

Also, if anyone has experience with leasing in Philadelphia or tips specific to negotiating taxes/fees here, I’d really appreciate it!

"Laid off early this year, 401k balance sent to PenChecks. Can I still roll it over to an IRA? What's the best use?","Hello,

Earlier this year I got laid off from my work, and they sent my 401k balance to PenChecks recently. It wasn only sub 5k since i didn't personally contribute to my 401k, and Penchecks didn't automatically roll it over to an IRA. They said they have the check waiting for me.

I was wondering if I could still put this check into a rollover IRA? Or is it too late?

If still possible, can I contribute to the rollover IRA since I had income for the first couple of months of this year?

Paying Off House #1 now or bigger down payment for #2 - Moving in 3-5 Years,"Hello - I'm looking to see how others have approached this topic, as I've tried finding answers and haven't found something specific to my scenario.

How long did it take for your dog to adjust to a new apartment?,"Hello! I recently moved into a new apartment with my dog (8 year old standard poodle) and he seems to be having some trouble settling in. It's been a little under 2 weeks and while he is fine when I'm home, he cries and barks a lot when I am not there. 

You would think this would be a sign of separation anxiety but in my previous home, he's had no issues being by himself. I usually don't leave him alone for more than 5 hours a day anyways. I don't want this moving experience to develop into separation anxiety for him. 

I know adjusting will take time and my dog is a bit sensitive to new noises. When we first moved in, every noise would set him off. Now, he seems more tolerant to neighbor-related noise. The only noises he doesn't like is when people walk too close to my front door or stomp down the stairs. 

I have been providing lots of physical and mental stimulation- walking 1 hour off leash/long-line in the morning, multiple slow sniffing potty breaks throughout the day, games/puzzles, etc.- but he still seems to be having a hard time. He doesn't sleep/settle when I leave for the day. My dog also isn't very food or toy motivated, so training him has always been hard.

I'd appreciate any advice or criticism from fellow dog owners! How long did your dog take to adjust? Any tips on how to help my dog settle in more comfortably? Thanks in advance!",1,1728261975.0

"Is it better to pay off a lower interest card completely, or take a big chunk out of a higher interest card?","Edit: Thanks so much everyone, I think I have a plan!

I'll work on Card 2, and pay 1k per month for the next three months.  That way I'm making good progress, and still have some cash on hand for emergencies to get through the winter.  Hopefully by then I'll have enough scraped up to get the rest of the balance paid off fairly quickly.  I'm also going to shop around for balance transfer offers, especially for Card 3.

Fingers crossed no disaster is looming that throws a wrench in my plan.

-----
I have three cards that I'm carrying a balance on. (My credit score is around 750 atm) I'm mostly only able to pay minimums each month (ugh), but I try to do more when I can.  I have saved up almost 3k, and am considering paying off one card, or paying most of another.  What would be best? I'm looking to keep my remaining minimums as low as possible.

Card 1: 20.99%, balance about 2700 (credit limit 3200)

Card 2: 27.99%, balance about 4200 (credit limit 7000)

Card 3: 27.99%, balance about 6700 (credit limit 7000)

I have a fourth card that I pay off every month, usually about 20.00 per month in charges (subscriptions, mainly) Credit limit 11,460

And a fifth card with no balance and 11000 in available credit.

I considered trying to get a no/low interest balance transfer--at least for card 3, but I'm worried that I'll only be approved for part of the total.

Retirement Savings Sanity Check: Am I Overdoing It?,"I'm 29, single, and make a good living (160-180k pre-tax). I've been laser-focused on saving for an early retirement at 50, but lately, I've been wondering if I'm going overboard and sacrificing my current happiness.

Here's the situation:

* Income: 160-180k per year
* Retirement Savings:
* Maxed out 401k with a 5% match
* Pension that will pay ~4.5k/month
* Government pension ~500/month
* Estimated Social Security: 2k/month
* Currently have ~1.4 million in retirement accounts
* Other Savings: Maxing out HSA
* Expenses: Living with parents, no debt (no car, house, student loans)
* Location: Midwest, medium-high cost of living

The Dilemma:

I'm itching to move out, buy a house (around 500k), and get a new car (around 60k).  Ideally, I'd like to relocate and eventually get married, but honestly, I feel stuck.  I'm unhappy living with my parents, but I'm hesitant to make changes that could significantly impact my early retirement plans.

My Questions:

Am I sacrificing too much of my present for the future?
Should I loosen the reins on my savings and start living a little more?

Chihuahua? Toy poodle? Need help picking a breed!,"\*\* Hey everyone! I’m looking to get a puppy in the next yearish and I’m totally overstressing about what breed to choose lol. I grew up around a dog that had a lot of issues and it caused a lot of stress and heartache so I’m just feeling really strongly about making sure I get a well bred and good tempered dog. Any advice from y'all would be so appreciated! \*\*



1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?



\* I grew up around a dog but this will be my first time owning a dog and being responsible for it. I’m familiar with dogs and dog training.



2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?



\* Definitely want to go through a reputable breeder. It’s really important to me to get a dog that is predictable.



3)	Describe your ideal dog.



\* I want a very small, friendly lap dog. I want a dog that will snuggle with me and sleep in my bed. I want it to be cool with lots of walks and can come with me everywhere. I want it to be friendly towards people and at least neutral around other dogs. I definitely want a girl dog. I have a 1 year old cat who is my first priority since she’s already here, so I want to be careful to do whatever I can to make living with a dog easy for her and not lower her quality of life.



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



\* I have really fallen in love with long haired chihuahuas. I love how tiny and portable they are and I think they are super cute. I know looks aren’t the most important thing when choosing a breed but I can’t help but care somewhat lol, as much as I hate to admit that. I’m a little concerned about the temperament of chihuahuas though. I’m seeing a lot of conflicting info online…some saying they are super sweet and friendly and others saying they are one person dogs and don’t like strangers. I have also taken toy poodles into consideration, but I don’t love their look as much (I know, I shouldn't care) and I’m not sure I’m up for the grooming. I would definitely be keeping it in a short cut. Papillons are another on my list but I’m worried they might be a little too sporty and high energy for me. I went back and forth on cavaliers but ultimately decided the health problems are not worth it for me with them. Breeds like Shi-Tzu's and Maltese seem to have the right temperament but again, the grooming, and I'm also not crazy about how they look 😬.



5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?



\* Pretty much just basic obedience and manners. Maybe some tricks for fun.



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?



\* No.



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?



\* Like 4+ hours? I work in the late afternoons through evening so I’m home more than not. 



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  



\* I could probably do an hour or so. No dog parks. Planning on doing lots of walks and play time indoor and outdoor. Maybe an easy hike here and there.



9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?



\* I’m fine with brushing everyday. I’d rather not get a breed that requires full haircuts. I don’t really want to take on that additional cost of paying a groomer if I can avoid it. I don’t know how good I would be at doing that myself lol. I’m totally fine with regular baths and brushing, trimming nails, etc.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*



10)	What size dog are you looking for?



\* Small. Think purse dog lol.



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



\* A minimal to moderate amount of shedding is fine. I already have a cat so I’m used to that. I don’t want like husky level shedding though lol. I’m okay with reasonable barking like barking at the door. I’d prefer they not be barking constantly for no reason. Minimal slobber, please.



12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



\* It would be nice to be able to but it’s not a big deal for me. I'm fine with using a long line instead.



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



\* Very snuggly!!!



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?



\* Eager to please



15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  



\* I don’t really mind if they bark when someone knocks or approaches the house. I want them to be friendly with people. They don’t have to be best friends with everyone but I want them to be very okay with people.



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?



\* They don’t need to love playing with other dogs but they need to be neutral around them. I’m definitely trying to avoid aggression of any kind.



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



\* Aggression towards people and my cat are big ones for me.



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



\* There is almost always someone home, so not very often at all. At the most, 4-5 hours.



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 



\* I live with family who wouldn’t care too much as long as the dog wasn’t large or super disruptive. I would be the caretaker of the dog but my mom would be happy to help with potty breaks and stuff if I was out and needed her to. She could also pet sit if I was gone overnight but I would prefer to just bring the dog with me.



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



\* I have a young adult cat. She is curious and playful.



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



\* No kids in the house right now but I hope to have kids in the next 10ish years? I know that’s a bit of a range lol. So the dog would likely be well into adulthood by then. I do want it to be okay with kids. I know small dogs are more delicate so I would be careful to make sure kids were gentle with her.



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?



\* N/A



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?



\* I live in the US south. No bans that I am aware of.



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?



\* (Farenheit) summer is in the high 70s to 80s and winter is low 50s down to 40s.



\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*



25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.



\* I’m sorry for the long answers lol. I’m definitely overthinking and stressing about this, but I just want to be careful to make the best choice that I can. Thank you for reading my yapping! lol



26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

Lost all savings trading and feeling lost in life ,"I'm 48 years old, I have a serious options trading addiction, and have lost loads of money over the years.

Receiving a considerable inheritance in the near future: how do I manage it properly? ,"Hey all,

To make a long story short: I had an early thanksgiving this week to visit my grandfather who is currently in hospice care. Sadly, this may be the last time I'll see him given his current state. However, after kind of processing everything, my mom sat down with my younger sisters and I to discuss his estate. My mom is the executor of his estate and we don't have really any family on that side, but it's never been really a topic we've openly discussed even though I've had an idea of the circumstances.

To give some context: My grandfather is an amazing, kind, and *insanely* intelligent person. However, if he was born at a different time, he would 100% be diagnosed with Asbergers. He's insanely routine-oriented, he has ate the exact same meal every day for decades, has lived in the same home since the late 70's, and he has two vehicles he's owned for 20+ years with low mileage that look brand new. He's probably one of less than a dozen people over the age of 85 who are certified in Python coding, and considers that a hobby.

Where it gets interesting: He has a very decorated background in aerospace engineering, to put it vaguely. He worked in a high-clearance level position for the DOD, has received a $100k+ pension since the 90s, and has a handful of different patents for what are extremely integral parts of modern military civilian and military aircraft he receives royalties from monthly (of which he receives in a literal physical check by request because cashing them is part of his routine haha). He has well over $25+m in liquid assets barring the valuation of his patents and residual income and a vast majority of that is in various investments.

That being said, my mom broke down how those assets would be divided: She receives all physical assets and essentially  1/3 of his cash assets, my sisters get a 50/50 split of the patents which will be held in a trust and residuals will be interest bearing until they're both 21 (late teens now). I receive 50% of his interest-bearing cash assets, one of his vehicles, and possession of his ""archives"" which include literally thousands of pages declassified rough draft schematics of parts and aircraft he has worked on developing. This equates to roughly $13 m in assets with some contingencies. The archives are priceless. Of course self-fulfilling prophecy, I work in aviation software sales and deal with government data so there's a potential conflict of interest there I may have to deal with but not relevant other than the fact I may have to leave my job at that point in time.

TLDR is: how to I manage this money properly. My wife and I are in our early 30s make a pretty decent living, and want to make sure we manage this properly. I'm thankful to have this opportunity, and I pride myself on managing my money well, but I want to make sure this goes towards the right things for our future.

A lot of the funds are in index funds, but a significant portion are in other various sources such as Bonds, CD's, interest bearing accounts, etc. and many of those bonds and CDs are coming to maturation so they need to be re-invested. We have, regardless of this, been focusing on investing in property in the future but I don't want to solely allocate this towards that and want to do this the right way. 

Where do I start when that time comes?",0,1732388274.0
I feel like I wasted $10k on a car that is having nothing but issues since I got it,"I thought I was doing a financially responsible thing by buying a 10 year old SUV in cash. I bought a 2015 VW for 10k like a year ago and paid all in cash. 

It’s been a year since I’ve had it, and it’s been nothing but issues. Constant engine lights coming up with new codes. Trying to fix things and replacing parts just for that to not be the issue. I feel like I just wasted 10k because I feel like the sensible thing is to get rid of it before even bigger issues come up. 

I’m 26, have about 10k in my savings at the moment. (I paid off my student loans in one huge chunk) so I have no debt. I live at home but I’m looking to get a place with my girlfriend in the next year. Does anyone have advice for what I should do? I feel like eventually my engine is going to blow and then at that point I couldn’t even sell it. Should I just accept my losses and sell it for what I can? 

EDIT: By the way, it is a 2015 VW Tiguan. My old car was a 2004 and was ran into the ground and was becoming unsafe. I held onto it for as long as I could. 

EDIT #2: The car had 100k miles when I got it. I am decent with cars, and everything so far has been worked on by myself. I’ve replace spark plugs, PCV valve, coils, and cam sensor. I guess so far, I’ve really spent under $1000 in repairs. My worry is I know down the line, it may need a timing chain, and I’m thinking I might as well sell it before things add up. ",0,1732044070.0
Need Help Getting Out of Debt and Building Financial Stability – Serious Advice Needed,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for serious advice or opinions on how to pull myself out of the financial hole I’m in and build a better future for my family. Here’s my situation:	

I’m 23 years old, my wife is 21, and we have an 18-month-old toddler.

My wife is a full-time student and doesn’t currently work.

I take home $640 a week with my current job.

We have nearly $9,000 in combined credit card debt and no significant savings.

I’m about to start a new job that’s a pay cut from $21/hour to $18/hour, but it offers more room for growth and commission potential.

We’ve already cut our budget way back to the essentials:

I’m eating one meal a day to save on groceries.

Rent is $500/month, which is as low as we can reasonably get.

We don’t pay for any streaming subscriptions or other non-essentials.

Goals:

1.	Pay off the $9k in credit card debt as quickly as possible.

2.	Start saving for an emergency fund.

3.	Build a long-term financial plan for stability and growth.

Questions:

1.	What are the best strategies to tackle this level of credit card debt? I’m already looking into balance transfers and potentially a debt consolidation loan.

2.	How can I boost my income quickly, even while starting a new job? I’m willing to hustle and explore side gigs or other options.

3.	What are some practical budgeting tips that have worked for you when money is already cut back to the bone?

4.	Any advice for balancing finances with a young family and a student spouse?

I know this is going to take time and hard work, but I’m ready to do whatever it takes. Thank you in advance for any advice or insights you can share.",0,1732031505.0
What kind of credit card should I apply for?,"I have a credit score of 643 and I'm looking to get my first credit card to be used to build credit. I'll pay it off each month so it docent accumulate interest.

Should I move my personal investments back into cash,"2 years ago I had cash to spare so I was investing $700 every month into a personal investment account for the entire year. At the end of that year I got moved to a HCOL area for work so I decided to build up my savings instead and stop investing with a goal of $10k in savings and $10k in checking. Fast forward to today, I have $7.5k in savings, $2k in checking and $10.5k in my personal investment account.

For further context, I contribute to my 401k and get the max match from my company every month. The issue is that every month I feel cash strapped mostly due to HCOL. Should I move the money from my personal investment account to cash? 

The account has floated around $10.5k since I stopped investing in it and I tend to actually pull money out for rare, large(r), emergency expenses. It would satisfy my cash goals almost immediately and from there I can start fresh with the investment account and start putting money back into it ($700/mo). ",0,1732339960.0
Should I buy my father's condo ?,"Hi everyone,

My father (70s) is selling his condo and offered it to me below market value. I'm trying to decide if this is a smart financial move.

**Details:**

* **Condo:** Located in a desirable area with good long-term potential.
   * Estimated FMV: $470k
   * Potential purchase price: $420k (possibly using gift tax exclusion), 
   * HOA fees: $500/month
   * Current tenant rent: $2700/month
   * Condition: Needs some maintenance but overall good.
* **My Situation:** Late 30s, excellent credit, and comfortable with a down payment.
   * First-time homebuyer.
   * Plan to rent it out (not live there).
   * Current net worth: $3 million ($2.5 million in stocks/retirement, $500k in HYSA).
   * Looking to diversify investments with real estate.
* **Inheritance:** May inherit this condo (or its equivalent value) in 10-20 years. However, My brother and I will split any inheritance.

**Questions:**

* **Is buying from a family member advisable in this situation?** What are the potential pitfalls?
* **What due diligence should I do beyond a standard inspection?** (e.g., rental market analysis, understanding landlord responsibilities)
* **Tax implications:** Anything specific to buying from family or inheriting later? Should we formalize the below-market-value aspect as a gift?
* **Any other factors I should consider?**

"Working 12’s, seeking advice for my 2.5 year old GSD. ","When I got my dog I was working 60 hr weeks but I had a partner who worked the opposite shift so it worked out. I’m down said partner and have changed jobs so I’m working 7 12’s every two weeks, so only 14 days a month.

I’ve hired a dog walker for those days I work. She comes a bit over halfway through my shift to let my dog out to potty and walks/plays with him. When I get home I take him out and depending on the weather we’ll stay outside to throw the ball. If it’s gross out we’ll be inside playing tug of war.

Considering filing for bankruptcy [Oregon],"Screenshot of my Finances -
https://imgur.com/gallery/b9pbCql
The IRS website is down until tomorrow which is why that is blank. There is at least $1k debt, probably much more. 

I just started a big girl job this week and get my first paycheck next friday, $28.50/hour. Not making a ton but it will be nice to have a consistent paycheck and benefits. However right now everything I make is going to monthly payments, this isn't counting groceries and expenses just to live. My credit score is already low. I already have a nice reliable car, the RAV4, so I won't need a car loan any time soon. I told my partner it sucks I wouldn't be able to buy a house for 7 years but he said ""with this debt would you even be able to anyways??"" Good point. I'll sell the Subaru as soon as I can afford to replace the windshield, get it detailed, and get a mechanic checkup, so that will help with my monthly output a lot.

I have questions regarding bankruptcy, pretty sure chapter 7 is what I want to go with:

- Will my IRS taxes be able to be filed? And will my state taxes be eligible now that they went to a collections agency?

- Can student loans go on there? I'm pretty sure they can't but I thought I'd ask

- I want to keep at least one credit card to pay off and then have for emergencies. And then build my credit back up by putting all my subscriptions on that card and paying it off every month. I was thinking of keeping the Fred Meyer credit card because it has the lowest debt and the lowest interest, however it has the lowest credit limit so if something seriously expensive happens I'm fucked. REI has the best benefits but the highest debt 🫣. The care credit has saved me with my very expensive and sensitive kitty 😩 so I'm unsure whether I should put that on or not, though that can only be used for medical stuff.

- PayPal credit will for sure go on, but a maybe slightly unethical question in regards to that. It's not maxed out, so if I plan to file bankruptcy anyways can I max it out paying my taxes or something else down and then file? I've been needing a laptop since my cat peed on mine last year, so I would finally get one.

- any other advice from those who are wiser than me. As you can see, I'm not very financially responsible or disciplined 🤦🏽‍♀️😩 though a lot of this debt came from not being able to work for 3-4 months after a serious concussion and my cat getting sick right in the middle of all of that, of course the pet insurance came after that. Then it came from being depressed from my concussion and coping by eating out and buying shit 🫣

No judgement please. I have a TON of shame over my debt and how financially irresponsible I've been 😭",0,1731792447.0

"Dad is 60, in debt, and barely any retirement. Is letting him live in my condo a decent way to get him there?","I'm 24, closing on a condo soon, it's about 6 minutes from my current job, plan was to live there pay it off in 3 years. Have an offer for an out-of-state position in a very niche field that I'm planning on taking .

Dad is currently 60, has drained his 401k multiple times, current balance is around 40k. His current income hovers around 120k, but his major monthly expenses are 2,700 on his apartment. Monthly car payments around 900 & insurance at 400.

I thought he was doing decent, but he recently asked me for $25 to avoid an overdraft fee on his account. So we talked and he currently has

\-60k car loan, worth about 24k at the moment (negative equity)

\-30k on credit cards

\-10k in collections

\-4k personal loans

At his age is it better to declare bankruptcy? He's always wanted to buy a house, but realistically especially in the current market, I don't see him fixing his credit and preparing a down payment.

Current plan I'm thinking is to have him declare bankruptcy, move into my condo, charge him $900 a month so he has fixed expenses. Give him my old car and have him pay for all the bills associated with that (insurance/gas/repairs) . Then have him work 5 years, saving everything so that he can have a decent retirement at 65 with social security covering a large portion of his expenses.

Is this a decent idea? He doesn't have anyone to rely on besides me and my brother who is 18. He's in great shape now and probably has another 20 good years in the tank but I want.

  
Edit:

  
Thank you everyone for the advice, I love my father and want ultimately just want what's best for him. He's a dumbass with money, but still a good man and I'd still be an orphan without him. I'm going to have an in depth discussion with him and my brother this week and go over everything. A lot of this was for my brother, and while he's only 18, he's old enough to be involved in this. As of now the plan is to have him move into the condo after we close, figure out a plan to get him out of debt, whether that's pay it off or declare bankruptcy I'm not sure. He's definitely going to therapy to figure out why he's doing financial self harm, and going through a budgeting course.

While I'm sure his habits won't change overnight, me and my brother are the most important things in his life and he'll listen if we make him. I'm thinking of reviewing his money going in & out on a biweekly basis. Lots of good advice in this thread, I appreciate all the responses.",0,1732286692.0

Training dog not to jump on me when I'm seated?,"Hey! So I'm relatively new at this. I've got my dog, Aragorn (~1.5yrs, some kind of hound) pretty well trained not to jump if I'm standing, but if I'm sitting in a chair, he sometimes tries to get my attention by jumping on me. Which in this case means getting on his hind legs and putting his front legs on my shoulders/throat/face.

I am not fond of having paws on my throat, which I think is understandable. I generally respond by moving his paws off of me and then going to another room so he does not have access to me, my attention, or my neck. 

I would prefer that he simply does not try to do this. Any thoughts on how to train that?

Late on credit card payment for months. Need advice. ,"So I’ve had this particular card for like 10 years or more. I had never not once paid the full balance until around when Covid hit.

Saying goodbye ,"Hello everyone I just really need to talk to someone that has had a similar experience or honestly I just need to get it out. I just put down my 17 year old dog after having her since elementary school. She’d been with me through many stages of my life like moving back to my country, going to a new school, college, moving cities, getting my first job, getting engaged… the worst and best parts of my life. I truly can’t imagine my life without her but I’m happy I gave her the best life possible, I knew she was always happy when she was with me, no matter where we were. I’m happy that she got to see the snow, the beach, the forest, and visited many cities. She was truly the greatest and most wonderful companion. Even though it was hard saying goodbye I’m certain it was the best decision, I always tried to put her needs first before my own. She’s in a better place now. And if someone has been through something similar, I send you a big warm hug. It is not easy to see someone you love have a shorter lifespan. ",1,1729707601.0

"[RIP] Sonny, Pinscher, 15","I wrote the text bellow on 4/10/23. This is a long text about the passing of my beloved and first dog, Sonny. I just felt like today sharing it somewhere. The pain is still here ♥️ I was 11 years old when my mother gifted him to me, my mother always said Sonny was his son, and I always said Sonny was my brother. He will be forever and ever be my older brother ♥️ Even at this moment writing this single paragraph brings tears in my eyes. I still think about him every single day, sometimes I cry, sometimes I get sad, sometimes I smile remembering his happiness, but I am always grateful I had him in my life. I miss you so much my forever brother 🌈💖

I could not upload a photo of him here. Those who are interested I uploaded a photo of him . ♥️

----- 🌈🌈🌈

I lost my 15 year old male pinscher on 4/6/2023, this week, his name was Sonny, he had grade D heart failure, the most advanced grade, mitral valve disease, pulmonary hypertension, pericardial effusion, three herniated discs and he couldn't walk anymore (I bought him a dog wheelchair)... I took him in the backyard to do his things holding him in a cloth, last week I noticed he was getting extremely tired only peeing... He used to take about 15 pills a day, all drugs available on the market, all exams, echocardiograms he did... His desire to live was immense, last Wednesday he had an appointment scheduled with the cardiologist and the echocardiogram, the news was sad, he needed hospitalization, and the guarantee of survival was low, the costs were absurdly high just for a single day of hospitalization, he didn't want to stay, he looked right into my eyes asking to leave, also, there was a veterinary student accompanying the cardiologist, I knew that a case like that was very interesting to be studied, I knew that if I left him there, they would study him, I asked the cardiologist to prescribe home medication and took him home, his condition instantly worsened at home, he couldn't breathe, gave emergency diuretic drugs waiting for them to act, they did not act, he stayed from 4 pm until 9 pm with his head tilted up trying to breathe, I held his head part of the time, put pillows for him to support, stayed by his side, it was the most terrible hours of my life... When I wrapped him in the blanket he looked right into my eyes, he put his little nose on mine, twice, looking right at me, I felt his soul, I didn't know what that meant at the time, but it was his farewell to me... It will stay in my heart forever. I took him back to the veterinary emergency, I took some pictures and recorded a video of him in my mother's arms, he was barely breathing, weakened, tired, with his head up, closing his eyes, looking like he wanted to sleep... They took him to ER, minutes later the veterinarian on duty said that he had a cardiac arrest and had to be intubated... He was injected with adrenaline, he was on oxygen, the vet let me see him intubated, it devastated me, she showed me a vat full of blood and fluid, she said it drained through intubation, the laryngoscope was full of blood, and the cloth where his mouth was resting was also full of blood with clots... I left the room, I cried and cried, I scratched my arms, he was my little baby and I couldn't do anything... The vet said she would try until 2 am, if not, she would stop doing things because it was suffering for him...I walked into the emergency room and kissed him on the cheek and told him I loved him... I went back home and at exactly 2:4 am, the veterinarian called and sent messages saying that he couldn't resist, he had several cardiac arrests... On the morning of 4/6/23 I picked him up, they delivered him in a cardboard box, I didn't have enough courage to open it, me, my uncle and my mother buried him in a beautiful place... With several birds singing, under a coconut tree, my uncle placed white flowers on top... On the 08/04/23, I was crying in the morning, and I asked God and him if he wanted to see me happy he would send me any sign as little as possible, and oddly enough as soon as I asked for it I heard two little screams from him, it was him, I remember clearly, the screams came and went quickly, I asked again but I didn't hear anything else... Today is 04/10/23, and everything reminds me of him, everything, every corner of the house, everything looks like him, I took everything related to him and put it in a separate drawer in my wardrobe, even the little plants where he peed, I kept his fur, clothes, cloths, pillows... Not an hour goes by without me crying, I know it's bad for him and he doesn't want to see me crying, but I can't stand it, the loss is devastating, it's like I've lost part of my own soul. I'm taking sleeping pills every day, sleeping pills almost all the time, I try not to cry but I can't, I know it makes him sad but I just can't... I pray every day, I hope he appears to me, at least in a dream, I ask God, but so far nothing... 
I believe in spiritism, I believe that our beloved animals after they die stay with us for a while and then reincarnate, they evolve, I just knew these days about The Rainbow Bridge, it is a beautiful theory, I believe in part of it, I believe that while our animals wait to reincarnate they stay in that place, sometimes transiting, visiting beloved people and going to that place before reincarnation, the book of Ernesto Bozzano ""Do animals have soul?"" Is a beautiful book, filled with stories about animal reincarnation, stories of animals returning to their owners and about spiritualism... 
It's the first time I write about everything that happened to Sonny and probably the last, I hoped for a miracle but it didn't happen, God knows everything... I had the privilege of having the presence of my beloved dog for 15 years, i have pictures with him when I was a kid, he loved walking, he would jump very high before walking, he made extreme use of his little legs before he stopped walking, he was a very loved dog, very happy, before I took him to the vet on 04/05/23, I carried him in my arms around the street he used to walk, and I swear by all the holiest, he smiled, he smiled seeing the street he used to walk, i'll never forget. I keep praying, I keep crying, I keep waiting for him to appear for me, he was my first dog, he accompanied me for most of my life, from childhood to adulthood, he was a brother to me and a son to my mother. I miss him a lot, I pray that God with the help of the angels will allow me to see him, even for a second... 
He was named after a true story of reincarnation,  for those who are curious there is a film ""Yesterday's Children"" and several documentaries about the history... My dear Sonny...

I Love You Sonny, Forever and Ever, for the rest of my life and beyond space and time...

Delineating dumb vs not for a new car ,"Looking to replace my car (2012 Honda civic coupe). It’s a good car but a hassle with kids (4,2). Generally we take my wife’s car everywhere (2017 CRV). I feel like we are in a decent financial spot to look at replacing my car and want to get some input from folks. 

29m, married, 2 kids. HH income 180k (me 140, her 40). After all bills/expenses, savings for birthdays/vacations/christmas/etc. plus retirement savings (~$4k/mo: 1 401k + 2 roths; wife doesn’t have access to 401k), we have about $3k/mo leftover that just goes into an hysa (about $60k, yes I know it’s wasteful to not invest everything over emergency fund amount). Own a home w/ mortgage at 3%, no other debt. Net worth around $500k (roughly 100k house equity, 400k from cash and retirement) 

So, with $3k in excess of our monthly expenses/wants plus our net worth, I feel like, on paper, I kind of have my “pick of the litter,” in terms of what to go for without sabotaging our future selves. However, also don’t want to do something I’d come to regret. I’m looking mostly at used/new Honda/acura/lexus (not a fan of current gen Toyotas). 

I like the savings of a used car but better rates, warranty, first owner entices me to spend extra on new. And another extension of that, I heavily appreciate quality, so that’s why Lexus/acura are in consideration even with their further higher price. 

Currently looking at used/new Honda passports/pilots, Lexus RX, Acura MDX 

Maybe I need a reality check, but is there an obviously wrong choice here if I plan to keep the car for a decade or longer? Thank you guys for the help! ",0,1732120173.0
Ethical Breeding Questions,"  I have seen a lot content online recently about ethical, responsible dog breeding. I’m super intrigued because it sounds fantastic and a great way to ensure that dogs are cared for properly. I have a couple of questions about some things I didn’t totally understand, though.    

   First, a lot of people talking about this seem to be very focused on large breed dogs. I’ve see a lot of content from dog trainers and people involved in dog sports, who have breeds like Malinois, German Shepards, Retrievers, etc. I think it might be skewing the kind of information I’m receiving about ethical breeders. Are there ethical breeders  of medium and small dog breeds out there? Or is this a  sporting/herding group thing?  
     
   Second, (and probably related to my first question) I’ve seen people talk about breeders “proving” their dogs with sports, shows, jobs, etc. If someone was breeding a dog breed used primarily as a companion like a toy breed, how would they prove that dog? Would they have to show it? Or are their other ways? Am I misunderstanding this?   
      
   Also, if you are someone with a love of a breed but not personally interested in dog sports or showing your dogs, could you ever get into ethical breeding? For instance, if you really have a passion for animal husbandry and preservation of historic and rare breeds, but not for like, agility or hunting. This is hypothetical, please don’t come for me.   
       
   Forgive me if this is the wrong community to ask in, or if I am missing/misunderstanding some information about this! I am genuinely just curious and want to learn. If anyone knows of trustworthy resources where I can learn more, I would love recommendations too!

Did anyone else’s dog become suddenly aggressive to other household pets right at the end of your pregnancy and did that go away after the baby was born?,"We have a 8ish year old coonhound who is normally pretty chill with our other dogs. She's had food resource guarding issues around one of them but we are actually rehoming that dog and he is leaving us this weekend. The remaining dog and our coonhound have never had issues getting along.

I am 38 weeks pregnant today and over the last month our coonhound has been increasingly irritable. Extremely demanding, pushy, vocal, etc. In the last two weeks she has picked three fights with our other dog, the one we are keeping. Two of them she was clearly resource guarding me, and the third was food related (she was hungry, we had started cooking, and our other dog got too close to the baby gate closing off the kitchen). No one was bitten during any of the fights. She also guarded the deck today from our third dog (the one leaving us) which she's also never done and was very unusual behavior. He just tried to walk past her out the door and twice she refused and guarded the door. It didn't escalate into a legit fight because I split them up but still it was strange behavior. In that instance the dog we are keeping was with her the whole time and she didn't care about him at all. 

The changes in her routine I could see being upsetting to her because she is very routine oriented but those things all changed over the course of this entire pregnancy and none of them have changed recently. She has been pretty normal this whole time up until the last month. A little stir crazy sometimes but not aggressive or anything close to it.

We have a vet appointment for her on Friday to rule out any physical issues.

I am really freaking out about this because our coonhound is also extremely maternal and very interested in babies and now I am scared she's going to resource guard the baby from our other dog. Because they hadn't had issues previously we didn't think it would be a problem but now I just don't know. She gets this psychotic like feral glint in her eyes when she goes after him that I've never seen before. Like I look at her and don't recognize her and it really freaks me out. It also scares me that it's unpredictable. The last one, she was sitting next to me on the couch and went after him for just walking too close to me. But literally the day before he was in between her and me on the couch sleeping in my lap all afternoon and she didn't care one bit. She was actually using him as a pillow!

What should I do with my savings,"Okay I am a 28 single man. have a lot in savings and living with my friends and don't have to pay a lot in expenses. Like 400 a month with my friends. About 240 for groceries a month. Another 60 for loose spending. Company gives me a car, car insurance, and a gas card. 

Post tax and health insurance I take in about 4,600 a month.

I have about 136,000 in a high yield savings account that gives me about 400 dollars a month, but compound interest is making that more and more each month. I have another 10 in mutual funds that made me 2,000 in the last year. So 12k in there now.

I talked to a financial advisor months ago, but I was looking at buying a house so didn't want to lock up my money. 

Now my friends that I livd with are pregnant. I need to get out before may. I'm looking at getting my own place.

I theoretically could move it with me father, but I hate my younger brother. Really don't want to. Also dating living with your parents is probably not a good idea at my age.

I'm finding it hard to justify buying a house just for myself especially when I don't know who I'll end up with and maybe I have to move 2 years from now and lose all that money on closing costs and such. 

Renting I obviously see none of that back though. A year's worth of rent would equal more than closing costs.

But I came to the realization that I won't be getting that monthly income from my high yield savings account if I purchase a home. 

So this is what I'm struggling with now:
Do I buy a house or rent? 
If I buy a house what % of my savings should I put into it. 
If I were to move in with my father for a year or so, how should I safely invest my money so that I can use it to buy a house later. Obviously I know you all aren't FAs and everything 

Even if I put all of it down, I'm still going to be paying between 1800-2200. Yes. I do live in NJ. Lol From things I've researched you shouldn't be spending more than 33% of your gross income on housing expenses. That would be close to 50% and then I have no savings and no investment money

I plan to open a Roth in the next year or so as well. I don't want this new account.

Why is the tax taken out of my paycheck above the state percentage? I just saw that my colleague had 3x less withheld from the same hours? Please help me understand as this is my first ,"Hey everyone,

I started my first job in high school two weeks ago and I just recieved my paycheck. Here is a breakdown of the paycheck.

Taxes - $246.36 (FITWH-132.51, MED-13.10, SOC-56.02, and IL-44.73)

Take Home Pay - $657.22

Preparing For My Second Dog,"**Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

* No. My shetland sheepdog sadly passed away at the age of 10 at the beginning of October due to a brain tumour. I still need some time to process losing her and reflect on the time we shared together, and I'd like to use this post as an opportunity to sort my own thoughts, as well as collect the opinions of others. I'm a veterinary nurse with a keen interest in animal behaviour that I'd like to develop into a professional qualification in the coming years. For now, I've done the Fear Free Certification and Dogs Trust's Dog Friendly Nursing courses, which both focus on minimising patient anxiety and stress in the clinic. I also volunteered with a dog rescue for a year during my studies, and do dog walking for my neighbours dogs (a collie/akita and gsd/husky) three to four times a week.

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

* I've got a slight tendency towards breeder, since I would like to have a fresh start with training to try and build good behaviours from the very beginning of the dog's life. That being said, I'm open minded: if the right dog for me appears in a shelter, I've got no issues with going down this route.

**Describe your ideal dog.**

* I'm looking for a life companion that can share a very close bond with me. I communicate better with dogs than with people, and would like an animal who loves being around me as much as I do them. A dog that's intelligent enough to really engage with training, but still enjoys lots of physical contact would be nice. I also enjoy gaming, so a dog that wouldn't mind cuddling up under my desk at the end of the day is a nice thought.

**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

* I'm very passionate about herding dogs, particularly border collies, but I really like German, Australian and Bohemian Shepherds too. I think their emotional intelligence is incredible, and their sensitive natures seem to be a good fit for my personality, as the ones I've met throughout my life seem to have bonded with me quite quickly. I seem to get on very well with fear-aggressive dogs, and have a preference for long-haired breeds. It's selfish, but I've also got a massive thing for tricolours.

**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? \*Basic commands (sit, paw, etc) Off leash training.**

* My focus is on trick training and desensitization. I want to work with my dog to ensure he's open to new experiences and isn't frightened of the world. I'd also like to teach tricks that involve me, such as running between my legs, jumping into my arms etc.

**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

* ﻿﻿Not particularly, though if the dog's drive demands it it's something I'm happy to explore. I don't have experience in these fields.

**How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

* I'm happy to involve my dog in all elements of my life. Several hours per day split between walking, grooming, enrichment and TLC are fine by me. In order to accomodate this I've recently moved job to a practice that allows us to bring pets to work, so the dog would be getting enrichment and attention from several different people throughout the day as well.

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

* I'm happy to do two, hour-long walks per day. I'd like to avoid dog parks as I would prefer to remain in control of the interactions my dog has rather than being forced in to situations by off-lead dogs.

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

* ﻿﻿Happy to do routine brushing on a weekly basis. My last dog had 6-weekly grooming appointments, which I'd gladly continue for my next dog. I'm not great at clipping fur and making it look good, but I can do nails, anal glands, and ear cleaning at home.

**What size dog are you looking for?**

* Medium to large feels right, so in the range of 15-30kg. I want a dog large enough to roughouse and cuddle with, but small enough that I could pick up and carry in an emergency, and not strong enough to pull me off my feet.

**How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

* Shedding and barking were my last dog's main past times, so no issues there! I'd like to be able to keep the barking under control however. I'd like to avoid slobber if possible.

**How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

* Not important. I don't plan on letting the dog off-leash at any point.

**Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

* Definitely snuggly. I want a dog that has no concept of personal space. I think dogs that press right up against your body are the absolute cutest thing.

**Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that's more eager-to-please?**

* A bit of a mix, honestly. I'd like a dog that is keen to please for training purposes, however I like the idea of them surprising me on their own initiative too!

**How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

* I'd like them to be friendly to aloof, if possible. A bit of initial barking is fine, but my last dog did have a tendency to start barking at people on walks if we stopped to chat, which is something I'd like to try and train out this time around.

**Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

* Not particularly - due to the close proximity to other dogs at my work, I really need a dog that is comfortable around both dogs and people.

**Are there any other behaviors you can't deal with or want to avoid?**

* ﻿﻿Separation anxiety
* Hereditary health conditions, wherever possible. Main reason flat-coated retrievers are off the list are due to their predisposition to cancers. I understand all purebreeds have issues, but would like to minimise this as much as I can.

**How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

* At work, likely around 4 hours at a time max, though they will be in the vicinity of animals and people throughout the day. I also plan on leaving them at home a few times a week, and I've agreed with a friend that he will come and dog sit on these days. I work ten hour shifts four days a week, so maybe 2 days in the house, 2 in the office to help avoid them becoming too fixated on me.

**What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

* I will be living alone when buying my next dog.

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

* No other pets at the moment, though I do like the idea of owning two dogs, but likely no more than that.

**Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

* No - I have a 3 and 8 year old niece, but visits from them would be rare. Both are accustomed to dogs, though the youngest is still a little anxious around them.

**Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

* No - going straight for home ownership. Currently looking at two bedroom bungalows with flat, fenced-in gardens.

**What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

* Fife, UK. Our banned breeds at XL Bullies, Pitbulls, Japanese Toas, Dogo Argentinos, and Fila Brasileiros, none of which are breeds I'm particularly interested in.

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

* Between -7c and 25c, with most temperatures being in the 10-15c range.

**Any other info that may be helpful?**

* I'm still not considering getting another dog until my life and my own health are in a better place to accomodate them. I'm planning on purchasing a home within the next year, and fingers crossed will have recieved a promotion at work by then to create some further financial stability.
* As an aside, I'm particularly fond of my neighbour's collie/akita cross, though in reality he's more like a very large collie. I don't want a dog that is *like* him, but I want to love my next dog as much as I love both him and my sheltie.",1,1730316384.0

Both Fed and St tax was taken out: $31.53

Below where it mentions all of that info, it has a section for tax reporting. This is where I am extremely confused. I was under the impression I would have 60 days to rollover the check into my Roth IRA or my current 401k. So I am wondering why taxes were already taken out? And also if it would make sense at this point to even roll it into my 401k if state and federal taxes were taken out when a 401k is pre-tax? If that is the case, then how would I rollover the amount into my Roth IRA if I already maxed it out for the 2024 year, so I cannot contribute more to it? Would I have to open a new IRA just to avoid the tax penalty that I assume I would still have to pay on my taxes next year? 

Within the tax reporting section it also mentions that there is an eligible amount for rollover which was the gross amount mentioned above. How can I roll over the gross amount when the check amount is not that amount? 

Any and all help will be appreciated. ",0,1732112186.0
Money Was Returned After Receiving iMac.,"I received my iMac yesterday and today I checked my bank account and the money was returned. I didn't receive an email or anything. Of course I could leave the money there and just wait for Apple to eventually take the money back HOWEVER, I have an appointment on Monday to close the account that I used to pay for the iMac. 

Info as to why I'm closing down the bank account:

A couple months ago I decided to finally separate ""my"" account from my dads account as I'm already an adult and I thought that was settled but a day after I bought the Mac I went to make a deposit and I was informed that my account was still registered as a minor account. I couldn't close out the account that day as the purchase was still pending so I made the appointment for Monday. As I stated above, the money was returned and my dad is impatient so he wants to close down the account on Monday and he told me to keep the money because it wasn't my fault it was returned. However I was planning on setting up Apple Pay on my phone after I get my new account and I was wondering if they do charge me again/take the money back, would it be from the card used on Apple Pay? or would it be taken from my dads account as my current account is under my dads name?

Just incase whatever happens, I downloaded a file of my receipt where it states that they charged my card. ",0,1731799310.0

Is there a better way to go about getting out of this debt?,"Disclaimer: I’m 20 I made a stupid mistake. I still live with my father and don’t pay rent, however want to move out by next year. 
At the beginning of this year I fell victim to a scam online get rich quick scheme (it was a sales “training”) I spent my savings, and took on 6k of debt. 

While going through two car wrecks, and other misc things I’ve been able to eliminate a 3k credit line down to 350$, then I have one maxed out card, discover at 2500 with 0% interest and one last capital one card at 1600 with 30% apy 

I have just used the last 400 of my emergency fund to pay off the 350 and 50 of the discover credit. 

I’m torn between trying to rebuild some sort of emergency fund, or focusing all of my money into paying off my debt. 

I take home about 1300 bi weekly, and imagine (taking into account my car insurance of 757/mo) that I can get completely out of cc debt by the end of February 2025.

Dog alone while at work ,"Hey everyone here! I’m new and looking for advice/help. My husband started a new job in a different place so it means he’s gone from Monday morning until Wednesday evening. I go to school full time and leave the apartment around 6:45 am. 

Before, my husband used to work afternoons 12:30 - 8 pm and was with our dog during the day and I’d arrive around 3:45 pm and sometimes earlier. He was alone for short periods of time and was used to have someone there in the morning. 

My husband started his new job three weeks ago. I go out with our dog for half an hour before I leave for school to make sure he 💩 and pees. A good friend from us comes around 11:30/12 and walks him for another half hour. I come normally at 3:30 pm and go with him for a longer walk in the forest. Around 1 hour or longer to make up for the short walks during the day.

What I want is basically advice on toys/stuff that I can give him to do so that he’s not so bored the entire time he’s alone. I can see him through the camera and it makes me sad to see him lying down by the door. I think he’s really bored. He doesn’t get destructive but he has started to bark. 

Do you know of any toys that are safe for dogs to play alone with? I’ve seen some Kongs you can stuff with treats or other things but I’ve also seen dogs getting their tongue stuck in there. That’s a fear of mine. That he gets into trouble with the toy and no one is there to help him. 

Please don’t come for me. I’m doing my best under the circumstances. When I can o also bring him to school but that’s not always possible. Normally only when I have workshops where dogs are allowed. Which doesn’t happen all the time. 

Thank you! ",1,1726644436.0
"New start, new dog? ","I am in my last year of college before I move to a new city. I currently live with my father who is 100% on board with me getting a dog, and I live near rivers, forests, beaches, you name it. The problem is, I am moving to a bigger city that I will not be able to drive in, and I will not be living with my father. I will instead be living with my boyfriend, his mother, and his brother, who all know how to take care of dogs and would be happy to take care of it if something happened in my life

    **Introduction**

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    * Not my first dog. I've had many dogs over the years. I've grown up with them, been taught over and over again how to deal with aggressive dogs, how to train them, even had a few run-ins with aggressive dogs and have been able to test different methods on how to de-escalate a situation.

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    * I'd preferably rescue a dog from a shelter, but I also want a younger dog to be able to give an impression on it young.

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

    * A smart dog who I can raise to be strong, capable, affectionate, and who will come with me on all of my outdoor adventures 

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    * I'm going to be honest. I love border collies and Australian shepherds, but I do understand the hard work and effort that you need to put into raising a dog like that. That's part of why I love them, but I don't think I live in the right type of area for those

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    * All of the basics, but I'd also love to train my dog to do some sort of sport or activity that can be mentally stimulating for it and grow our bond and trust deeper

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

    * I would love to compete with my dog in a sport! I have no experience in it though.

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * I would devote all of my time to my dog if I could. I will be at home most of the day this year, and then I will be job searching for a few months after I move away, so I will still be able to be home most of the time while the dog is still very young.  

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * As long as I'm not in class or doing schoolwork, I can be with my dog. I'm already a very restless person as it is so it would be refreshing to have a companion to go on hikes and down to the river or beach with. I'd most likely go for a short 30 minute walk in the morning, and then once I get home if I have school, I can spend a few more hours(2-3?) walking, running, ect on a busy day. Then if I have a day off, I can spend the whole day on the beach, in the forest, or at the river

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    * I would brush my dog multiple times a day if needed. I am open to trimming, cleaning ears, and all of that. It's just a natural part of owning a dog

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

    * Medium to large size. I don't like small dogs

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * Any amount of shedding is fine for me as I am not allergic, barking would need to be minimal since I do have neighbors, and I hate dog slobber.

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    * As much as I'd love to, I don't think I'd be able to let my dog off-leash much outside of my home

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    * I like affectionate dogs, but not particularly snuggly

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    * Eager to please
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    * I want to train my dog to be okay with noises and stimuli all around it. I want my dog to be able to rely on me for the OK

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * Yes.

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    * I cannot deal with dogs that are stubborn and loud like huskies. I cannot sit and fight with a husky because it wants to take a right turn and I want to take a left. As cute as it is, I'd go crazy

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * My father never really leaves the house anymore (physically disabled), and my boyfriend, his mom, and his brother are all probably going to be working different shifts from me. I doubt the dog will be left alone much or for very long periods of time

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    * My family cannot deal with loud dogs. Especially in the city, loud dogs are a no.

    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

    * My boyfriend has a senior dog who is about to pass away. She is a mini pincher mix

    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

    * No. We do not have, and do not plan to have any children 

    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

    * We are in an apartment now. We will be in an apartment when I move to the big city too. I don't believe there are any restrictions on breed or weight, just the deposit that I have to pay

    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

    * USA, and I don't think so

    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

    * Summer is 80-100°F and winter goes to around 29-40°F

    **Additional Information and Questions**

    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

    * I am also low-income so price may be a barrier for me depending on some factors

    26) Feel free to ask any questions below.",1,1726696263.0
Upgrade home in MCOL,"Currently live in a MCOL area with a paid off home worth about $515k. With four children and potential in-laws moving in with us, considering purchasing a larger home to have aging parents live with us, an office as I am a remote worker and sit in a hallway today, and generally more space. 

Current home is about 3100 sqft across 3 floors and the house we are looking at is 6000 sqft, so plenty of area for in-law suite and fun spaces for kids, asking price is $1.1M.  We would sell our home and roll it into this with a mortgage payment of $6-6.5k/month. 

Financial overview: $500k HH salary plus 30% annual cash bonus (new job last year), $1M retirement account, $330k brokerage account, paid off home valued at $525k, and 6 month emergency fund. 40 years old with 4 children from 14 to 8. 

Expected time in this larger house is 10 years, which sees us through all children turning 18, and parents approaching mid 80s. 

This would slow our savings, but would still be able to save around $100k/year. Should we move and take on a mortgage, lessen disposable income and reduce saving rate or take this house on which would enable fun teenage experiences and aging parents?

Pro-Rata rule can sometimes be desirable?,"I have read a lot about the pro-rata rule (in the context of Backdoor Roth) and this is my current understanding. It is not a penalty, nor is it double taxation. It is effectively just converting pre-tax money into post-tax money, which seems to be not always ""bad"" depending on your financial goals. If you have pre-tax dollars sitting in a IRA account, pro-rata rule will trigger when the backdoor roth is executed. But that means over time, the basis in that IRA account increases, meaning that in the future you have to pay less taxes on that money upon withdrawal (because your increasing your basis). Building up basis over time can be a legitimate financial strategy. So then my question is, why is the pro-rata rule always frowned upon and tried to be avoided, any why does no one ever discuss the benefit (building up basis)?",0,1731875264.0

Help finding the right dog breed,"My partner and I are looking for a dog but could use some advice when it comes to breeds, we greatly appreciate any help!

**Introduction**

1\)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I had a family dog that I helped to train/raise, but it will be my partner's first dog.

2\)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Reputable breeder

3\)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Intelligent, loyal, trainable, and gentle. A dog that can thrive in a family suburban environment, with both weekend hiking adventures and relaxing days at home. Mid-sized, anywhere between 35-75 lbs.

4\)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* This is where we need some help! So far we've mainly looked at Shepherds and Retrievers. My partner and I are drawn to breeds like Australian Shepherds (or MAS) and Duck Tolling Retrievers, as we've met some we really like, and they seem to be the right combination of size, friendly temperament, and trainability.

5\)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Primarily obedience training (allowing for things like traveling together, camping, going various public places without concern), but my partner is also interested in agility courses.

6\) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No, but my partner is interested in agility sport, just not competitive.

**Care Commitments**

7\) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* At least an hour walk/play each day, along with 30-60 minutes of training. My partner works from home and I work close to home so the dog would rarely be left alone for more than 4 hours.

8\) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* One hour, minimum. We have extensive trails and an off leash dog park nearby.

9\)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Weekly brushing. I don't have any experience grooming. We could take the dog to a professional groomer if needed but that's not preferred (at least regularly).

**Personal Preferences**

10\)	What size dog are you looking for?

* 35-75 lbs. Not super small, not super big.

11\) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding: Can handle medium shedding, like that with average double coat breeds.

* Barking: Excessive barking is a concern. Alert barking is fine, but barking which doesn't stop could be a problem.

* Slobber: Average slobber is fine.

12\) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Extremely important. We are looking for a dog we can trust off-leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13\) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Either is fine, or a mix of both! Neither is a dealbreaker.

14\) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More on the side of Eager-to-please.

15\) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* A bark to alert is good, but then once I acknowledge and respond it would stop. I would prefer the dog is cautious/alert but friendly to strangers.

16\) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. We have hundreds of dogs in our neighborhood and need a dog that can get along with its neighbor dogs. It will have plenty of dog-friends!

17\) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Overly-reactive behavior, destructive separation anxiety, excessive (beyond normal) barking.

**Lifestyle**

18\) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 3-4 times a week the dog may be left alone for 4-5 hours. Partner works from home so most days someone will always be home.

19\) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Both partner and I are dog lovers, and are both committed to doing the required work (feeding, cleaning, exercising, training, etc).

20\) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Planning on getting a cat eventually.

21\) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, we plan to have children in the future, I have young relatives, and there are children in the neighborhood.

22\) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No, I own my home with a sizable lot with plenty of room for the dog to run.

23\) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Minnesota, USA. No.

24\) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Hot summers , cold winters (Minnesota, USA). The dog would need to be able to go on walks in the snow in the cold.",1,1727535073.0
"My dog eats everything (yes, the gross stuff) and nothing has worked. ","I adopted my hound mix (he has a tiny bit of german shepherd in him as well) about 2.5 years ago. He was already 1.5 years old when I got him. Aside from his natural hound nature to eat everything, I think he must have been neglected or been a stray for a very long time previously, because he eats it all. 

I've tried bunches of alternatives to get him to stop eating his own poop as well as other dog's too - he'll never stop. At this point, I know it's behavioral because his lab results always come back fine. 

I just need reassurance that muzzling him on walks is the right thing to do. I'm actively training him and he's gotten really used to it. It's sad though, because he doesn't sniff things like he wants to with it on.

Ugh, so tired of my boy grabbing all sorts of things. I'm human and can't catch it all. The stigma and people's judgment/ignorance will suck when he has it on in public, but at this point, I don't really have another choice. ",1,1728491636.0

Auto finance bank sent me a refund for unused warranty even though I cancelled warranty a long time ago. Is this normal? ,"My car was totaled back in August, so it was paid off and the account was closed. This week, I received a $2500 check from my finance bank labeled as “unearned warranty premium.” I called the bank to figure out exactly what this was and they say it’s from a $6500 dealers extended warranty that I purchased when I first financed the vehicle. However, I cancelled that extended  warranty just days after purchasing the vehicle, and I remember receiving a $6500 refund. It was sent straight to the finance bank and applied to the balance of the car loan instead of being mailed to me as a physical check for $6500. So all this time, I thought it was already cancelled and refunded. 

According to my finance bank, though, the warranty was never cancelled, and this is why I’m now receiving a refund for $2500. They said it’s prorated and the $2500 coincides with the amount that was left on the warranty until the expiration date on my loan. But as I said, it was already cancelled back then.

"[RIP] Remy, Rottweiler","
Oh Rem-Dog you were the best. Where do I even start. 

I will never forget the day we met at the shelter. I walked alongside the rescue director as she introduced me to several of your friends who fit what I was looking for in a dog.

They were all much smaller than you. I didn’t have much space at the time, just a small studio apartment I lived in by myself before I moved in with your mom :)

Out from the corner came you, an old, crusty eyed, hulking Rottweiler with slobbery jowls. You came up to me and started rubbing yourself against my legs.

“He sure likes you” laughed Alyssa the tour lady. I asked her what your name was and she told me Remy which I immediately loved. Reminded me of Jeremy “RemDog” Remy the broadcaster for the Boston Red Sox I grew up listening to on the radio. 

I asked her your story, she told me you were a stray estimated to be 7-10 years old and had been at the shelter longer than any other pup. I’ll be honest, as cool as you were I didn’t think I would make a good fit with you. Jesus, at 110lbs you just about took up my whole apartment. 

But Alyssa insisted you were a perfect match. She explained you were low maintenance and didn’t have much enthusiasm for exercise (boy did she hit the nail on the head with that one). I’ve never met a dog that slept so much in my entire life.

Eventually she wore me down and I agreed to have her bring you up to my apartment for a tour. You made yourself right at home, curling up in the bean bag chair shaped like a catchers mit I kept in the corner (which eventually became your favorite place to sleep).

I adopted you a week later and you officially became mine. It took you awhile to get used to your new environment. You were pretty secluded for 6 months, I was starting to worry I wasn’t being a good dog dad. But eventually you came around and became the sweet, loving, grumpy old man me and your mom loved.

I knew your time was limited so I made an effort to take you everywhere. I will miss Dad and Rem truck rides. You were such a kind old soul. Every bystander we encountered loved you and were forced to stop and give you pats.

The kids in line at the drive-in movie theater concession line were always so happy to see you. I’ll miss those days too. Your mom and I would lay out pillows and blankets in the bed of the truck for the movie. We’d snuggle up in the back eating popcorn and snacks and you’d curl up right between us. 

I’d sneak you pieces of popcorn and a bite of my hot dog. Your vet probably wouldn’t have liked that but you were old so I said what the hell. 

For 2 years and 4 months you were an absolute joy to me and your mom’s life. The past year with all of us living together in our house has been the best year of my life.

You had a bad eye you couldn’t see out of. I’ll never forget Sunday morning greeting you in your catchers mitt bed and you not seeing me. It wasn’t until you got up and walked into the dryer and then the table legs head on that I realized you had gone completely blind. You shook like a leaf and trembled in fright. The home you had lived in for the last year of your life you were struggling to navigate. 

It broke my heart to see you like that. I sighed with tears welling in my eyes, I knew it was time. I sat on the floor and held you tight. I nuzzled into your neck and sobbed. “I wish we had more time” “I wish we had more time” I said over and over again.

I called your mom who was at work to let her know the news, she was devastated. She drove straight home from work to see you.

We were going to take you to the vet but to our dismay all the nearby vets were closed on Sundays. I was so angry. Why can’t they be open Sunday? What the hell was I supposed to do if my dog was suffering and needed to be put down on a Sunday.

I was just voicing the despair of an already terrible day. In hindsight, it was a blessing. We had one more day with Rem dog and we knew it. We had pizza delivered, your grandparents came to visit and say goodbye. We ate and all gave you your favorite part the crust. You gobbled down the pizza crust raggedly and we all smiled as we saw your tail fluttered back and forth for just a second. 

We didn’t move from the living room that day. We set up the blankets and pillows right on the rug like we did for drive-in movies and we made sure you felt loved the entire night.

 We agreed at 6am we would head out to take you to the vet which opened at 7. We woke up at 5:45am and the tears were already flowing. I so badly didn’t want to leave. I wanted to kick my boots off and snuggle on the floor some more but I knew if we didn’t do this now I’d never find the courage to get back up.

I scooped you up for one more truck ride. We all piled in. I drove, mom in the passenger and you curled in the middle. One hand held the wheel and the other gently scratched your head. “Oh RemDog you were a good boy” I kept saying through tears. 

I parked the truck and we had a moment. I decided I’d give you and mom one more moment together so I went inside to tell the desk lady. She looked me in my eyes which had been swollen from many tears. She had a gentle but sorrow expression on her face that told me she knew my pain. I went back up and I scooped you up in my arms. 

You trembled in my arms which shattered my heart. The doctor allowed us to sit on the floor and hold you while she administered the shot. 

They gave us a box to place you in along with several nearby pet crematoriums. I lifted you into the truck and kissed your head. I thought of the troubled life you had and hoped that the 2 years we had you had made up for it. I unclicked your collar and kissed you on the head again. “You’re free now” I said.

Today I picked up your ashes. They came in a custom wooden box, courtesy of the older gentleman who ran it. He was a very kind old man and talked to me at great lengths in his driveway about you. He even cried with me after I’d told him your story.

The wooden box had your paw print engraved. It had the day we brought you home since we didn’t know what your real birthday was and the day you passed.

Remy my old man, you were the best dog I could have ever asked for. I will never forget you. Maybe in the next life we’ll find each other when you’re just a pup so we can enjoy the full ride together. But I’m still grateful for every second I got to spend with you. Although I wish it were longer, I had an absolute blast. I reached out to Alyssa at the shelter today and thanked her for introducing you to me. We shed some tears over the phone, they all missed you too. 

Until we meet again Remy. I love you buddy,

~ Dad

Should I save or pay off my mortgage? ,"Hey, first time posting here. I'm based the UK and been reviewing my finances and mortgage...and it's got me wondering what is the best thing to do. Honestly a bit clueless when it comes to money things. 

I have some money in shares, bitcoin and high yield savings accounts. I have about 15k in total across everything in my name.

Monthly payments: 
I pay £500 a month into my mortgage, £500 on other bills and about £200-500 into savings and shares a month, depending on the month

Yearly bills including car insurance, rates, house insurance, heating oil etc is about 1k+ a year.

Money left over mostly goes to holidays and trips away. I'm not much of a spender, I don't buy myself anything unless I need it. I'm more of a saver. 

I have 47k left to pay off on my mortgage. I have 1.99% interest rate for the next year. I have options to overpay each month and pay lump sums. 

Is it better to have more money available in my shares and savings or try to pay off my mortgage? 


Edit: I also have a pension that I didn't mention, no idea what's in it",0,1732455952.0
529 providers and fees - is Utah worth it?,"As per  https://my529.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Asset-Based-and-10000-Tables_090924.pdf the fees vary from 0.100% (Total US stock marker) to 0.200%. I am thinking of investing in a ""target date"" fund that has a 0.114% fees - doesn't this seem quite high given that an equivalent fund in 401K or IRA has much lower fees? 

What's the recommended asset to invest in if I want it to grow semi-passively? I can probably change things around if needed but maybe the fees are worth it to let them administer it and use the target date fund as a ""set and forget"" option until my kid is ready to start using the money?",0,1732122652.0

Can someone help me with a training term?,"I'm thinking of a concept in training but the name for it has completely slipped my mind and it's going to drive me crazy.

It's essentially when a dog will do a behavior because it is practiced (and has been previously rewarded), but they are not necessarily doing it because of the reward. Or basically they do something because they've done it 100 times and it's just second nature. 

For example, when I walk my dog in an off leash area, there are spots where I will always call him back and leash him up. I would always give him a treat for this. Now when we walk, when we get to those locations he automatically comes back to be leashed up, regardless if I have a treat or not. 

It would also apply to the concept of loose leash walking or recalls; I've seen some trainers say that training with rewards is inefficient because there are some distractions that will be greater than any reward, but that's not necessarily accurate because of this concept - my dog will recall whether or not I have a steak, for example, because he's done it thousands of times at this point so it is reflexive.

I know ""fluency"" isn't the exact term I was looking for - any other ideas? ",1,1728052531.0

Recently got a cat and need advice for getting my dog used to her.,"My cat was born about 5 months ago and i waited about a month to start introducing her to my dog. It has been about 4 months of exposure and my dog still acts like it is the first time she’s seen my cat when she sees her. I have tried many different methods (training it out of her, waiting it out, controlled environment, treats, consistent exposure, etc) but nothing has helped. When i say my dog acts like it is the first time she’s seen my cat, i don’t mean that she barks at her. My dog runs up to her and licks her until sopping wet and only stops when she absolutely has to (like if i put my cat away). My cat is not scared of her at all and actually likes my dog. She rolls over on her back trying to play with my dog. I just don’t want my dog being so rough, I feel so defeated, any advice would be tremendously appreciated.",1,1726450731.0

401k withdrawal question ,"I am in need of some financial advice….here are some stats to consider before my inquiry  further below…
-I’m in the state of Florida, 47 years old, still employed with my company for which I have my 401k with still (knock on wood)
-currently have a $20k 401k loan out, of which I still have $8k of that, so I owe $12k, as it just began the payback of this
-credit card (quickly accruing TONS of interest monthly) and medical debits of roughly $43k
-I’m eligible to do a withdrawal (yes, I do understand this is not the most sound financial step TO make ✌🏻) for $56k-ish, of which I would get $45k-ish since I would lose the $11k-ish 20% federal fee for doing a withdrawal and not a loan
-lastly, I’m not necessarily worried abt the huge “dent” this will put in my 401k for the long run
SO….i ask you all this, in the state of Florida, what worst case scenario penalty am I looking at in a few months when I need to file my taxes? I believe I read and was told 10% of the $56k would need to be paid, in addition to the 20% federal fees up front, pls let me know anything I may be missing, as I need to get debt free for the time being to lessen some financial stress, thanks in advance! 😎✌🏻",0,1732298598.0
Best Vanguard Mutual Funds ,"I have an HSA with HealthEquity and will be making the maximum contribution limit in 2025. 

I am wondering what are the best Vanguard Mutual Funds to invest my HSA balance in for growth.  I’m fairly risk tolerant when investing, as well. There are 31 Vanguard funds offered to invest in (bonds, stocks, target date funds). I am leaning towards selecting my own investment options instead of having it auto-selected/administered by HealthEquity.  

I am in my mid 40s, healthy, and do not have any regular prescription needs.  I plan to pay any medical costs out of pocket so I can let the HSA balance grow. 

Will also be rolling over the balance of my current HSA into my new HealthEquity HSA (beginning 1/1/25).  

Looking forward to your perspectives and recommendations, thanks! ",0,1732205024.0
Potty (re)training an adult dog,"I have a 5 year old female dog I need to re-potty train and I am really torn on how to navigate a training schedule with my work schedule. Please let me know of anything I might be missing, I'm desperate. Here's the history and plan.

History: Got her when she was a puppy and fully house-trained her using usual tactics. When she was 1, my then-boyfriend moved in with his couple-months old puppy, who was also house-trained. I'm not sure what happened but they both started going to the bathroom in the house when unsupervised. It was been hell ever since. The other dog moved out 2 years ago and my dog is still having accidents in the house. Sometimes she will not have any accidents for a few weeks (like 3-4 max). But for the most part, I pick up poop a few times a week and pee about once per week. I swear I take her outside many times per day and she does go outside too. I just can't deal with this for another (hopeful) 10 years. It's embarrassing and honestly just degrading to constantly clean up the messes. I have all hardwood flooring downstairs and carpet upstairs. I even replaced the carpet and painted a layer of Kilz on the subfloor to eliminate the urine scent after the other dog moved out.

Plan: Deep clean my floors/carpet with an enzyme cleaner. I will take her outside every 30 min. If she goes potty, she will get supervised free time inside. If she does not go potty, she will go in the crate for 30 min. Regardless, back outside every 30 min. I will keep her crated when I'm not home. Rinse and repeat for few days and lengthe I have 2 weeks off work coming up and will pretty much be home for the most part, only leaving for a few hours at a time and can be dedicated. 

My questions:

1. I work 12 hour shifts, which is a long time to be crated. I do go home on my lunch breaks (so crated for about 6 hours, let out, then another 6 hours). But come winter, I'm not able to go home every single shift, depending on the weather. Sometimes I get mandated at work, so even with coming home on break, she could still be crated for 10 hours at a time (not often, but still). That feels like too long. Will she need to be crated forever when I am not home, once she is fully trained for a few months? 

2. She has accidents when I am sleeping. Do I need to crate her when I sleep too? Would keeping her leashed/tied to my bedpost near me suffice? Or might she start to eliminate right there? She always sleeps in my room, my room is actually the only in the house she hasn't gone to the bathroom in and I'd hate for that to change.",1,1731927334.0
