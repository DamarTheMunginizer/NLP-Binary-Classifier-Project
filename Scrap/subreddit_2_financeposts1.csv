personalfinance,Roth IRA contributions to 403(b),"My organizations open enrollment period just opened and I noticed something new in the benefits.

""Roth IRA Contributions: Employees now have the option to make additional Roth (post tax) contributions to the 403(b) plan. The limit on annual contributions is $7,000.""

Is this a mega backdoor Roth? I already plan to contribute the max ($23,500) to my retirement plan in 2025 and our combined income will likely put us over the limit to contribute to a Roth IRA. This doesn't mention any income limits, so should I be fine to contribute? It also doesn't make sense that it sounds like the money is going into the existing 403(b) account. ",1732199670.0

personalfinance,Inherited mutual funds. Thinking of selling and moving to ETFs. Worried about taxes. ,"Hi all - 
Hopefully an appropriate question. In the passing of a family member, I inherited an account with a decent amount of money divided between 2 mutual funds: AMCAP and AWSHX. I looked at the cost bases for these and they’re upwards of 0.50 and have underperform VOO for the last like 20 years. I am considering selling these and just putting it in a low cost ETF. I’m worried about the tax implications but still think this would save me money in the long run? Wanted to get y’all’s thoughts on just keeping the mutual funds since I already have them or if moving to a low cost etf would be a better strategy.

personalfinance,Double-checking my understanding of retirement plan contribution limits,"I have a 401k through work with a 4% employer match. My wife and I each have a Roth IRA, but since she is currently skilling up to start a new career and gets irregular paychecks, I contribute to both. I'm planning my last 1-2 contributions for 2024 and want to double-check my understanding of the limits. 

Questions:

401k limit for 2024 is $23,000. Am I correctly understanding that this only counts *my* elective deferrals, meaning if I contributed $15,000 from my salary so far (and employer has matched X), I can contribute $8,000 more?

Roth IRA limit for 2024 is $7,000. I've contributed $4,800 to both IRAs. Am I correctly understanding I can contribute $2,200 more to each?

Summing up the contributions, I could contribute a total of $8,000 (out of my salary) + $2,200 + $2,200. Is that right?

Finally, what are some things to consider as I plan for future contributions? I am thinking I'll make two more contributions to each account this year to meet the limits, which means taking home less pay from my job, and having a little less to spend through the end of the year (or just drawing from savings). Alternatively, is it ""better"" in principle to gradually increase my contributions (so, not meet the limits for this year), and then next year divide up the limit by 12 months and contribute regular amounts to meet the limits for 2025?

personalfinance,Mega backdoor Roth questions,"I am a relatively high earner, 200k after bonus, which makes me ineligible for the Roth IRA. I am pretty lucky that my employer has a mega backdoor Roth option through the 401k provider. Is that Roth account treated the same as a typical Roth IRA? So any principal I should be able to withdraw after 5 years without penalty, I would only pay a penalty if I withdrew earnings right? 

It's through fidelity so when I look at the details it has the date of my first deposit into the account, then it has the date when it's eligible for first withdrawal 5 years later. Is there any advantage to go with the typical backdoor Roth vs the mega backdoor Roth besides the contribution limit and the choice of brokerage?

personalfinance,Necessary Dental Procedures That I Cannot Afford- Need Advice,"Hi reddit!

I found out recently that I need to have a string of dental procedures/surgeries done that will cost me more than I can afford even with insurance. I looked into the clinics/universities and they cannot accommodate the urgency and actually cost around the amount of what it costs to have it done elsewhere with insurance.

I discussed a payment plan with my dentist but it still would not be very helpful/would make it impossible to pay my bills for that month. What have you all done for this? 

I'm thinking of opening up a new credit card for this but am wary about it as I have just started getting my credit back on track and it's still not stellar (656).

Any help/advice would be so appreciated. Thank you in advance!

TLDR (backstory);

I finally got dental insurance after almost a decade and was able to go to the dentist. Unsurprisingly, I need to have a procedure done which could have been avoided with preventative care. The procedure is for an infected area that will only spread if waited on and requires a bridge as there will be front teeth extractions (opting for this over implants because that would be financially impossible). 

This is coming at a horrible time as my fiance and I are throwing a wedding in 6 months (cheapest possible wedding in NY but the wedding tax is real) and I just got this new job and was making much less before that.",1732187101.0

personalfinance,Moved to France. Should I move remaining USD to EUR? Withdraw relatively small retirement accounts? Trying to buy a house.,"Hello all, I'm hoping this is the right place/way to ask this.

I have almost zero knowledge about stocks, investments, etc. 5 years ago I moved to France from the US, and it is safe to say that I will not be moving back to the US. I'm working, married with a French woman, have a daughter. I have moved my entire life over here.

We are looking to buy a house here, and I am thinking that now is a good time to move my investments and USD to EUR. I was hoping for some advice. Also, general advice, as I see the USD is strong at the moment, buying 0.95€.

I have the following accounts:

* liquid/checking/savings: $1k, I've already been using this
* Invesco: $33k
* HSA: $7k
* 401k: $19k
* IRA: $3k

Moving Invesco incurs no fees, so that is a simpler question of just ""will it grow even more in the next few months?"". I'm leaning towards no, and to just go ahead and transfer that over, as an investment in a larger down payment for a house seems like a wiser choice.

The other accounts are all small retirement accounts. I know I would be hit with fees for withdrawing from them, but part of me wants to just go ahead and pull the money out and rip the bandaid off. what is more valuable, that $7k right now toward a house, or that money as and HSA in 32 years?

Or is that being too short-sighted? And it would actually be best to keep an investment vehicle in USD? Or save those retirement accounts for another 32 years (I'm currently 33)?

Any advice would be extremely appreciated.

personalfinance,What's a good portfolio to build after rolling old 401ks into IRAs?,"Finally deciding to stop being lazy and roll over my old employer 401ks into IRAs so I can do more than just change investment distributions around.

I lean on the riskier side but I’m not trying to gamble my life retirement away. I was thinking VTI / VOO (or maybe even just VT) as a base then some sprinkling of growth, dividends and REITs.

Unique situation is that each of us hope to buy another house in 10-14 months so I don’t want to do anything to hinder that. The car payment should not have a significant impact on DTI but I’m wondering what the advantages/disadvantages are of taking out a joint loan vs just one of us?

personalfinance,"Approaching Roth IRA Income Limit, Should I lower MAGI and contribute or rollover","My Wife (34F) and I (32M) are about to reach the Roth IRA Income Limit and I am unsure what to do with my IRA. We have next to no debt outside of our Mortgage and are already making extra payments. She was recently offered a salary of $165,000, and with my salary of $80,000 we will be over the Roth IRA Income Limit next year if we don't lower our MAGI.

I have generally tried to help her with her finances but this one will be beyond my knowledge. She will be almost doubling her salary next year so its a very large increase in income for us. My plan was to get her to maximize yearly contribution to her Trad 401k to lower her taxable income. A few reasons for this, since her salary will be jumping so much she wont miss the money being invested, it will set her up for retirement, It might drop us a tax bracket and it will put us below the Roth IRA income limit.

Obviously if she doesn't want to contribute that much I'm not going to force her, and part of me feels like trying to force us to stay under the income limit seems like a losing battle in the long run. In an ideal scenario we will both get raises and promotions that will outpace the limit increase.

So I am asking to see if you all have some ideas, here are the main options I've thought of but would love to hear some other perspectives.

1. Wife increases Trad 401k to $23,500 next year, We are below limit, I continue to contribute the same to my Roth IRA and Roth 401k.
2. Wife contributes whatever she wants, I keep my Roth IRA but stop contributing because of limit, Double my Roth 401k contributions.

If you are wondering the Roth IRA is from before we were married, and I guess I just fall into the group of ""I'd rather just pay taxes now and just not think about it in the future""

||Me|Wife|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Salary|$80,000|$165,000|$245,000|
|Current 401K|$24,000 (Roth)|$26,000 (Trad)|$50,000|
|IRA|$11,000 (Roth)|$0|$11,000|

Will collections agencies come after me or my property in the future if they fail to pay or don’t change their address? I own a house with a mortgage. 

Can my family member have put anything on their forms to make my liable without me being present or signing or would I have to be there for something like that?

I have 2.5 years left till I graduate. I want a vehicle, but I don’t know if I should get one. My job and school is within a 10 min bus ride of where I currently stay.  Starting fall quarter 2025, I will transfer to a university and the apartment I plan to get with section 8 will be very close to the university. I’m waiting for the section 8 voucher orientation (was told it could take 6 months due to back log of clients), which is fine. 

Should I get a car? I’m torn because one side of me is saying stay disciplined and save your money - Maxed out Roth IRA, I have 6 months of emergency funds, and investing in the stock market.  Getting a car would add at least $300/month to expenses (Gas, Insurance, saving for eventual maintenance costs). The other side of me is saying, get the car you want. Ford Fusion Energi and take advantage of the federal tax EV credit plus my state gives an EV credit as well. So I could save almost $5K on a car. And I would buy the car outright, no monthly car payments. 

What do y’all think, should I get a car?",1732162885.0

personalfinance,Pay off credit card or keep savings?,"Here’s the situation:
I have ~13k in credit card debt
Wife has ~9k in credit card debt
~12k in savings
~100k equity in our home

Goal: get cards paid off in most responsible way possible.

Note: I read a lot on this sub about changing spending behaviors, etc. We have hit some hard realizations in life recently that achieved this for us. We pay above the minimum payment every month, but I would just like to get rid of the balances ASAP.

I have a good credit score and can easily get a balance transfer card and have my CC debt paid off interest-free in the 18(ish) month time frame that the BT will give me.

My wife is less likely to get approved for a decent BT card, so I’m looking at other ways to get rid of her CC debt.

As mentioned, we currently have enough cash saved (roughly 12k) to pay off hers right now. This is also all the cash savings we have. We also own a home and have roughly $100k (at least) in equity. Was focused on getting a savings built up over the last couple years but am now realizing getting rid of the credit card balance is of the utmost concern.

Should we use the cash savings to pay off her debt and balance transfer mine, and then start using what we would have been paying for her monthly CC bill to start saving again?

Should I get a HELOC and pay it all off?

Something else I’m not considering?

Thanks for any and all input - i get a ton of help off this sub!

personalfinance,Should I invest monthly or pay off my student loans?,"I am in graduate school currently, and by the time I graduate in spring 2026, my fiancé and I will have \~$70k in total student loan debt ($20k my undergrad loans, $25k grad school loans, $25k her undergrad loans). My undergrad loans are at around 4.5% interest. My grad loans are at 8% interest, and her loans are on forbearance. All loans are federal loans.

Combined, we make about $220k pre tax. Our take home is roughly $10k, $2100 of which we invest in stocks, index funds, ETFs, IRAs, etc. Our mortgage payment is \~$2500. In a normal month, including investments, mortgage, etc., we spend about $8k, which allows us to save \~$2k in normal months. That being said, we bought a home and are getting married this year so we are quite cash poor (about $10k cash) relative to our income. I would love to have a 6 month emergency fund, continue investing, and be student loan free all at once but that is not likely any time soon. We were planning on paying $10k every year towards loans (in addition to the $213/month student loan payments we pay, but at this point that just negates the interest) once I graduate and would pay off all students loans within 6 years and have accrued $10k - $15k in interest. 

My question is, would it be more beneficial to stop investing and pay off student loans aggressively or continue to save and invest as we are currently doing and pay off $10k every year for 5-6 years?

personalfinance,Starting over after divorce ,"Hi! I’m 37f, divorced mother of 1 (11) trying to figure out how to plan for the future. I was a SAHM for 9 years while married and I’ve been busting my ass starting over for the last 2 years. Ex bought me out of the mortgage and with that money I paid off my car and lived off the rest while paying for school and life expenses. Got a degree, got a job, and now I feel like I’m finally on level ground but I’m also feeling increasingly overwhelmed in a whole new way.



Here is where I am at currently: 

Take home into my checking account is 4400/month. 

I put 5% into a Roth 401k and 5% into a Traditional 401k (and get a 5% employer match in the traditional), plus I’ve started putting 15% into a HYSA that is my emergency fund. These all get deducted from my check respectively and are already factored out of the amount above. 

The only debt I have is 4.5k remaining from a medical procedure that’s on a credit card since I went a year without insurance 🫠 oops 

Monthly expenses are only about 3k (rent, utilities, food, gas, etc) but my ex is out of work so I’ve been shouldering a lot more of our kiddos needs, so recently closer to 3.2-3.5k. Still a bit of room left to save though, and I’m willing to go more lean if it means padding for the future.



These are my questions: 

\- Should I continue to split between a Roth and Trad 401k? In my mind Roth is a better choice but I’m not confident on if that’s actually true which is why I split them. 

\- Should I use my HYSA to pay off the debt then rebuild that emergency fund? I only have 7500 in the HYSA. 

\- Should I switch to 10% into a HYSA and max out a Roth IRA? Or add an HSA?



Short term goal is to buy a house in 2025, credit score is 812, but I’m mostly worried about my low income holding me back on this. So it might not be possible, I might need to wait until I break six figures if I’m being honest with myself. 

Long term the dream is ‘retire’ by 55, but this is wholly dependent on maximizing my earnings potential while saving simultaneously, and is less than 20 years away…

My thought process is getting a vehicle with less than 50K miles so it has time before maintenance becomes an issue.    Getting a 2018 with 100K miles for $31K seems like I would be continuing a cycle of auto maintenance going forward.

At the moment I feel spending $5,500K for new head gaskets is the more sensible thing to do and continue to drive the 2008 Toyota.  

Financially we are somewhat stretched, we have 6 drivers in the family now and had to get vehicles for new drivers.   Basically purchase 3 cars in the last 3 years, so I am stretched.  We purchased new vehicles due to the fact that used vehicle prices have been and continue to be quite high.  ",1732146231.0
personalfinance,Which is better if you expect a lot of health issues. High premium or high deductible. ,"The math simply isn’t working out logically. 

There’s a strong possibility that I’ll have a lot of medical bills coming up. There’s also a possibility it could go pretty sideways medically. 

So I looked into a slightly better health plan with a lower deductible. But the premium, plus deductible, is actually more the max out of pocket cost of the high deductible plan. 

The only way this makes sense is if my whole family has a lot of health care expenses. That way at least one of them can enjoy an even lower deductible. 

But also, if it goes sideways, I’m going to have to come up with that max pretty early in the year.  Dragging it out with higher premiums feels like I’m paying a high interest loan on my health care that may or may not happen.

personalfinance,Is a Home Equity Loan Right for My Situation?,"I would like your opinion on my financial situation.

I (30m) have some credit card debt that I am looking to pay off as soon as possible.

* Card 1: $5,850 (27.49%)
* Card 2: $10,800 (15.74%)
* Card 3: $5,850 (21.74%)
* Card 4: $4,200 (27.49%)
* Card 5: $11,350 (0% APR expires in July 2025)
* Card 6: $19,600 (0% APR expires in April 2026)

I also have a student loan of $4,800 and a private loan from a family member of $80,000, both at 5%. The student loan payments are $60 a month, and the personal loan payments are $500 a month (although I would love to repay it faster).

I have a mortgage for a multi-unit house valued around $880,000 (according to Redfin), and I owe around $474,000. My mortgage is at 2.75%, 30 year fixed, and my monthly payment is around $3,300 (including taxes and insurance escrow).

My gross income from work is around $115,000 a year (plus a 7.5% target bonus), so I am getting around $2,700 every two weeks after deductions (8% for 401k contributions, insurance for me and my wife, and taxes). I am receiving $7,300 a month in rent payments.

I have to financially support my wife and my parents on this income. I can elaborate more as to why, but I would prefer to keep it outside of this discussion. We are working on getting a job for my wife, which should help our situation.

**Quick Summary**

Income:

* Work (net) $5,880
* Rent $7300

Expenses:

* Mortgage $3,300/month
* Rent $1020/month
* Utilities $400/month
* Food $1500/month
* Medical insurance for my father $1000/month
* Car insurance $170/month
* Gas $200/month
* Internet $80/month
* Cell phone (4 lines) $110/month

I have other expenses that vary from month to month. I am trying to be conscious about them, but it can be quite challenging, considering there are 3 other people I am paying for. Overall, I am estimating my total expenses be around $8,000 a month, on average.

I have a 401k with approximately $40,000 invested and no other significant savings.

Would a home equity loan be a good option for me? What amount do you think I could/should request and how big could the closing costs be? I am worried that my debt to income ratio could be too low. How would I go about estimating whether a home equity loan would be worth it over paying everything off one by one using the avalanche method? Are there any solutions I could be missing or are there any other questions that I should be asking?

It is an employee owned company that lets us buy stock at a 15% discount from the fair market price. When the price reaches around the low $30 mark they do a split. 

I looked at how often they do splits and it looks like roughly every 10 years. I get dividends at about $0.03 per share owned and I can keep all shares if I leave the company. 

With that said, not sure what the best thing to do is. I was between taking a loan and buying enough that a split or two would net me a nice retirement egg or just buying every week. 

Weekly I could comfortably buy a few shares, maybe like 5 at a price $20 without worrying about it. 

If I were to take out a loan I'm not entirely sure how much I would do. I could free up the same amount I would pay a week and do $400 a month for the loan payment.

personalfinance,"Whole life insurance, VUL policy or something else? ","Hi all,

Will try to be concise, when I was 20 I inherited a small amount of money from my moms passing. I knew nothing at all about finances then so under my dad’s pressuring we opened a whole life policy. I think at the time I invested somewhere around 15-20k maximum. Now, I’m nearly at the 20 year mark of the monthly payments so it’s almost at a point for it pays for itself but I am very concerned that about how low the returns are. It’s only guaranteed at 300k, which is a very low return given the amount of time. 

I spoke recently with the guy who handles the whole life policy , he says he’s a financial planner. He mentioned I could transfer tax free this 30k into a VUL type of insurance. The return rate averages about 10% so 20 years of regular contributions it looks like it would pay off quite nicely and it’s not taxed when it’s withdrawn. 

Also very important to note - I’m a U.S. citizen living and working for a European company in Europe. So due to the fact I don’t have a U.S. company or 1040 etc many other types of investing funds and tax advantage funds like an IRA, Roth IRA or 401k are not accessible to me. I’m also blocked from a lot of financial investments and funds where I live because I’m a U.S. person and banks / financial institutions don’t want the hassle of double declaring us to the IRS.

Any input or advice? Anyone try a VUL?

personalfinance,401k or Roth 401k? High but variable income ,"I am new (and late) to thinking of financial planning and taking personal finance seriously. I enrolled into my company 401k plan 5 1/2 years ago and haven't really thought much about it until now. 

My company matches up to 3% and offers a 401k and Roth 401k option. I have personal savings but aside from this 401k I have no other retirement or investment accounts. I put 13% of my income into the 401k and my company matches 3%. I have a value of about $143k in there now, all invested in a target date fund 2060 (automated, I just learned what this what) I am an account executive and being in sales my income can fluctuate but either way I still earn a decent salary. 75k base and OTE is 216k although I don't always hit that. 

2022 income- 130k (bad year) 
2023 income- 202k 
2024- likely to hit around 175/180k 

My question are.. what would be the best strategy for me given what I already have in place and my variable income? Should I keep the 401k or switch to Roth 401k? My company will match either. Should I max what I have and then get a personal IRA to contribute too? I'll be honest and say I could afford to be saving more.

I got married this year and was unaware of the income limits for Roth IRA. We also have a FIL stay with us. Does his income figure in to our MAGI number?

Just with the two of us, our combined income puts us relatively close but I don’t know how close. I can’t find a very clear cut way to calculate MAGI. I’ve almost maxed out my IRA for the year already. How and when would I even find out if I was in violation? 

If I am able to somehow find out how to calculate the MAGI number and we are over the limit, am I able to fix it somehow before I get penalized? 

I know back door IRA is the way to go if I need to change strategies due to the limits. I can look that up in depth later if I need to. I do not have a traditional IRA, but do have a pre-tax 403(b) and two employees 401Ks for which I don’t know if they are pre- or post-tax.

personalfinance,Trying to decide which ACA insurance plan makes the most sense for me - A cheaper HDHP that isn't HSA eligible or a more expensive one that is?,"I am a mix of part-time and self employed, and have been able to take advantage of the ACA for years. A couple years ago I got turned on to an HSA as really more of an investment tool, so for the last two years I've had a HDHP that was HSA eligible through Blue Cross Blue Shield and have been making small monthly contributions to it.

Unfortunately, for next year there is literally only one HSA eligible plan, and it's not with BCBS but with Aetna. I don't like the idea of switching to a different provider, but it appears I don't have a choice if I want to keep contributing to my HSA. Here are things by the numbers:

My alloted tax credit is $434.

The price of a HDHP with BSBS is $351 per month with $7000 deductible.

The price of the HSA eligible Aetna plan is $428.57 with $5695 deductible.

I contribute roughly $60-$80 a month to my HSA. I have about $1200 in it currently and if I get it to $2000 I can invest it.

My tax credit would cover either plan, but I like to still pay a handful of dollars out of pocket. So by sticking to BCBS I could save close to $100 each month that I would get back as a refundable tax credit, versus like $100 for the whole year.

My question is, would it make more financial sense to stick with BCBS for next year and just not worry about my HSA? Should I dump enough money into my HSA to get it over $2000 before the year is out so it can be invested?",1732136388.0

personalfinance,Just moved to the US. Help me decide between VT & VTI/VXUS for my long term investing. How much will I forego by picking VT?,"

Hello,

I’m 36 and currently relocated to Texas.

So I was in Canada for the past 10 years and had most of my money (~$100k) invested in a Canadian TFSA (tax free savings account) in a 2-fund portfolio of VT & BNDW (90:10).

I liquidated my TFSA and moved permanently to the US last month since I got my greencard, and these funds are now lying around in my US bank account that I need to invest immediately into my newly opened taxable brokerage (Fidelity).

Since I prefer simplicity, I was thinking of just doing 100% VT again (ditching bonds this time as many people said you don’t need bonds at this age) despite the slightly higher ER and lack of tax credits, but since I expect this amount to grow, I’m wondering if it’s still a good idea? How much money in tax credits will I be foregoing every year by doing this?

Also - a lot of people prefer overweighting US and doing 80% VTI & 20% VXUS, and I’ve personally been seeing VTI consistently outperforming VT, so I’m wondering if it’s better to go this route instead and simply allocate every new investment in a 80/20 ratio?

so recently i got a new job - and have options on choosing my healthcare, so i am trying to budget and decide which is best and wanted some advice on my thought process.

So - im coming from a job where my insurance was garbage, no option. Just one plan (small company so im guessing insurance companies didnt really care about having them as a customer).

I am not too familiar with the US insurance system so its all very confusing for me.  

Now my insurance offers 3 plans.

The HDHP - costs me $0:     
$4k deductible,   
$4k out of pocket  
Cosinurance is 100% - so basically i pay everything until i meet my $4k deductible, but then i pay nothing. 

They have a PPO which is $55 per month, this is their highest tier:  

$1.2k deductible,     
out of pocket $4.2k    
Coinsurance is 20% after meeting my deductible      
Appointments are 20% paid by me.   
prescriptions are $15 copay with a $50 deductible     

Consumer Choice Plan CCP is $37 per month which is the middle option:    

deductible $3.2k,       
Coinsurance is 20% after meeting my deductible    
out of pocket 4.7k   
My company will contribute $600 per year into my HSA   
Appointments are 20% paid by me.      
 prescriptions:  20% after deductible      
   
So here is my logic:

Now, on the one hand - i have been a pretty healthy although im now getting older (basically 40s now). I had a ruptured disc a few years ago, and lets just say i can feel my body getting older. 

For the longest time if i had options i would go on the HDHP, and i would just save the money for a rainy day.

However, this is the first time the top tier insurance policy has been relatively cheap (its 672 for the year, but as its pre-tax the actual cost according to my calculations would be 465. Because the -660 spent on medical insurance would slightly lower my taxable income. 

$465 per year equates to $39 per month. 

Which in the grand scheme of things im thinking is pretty good to have peace of mind that routine visits are covered, prescriptions have higher coverage etc. 

 Many times over the years i have resisted going to the doctors because i am paying 100% until my deductible is met. 

The CCP is $444 per year, but after taxes have been taken into account it would cost me $312 per year (26 per month). 


So i guess in a nutshell:

1) Go with HDHP and save $465 per year and save more money to account for emergencies?   

2) Go with PPO and get the best coverage and be a little safer, and spend $465 per year for coverage.   

3) Middle of the road option, CCP, spend $312 per year, but get $600 back from my employer into an HSA for medical expenses. Net gain of $288 per year.    

My heads spinning as i am not used to US insurance and its just all so confusing.",1732130912.0
personalfinance,"$4k credit card debt, $4k in hard cash. $22/hour job. NEED CAR ASAP","22 M. I got kicked out of my parents house. Exhausted all friends houses, no relatives to stay with. I'm on my own. Not here to weep. Just explaining my situation so I can get the proper help.

I have a job that pays $22 an hour. I've been trying to get a car so I can uber and live out of it for a little so I can pay off my credit cards and save money.

I want a toyota or honda used around 120k miles, \~8k-10k. I found some that are good. I'd rather pull out a loan for something more reliable I can do uber with and make the money back, instead of spending my last $4k on a janky car that I couldn't even make money out of. Also something I could keep for a couple of years.

  
I'm cool with being in the hole for a little, as long as I have something reliable. I have a credit union through my job at target but interest rates are horrible, it was looking like 8.19% for a 6 year term for a 2014 toyota camry with 128k miles. 

I don't really know what to do. If I can get a good car loan, I'm fine with sleeping in my car, (obviously keeping it clean for passengers). I can save money, work my job and do uber on the side, pay off my credit card debt, save my money, and then save up and build my credit to get a good apartment I enjoy.

personalfinance,Is there I can do about a potentially unethical 401k setup?,"**Most 401Ks I've Seen:**

* They offer at least 1 low expense ratio fund/index
* They are fairly easy to roll over into a 401k or IRA

**Prior Employer's Ascensus 401k:**

It only offers high expense ratio funds and it's very hard to roll over:

* Requesting a rollover first requires the participant to set up a notary appointment to notarize the rollover agreement (with an additional witness who also needs to take off work).
* That notarized document must be faxed to Ascensus (they only accept fax) - there no way to verify they received it since all requests go to one number & you receive no confirmation from them.
* My experience (and the experience of a friend who also tried to roll it over but gave up) has been sending the fax multiple times and being told multiple times they don't see it on their side.
* If you are lucky and they process it (which takes a few weeks), you will be given a short window to make the rollover happen due to an Ascensus policy that the notary agreement only unlocks the rollover option for a short window.
* You are not notified when it is processed, so you need to be checking your 401k portal frequently to see if they did it or not to not miss your rollover request window.
* Once processed you can request a check be mailed to you (unlike many 401k providers there is no option to do this online, it must be mailed via check).
* However if you moved you need update your address which by policy locks your account for weeks
* The locking of your account means your notary letter is no longer valid due to the above policy where the letter is only valid for rollovers for a short while
* So you need to restart with faxing a new notarized agreement
* Also at any point if you call and you don't the exact date you were hired off hand they lock your account for weeks as that is one of the (automated) verification questions.

**Why this may be unethical:**

They make a killing on your money sitting in high expense ratio funds (they do not offer low expense funds), so they have a financial stake in setting up a system that intentionally makes that money hard to roll over.",1732127479.0

personalfinance,Stuck with a car that I owe more than what its worth.,"for starters, I am completely aware that this was a poor financial decision on my part so please spare me the life lessons haha.

Buckle up, its a long one.

  
I purchased a 2016 ford focus from a ""buy here pay here"" dealer back in 2022. the car i was trading in had taken a dump and i worked in 2 hours that day so i was in a rush to leave with a car off the lot as quick as possible. I didn't fully look over every part of every document, and when the words ""salvaged title"" were brought up, I had no idea what it meant. I willingly signed  for this car with $1045 down. 

  
I left the lot and immediately got a ""oil change requested"" notif on my dash, but ignored it because again, I had to work in 2 hours. The first few weeks were great, no problems whatsoever. I took it to get regularly serviced, tires rotated, all that good stuff. 

  
Then, maybe about 8 months or so later, my driver side strut needed to be replaced as well as some ither suspension components. They took care of it but kept my car overnight, and when i picked it up I noticed the entire interior of my car was COVERED in dirt, like if a sand storm rolled in and the windows were down. So I went back in there and complained and they informed me that they are not responsible for anything that happens to a vehicle while its on their lot. I expressed to them that they should have kept the windows up because its in a bad part of town and there are stray animals as well. They reassured me it wouldn't happen again.

  
A few months go by, maybe 2, and my transmission goes out completely. I'm stuck on the service road of the highway and had to get the car towed back to the dealer so they could fix it for me. They told me that it was under warranty and that I didn't have to pay anything, but that my transmission went out because there was no fluid. But mind you, about 3 weeks prior to that I had brought it in to get the fluids checked and topped off so there's no way it would've been bone dry if they just filled it up with trans fluid and there wasn't a leak either. So they lied about either topping off my fluid, or it went out for another reason. Regardless, they fix it. I go to get my car when its done and sure enough, they left the windows down again and there are cat paw prints EVERYWHERE and my car smelled like cat piss. of course i take pictures, walk my ass back in there and complain all over again and they tell me the same thing as before. 

  
7 months later, my transmission goes out again. This time I'm furious because there's no reason i should be purchasing another transmission this soon. I bring it back to them, and they keep it for a few days and I'm thinking they're working on it the whole time, come to find out they were waiting for an estimate because THIS time, they wanted me to pay $2500 for them to replace it. I go back and forth with the service manager and she keeps telling me ""well how about we split it half and half"" I'm not covering half at ALL because they put a USED faulty transmission in when they didn't give me the option to purchase a new one. So she declines. I then report them to the BBB because I felt i had been sold a lemon. The service manager agrees to replace the transmission free of charge, but get this, she BANS ME from bringing it back to get serviced there. So i ignore it, it it what it is. 

  
I leave with my car, and later that night I'm driving somewhere and my car starts SMOKING like crazy. I pull over. pop the hood and see that there is oil everywhere. I turned the car back on to see where its coming from, and its spitting oil from the valve cover so i immediately knew it was the valve cover gasket. I manage to get it home and I'm replacing it the next day and i find that someone took one of the gasket pieces off and shoved it into a part of my engine bay. it seemed absolutely intentional. after being banned because i reported them to the BBB, this happens? its not a coincidence. so i fix it myself and i leave it alone.

According to AZ state guidelines, my car doesn't fall under the lemon law therefore nobody will take my case. One attorney informed me of an arbitration procedure that happened against Ford in 2020, with the exact transmission i have. Same symptoms and everything. So i spend about a month and a half of my time going through the full procedure so that i can do a buyback from Ford. I submit every single service order for the transmission, I provide everything they need. And after the interview with the arbitrator, they deny me because Ford only has record of me replacing the trans ONCE. Not twice. So either they didnt report it, or they didnt fully replace it I have no idea. Regardless, i am still stuck with this car.

  
Now, i currently owe about $4,700 left on this $20,000 loan, and I've been looking around trying to get someone to let me trade it in because its not worth it at all. It has a salvaged title, so my MAX offers have been around $1500 at the most which isn't enough to buy me out of the loan. Yesterday, I completed a credit app and was informed that this 20k auto loan isn't reflecting on all credit bureaus so essentially its not positively affecting me whatsoever. But if it gets repoed, THEN that will show up on my credit but all this progress I've been making has really been for nothing.

personalfinance,Can we afford to move?,"Hi- turning to Reddit to help solve an argument (that’s always good, right?🤦‍♀️). Can we afford to move? I don’t have all the exact numbers so I’m going to overestimate expenses and underestimate income.

My husband and I are in our 30s. We own a 3 bed/2 bath house and that worked when we had 1 child but now we have 3 and I want to move to a larger house. We don’t have a very expensive lifestyle and we definitely avoid debt. We have just over $18,000 left to pay off on our house. The Zillow estimate for our house is $350,000. Not sure about the accuracy of Zillow estimates, but that’s the number. We have no other debt. All of our vehicles are paid off. We have credit cards, but we treat them as debit cards and never carry a balance.

As far as income, he is the primary income. His pre-tax base pay is $125,000 but he has the option of working overtime and he does sometimes and he gets a yearly performance bonus. My income is more variable. I work part time on weekends so we don’t have to pay for childcare. I had a baby this year so I didn’t work for 3 months but I’m on track to bring in $16,050. We fully contribute to retirement, we have 529 plans for each of our kids, and we have savings.

As an example, I’m looking at new construction that’s $560,000. If we can net $300,000 from our current house and use that as a down payment, a mortgage calculator shows me that at 6.77% our monthly payment would be less than $2,200. This current builder is advertising lower rates if we finance through them and when I plug that in, it shows an estimated monthly payment of $1,873/month. 

Can we afford this? If I bring this up, my husband looks at me like I’m crazy. He says I have no idea how expensive it is to move on top of “doubling” what we pay now (our current mortgage payment is $1,200 which I think is really reasonable). It’s true, this is our first house so I have never gone through the process of selling a house. Am I being unreasonable thinking we could afford to do something like this?

But what does ""with a cap at 4% match"" mean? Is that just additional, redundant explanation? Because ""50% of employee contributions up to 8%"" already implies they'll contribute up to 4%.

Or does it mean something else?",1732124202.0
personalfinance,Heloc - signed closing documents ,"So to make a long story short, I have some debt and also need home repairs. The carpets are lifting, there’s exposed nails in the floors, and I have a toddler that walks around all day. 

I’m the sole provider at the moment, and my finance is a SAHM. Currently with the economy today, and with just my income alone, we are staying afloat paycheck to paycheck. But we also need some home repairs and she thought it was a good idea to look into refinancing and that’s when I ran across Helocs as an option only because my rate currently is at 3% and don’t want to lose it. I obviously did some research before reaching out to the lender. It sounded good at first.  Yes, I know it’s a bad idea to consolidate debt with more debt. I knew it. But the pressures of my wife on me about it, and the constant stress, so I jumped and signed the docs WHILE at work. Literally less than 24 hours lol. 

So yeah. I locked in and honestly, the rate is too embarrassing to even list. I guess my only questions is, can I even back out now that I signed the docs or do I just let it sit? If I ever decide to use a HELOC, I want to make sure it’s not for debt consolidation and it’s for like, an emergency repair or something. After I signed the documents at work, I deep dived hard on reddit because It’s literally making me anxious.

personalfinance,How much should I aim to have to early retire and be able to live comfortably?,"I'm not looking to live extravagantly.  I have a lot of assets and a bit of debt.  I'm wondering if we could simply sell off some things and stop working and still be able to get by.

We're 38 and have two children (2 and 4).  They're likely to be our biggest money sink, but we don't need to save for their college or anything like that.  Just typical costs associated with raising them.

We currently own some land, worth about $90,000.  It has some food trucks that rent from us.  I might be willing to keep this since the time commitment is minimal.  We spend about $500/mo on utilities and bring in about $1,400/mo in rent.

We have our house, which is maybe worth $320,000 and includes a retail space attached.  Currently we're running a coffee shop out of it ourselves but that's a nuisance.  We break even and maybe make a little money off of it, but it takes a lot of our time to manage.  If we closed it up, we might be able to rent the space for $800 to $1200 per month.  The house and this retail space is worth about $320,000 but we have about $150,000 left on the mortgage.  The rates are whatever current rates are, so they change.  Recently went up to like 6% but I think dropped a little recently.

We also have a $36,000 car we bought in 2021.  Not sure how much is left on the loan there but the APR is fixed 2.9%.  

We have about $300,000 in stocks, $200,000 in crypto and maybe $70,000 in stocks via IRAs.

My wife works, and I do freelance work and manage the business some.  Our goal would be to get away from working as soon as we can, though I might still freelance occasionally which would maybe be about $12,000/year since I wouldn't want to do it full time.

So at what point could we maybe call it quits?  What steps should we take to get there?",1732123685.0
personalfinance,Does it make sense to move in this scenario?,"
My partner and I live in Tampa (a M/HCOL area) in a 3/2 single-family home we rent for $1740/month base rent, around $2050 with utilities. Our landlord raised our renewal rate to $2000 base/$2300 with utilities, but when we said we wouldn’t renew, they dropped it back down to $1700 base rent. We have a deadline to decide whether to sign the renewal.  

We found a new rental, a 2/1 that’s half the space but significantly cheaper: $1300/month or $1400/month with January rent free. The issue is the new lease starts December 15th, and they won’t push back the start date. They also require first month’s rent, a security deposit, and a pet fee upfront—$3000 total.  

Our current lease ends January 28th, and since we paid first/last/security when we moved in, January would technically be free, but we’d still owe full rent for December. With no savings, paying rent on both places for December isn’t feasible.  

The new rental would save us $700+ a month, which is huge, and other 2/1 rentals in the area cost much more. However, we’d need to downsize quickly, and our current 3/2 is a great deal for the location.  

For context:
- I net $4000/month and gross $75,000/year.
- My partner makes $3700/month base but earns overtime regularly.  He makes around $50,000 a year.
- We hope to save for a house within a year or so.

personalfinance,[x-Post /debtfree] Debt Resolution and Employee ESPP Plan,"Hey guys,

Posted here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfree/comments/1gvtn1n/debt\_resolution\_and\_employee\_espp\_plan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfree/comments/1gvtn1n/debt_resolution_and_employee_espp_plan/)

But looking for perspectives in different communities.

Hoping this is the right sub to ask...

Somewhat interesting question. Never posted here, and posting on a second account. I'm currently 50k in debt, with all the loans, credit cards that I've cumulated over the years. We bought a house, and the house had undisclosed issues that needed a few loans to take on, and I'm taking on all these loans myself.

I have a house, and a car, so I really have no need for any major financial purchases in the next couple years. And if I make a major purchase, I want to be in a position to just pay most of it off with cash if not the entire amount.

I work for a company that has a very good Employee Stock Purchasing plan, that has a 2 year look back period, and has been doing very well. Buying a stock would be roughly $105 for me, in which selling at roughly 400. Every 6 months the employer takes the money I put into it, buys all my stock at the discount and then I can sell right away. This looks like essentially a 3x-4x my money minus taxes.

With the combination of me wanting to get out of debt, not really caring about credit purchases, and the ESPP plan, I've been thinking about holding off on making payments to my debters an focusing those payments 100% on the ESPP plan. I'm already doing 5% of my check, but I can't do more because I'm paying into my debts. The plan is to instead invest that money into the ESPP to which I can sell 3-4x in 6 months, then just come in with one fell swoop and pay everyone off. To put into perspective I pay roughly $1500 a month in payments just to debt alone. I'd continue to pay on my mortgage, and my car note, but aside from that I could be looking at $2000 a month into ESPP. payments, including what I currently contribute now. This would be roughly 30-40k in optimistic income in which I get other financial insentives vested to pay the rest off.

This would destroy my credit. But I truly don't need any major purchases at the moment. I need either some advice, different perspectives. This seems like a 'too good to be true' situation.

29m, married, 2 kids. HH income 180k (me 140, her 40). After all bills/expenses, savings for birthdays/vacations/christmas/etc. plus retirement savings (~$4k/mo: 1 401k + 2 roths; wife doesn’t have access to 401k), we have about $3k/mo leftover that just goes into an hysa (about $60k, yes I know it’s wasteful to not invest everything over emergency fund amount). Own a home w/ mortgage at 3%, no other debt. Net worth around $500k (roughly 100k house equity, 400k from cash and retirement)

However, also don’t want to do something I’d come to regret. I’m looking mostly at used/new Honda/acura/lexus (not a fan of current gen Toyotas). 

I like the savings of a used car but better rates, warranty, first owner entices me to spend extra on new. And another extension of that, I heavily appreciate quality, so that’s why Lexus/acura are in consideration even with their further higher price.

I'm not gonna go into detail on the reasons I wasn't able to save for my taxes because it's a long list of bullshit (but not *really* bs lol). Just know I have tried to save for them for the time I've done 1099 work knowing full well I'll have to pay my own. I just lost my 2nd 1099 job for reasons out of my control and am probably not gonna do anymore 1099 if I can avoid it so I don't dig myself into deeper debt, because I obviously haven't been able to take care of the tax part and *also* just feel like I don't know enough about deductions and what not to be able to file well for the max amount of money to be saved from Uncle Sam's nasty clutches.

\- Live 8 miles away (20 min commute) from work with one of my coworkers for $1450 per month + utilities.

\- Live at home with my parents 28 miles away from work and pay close to nothing in rent, just helping out with a few bills/groceries. The commute cuts across LA so it's significantly longer. Luckily my manager allowed me to come a little later (\~10 AM) to arrive when traffic isn't *as* bad. This would make the commute 45-50 min.

I'm conflicted since the first option seems very cheap for LA rent. At the end of the day though, I could be living at home doing virtually the ""same"" drive and saving over $1700 on rent + other hidden costs like groceries, etc. Gas would be tough, but luckily I drive an EV and can charge at home or work for relatively cheap. I feel like it's coming down to preference at this point. I already drive home \~25 miles almost every other weekend to see friends and family, this would cut that drive out at least.

personalfinance,Question regarding Roth vs. Traditional IRA when income will be changing...? ,"I have tried to look through the wiki but this is a pretty specific situation so I am not sure what to do.

I recently graduated at 32 and I am in a specialty medical field field with high earning potential. I bought a private practice and right now my gross income is projected to be about 180k. This income is considered very low for my field but since I just bought the practice and there are lots of one time expenses I am paying myself relatively low as a W2 employee of my business to build up capital in the business. My combined gross HH income with my husband will be about 230k but I have no idea what it will be as ""adjusted"" since I do have student loan interest etc. I have about 465k in student loans.

I am trying to figure out the best way to start contributing for my retirement. I don't have a 401k since I am a small business owner. My income is currently under the limit to contribute maximum to a Roth IRA but it will increase to over the limit by next year or the year after most likely.

I have read the wiki regarding the differences between Roth and Traditional and normally I feel like a smart person but this makes me feel dumb. Should I contribute max to a Roth right now and then when my income increases contribute to traditional? I started reading about backdoor and got even more confused.

Can someone ELI5 or point me towards more resources to learn more about this? I am setting up a meeting with my accountant but just wanted to gain some insight before that.

personalfinance,Saving for college from inheritance in current climate,"Due to recent family deaths, my son has inherited some money. He is 11. The first inheritance is a monthly payment and we've set that up to transfer into a 529 that was opened for this purpose. We were not saving for his college before this. At age 18 he gets control of that monthly payment and will have about 6.5 years of it left. 

He also got a $10k inheritance that we've finally gotten the payment for. The initial plan was to also put it into the 529. Based on various 529 calculators, the 529 would provide enough to pay for about half of his college at a state school. 

Since this is inherited money, the usual suggestion to fund my retirement first is not a factor. 

My question is, in the current climate and what changes might be coming, both for investing and education, is the 529 still a good place to put that $10k? Should I be considering something else?

Last week, I received an email saying the funds were automatically withdrew and a check was in the mail to me. It seems that my account did not have enough funds to stay open, so they shut it. 

I received the check in the mail with a stub of information. 

Gross Amount: $891.36
Net/Check Amount: $859.83

Both Fed and St tax was taken out: $31.53

Below where it mentions all of that info, it has a section for tax reporting. This is where I am extremely confused. I was under the impression I would have 60 days to rollover the check into my Roth IRA or my current 401k. So I am wondering why taxes were already taken out? And also if it would make sense at this point to even roll it into my 401k if state and federal taxes were taken out when a 401k is pre-tax? If that is the case, then how would I rollover the amount into my Roth IRA if I already maxed it out for the 2024 year, so I cannot contribute more to it? Would I have to open a new IRA just to avoid the tax penalty that I assume I would still have to pay on my taxes next year? 

Within the tax reporting section it also mentions that there is an eligible amount for rollover which was the gross amount mentioned above. How can I roll over the gross amount when the check amount is not that amount?

personalfinance,Is HSA a better deal?,"I am turning 26 later this week, and recently just had  my first child, with my wife going part-time as a nurse to stay home with the baby. As a result, I will need to sign up for some form of family health insurance during my open enrollment, which is currently going on now. I am considering either normal PPO or HSA, and kind of leaning towards HSA. Details are as follows:

PPO:
Premium: $487.28 (we get paid 2x a month)
Deductible: $0 if using Mercy network, which we use for all doctors and hospitals when possible. 20% coinsurance on hospital services and $10-$25 copay on different types of physician visits, free preventative care

HSA:
Premium: $369.99
Deductible: $3,300 family, $1,650 individual (will explain importance later), then 0% coinsurance after deductible is met (only medication copays would apply, which are the same on either plan). 
Free preventative care or teladoc

My work contributes $1,000 in seed money and matches the first $500 I contribute. So my thoughts are, if I choose HSA and contribute the difference between the 2 premium options, I would be putting in $2,815 into the HSA, + the $1500 from my work, would result in $4300, enough to pay up to the deductible and have some left over. 

Additionally, my wife is a type 1 diabetic. The individual deductible is important because once that  is satisfied by any individual on the plan, the plan begins covering all their expenses. So with her Continuous glucose monitor + pump + related supplies + insulin, she would hit the individual deductible pretty early into the year. 

My question is, am I overlooking anything that I should consider into making my decision? And also, if I pay the same amount each month (by contributing the difference into the HSA), is there any additional tax savings? Since PPO premiums are pretax as well?

Here is the details breakdown in case I forgot to mention anything important:

personalfinance,Advice on using trust fund money,"Not sure if I’ll get answers to all my questions here, but hoping I can gain a little insight.

I had an injury at birth due to medical negligence. My parents sued the doctor and settled out of court. So far I’ve received 4 annual payments of $40,000 each that started when I was 18. This money was primarily used to pay for my college tuition, and I feel *extremely* lucky to not have student loans like the majority of people I know do. Judging by how much my tuition was, I’d conservatively estimate that there’s about $50,000 left in my account. The next payments are set to begin when I turn 25. I’ll be getting 4 payments of approximately $250,000 every 5 years until I turn 40. I’m just curious as to how I should use the money as it comes along. I’m already investing in a Roth, though that has been exclusively with my own money from working. I’m definitely planning to use the first $250k payment to put a down payment on a house, but beyond that I’m honestly sort of lost. As of now, I’m thinking some more investment accounts, real estate (either as a rental or personal vacation home use, or both) and obviously regular savings.

The money was set up by the attorney to be held in and paid out from a Supplemental/Special Needs Trust managed by my parents. I’ve heard the main advantage of this type of trust is that it enables the beneficiary to still continue to collect government benefits, provided you spend the money on a very strict list of necessities. I collect no benefits, so I *assume* that I can really spend the money on anything I want/need since I’m not being audited/monitored for benefit eligibility.

My debt ultimately started with the memestonk debacle back in 2021, margin call, etc etc. My investing now is simply buying shares of market ETFs and I learned my lesson there.

I used to make about around $80k in 2020 / 2021, then $100-$105k a year for the last few years before I got my new job in September for a pay bump up to $150k. Unfortunately, I joined a startup and to be honest the future of the company is rather up in the air. Which comes up in my options below. The new company is ending their 401k match at EOY.

I keep track of all of my expenses from my shared and personal credit card on an excel document, so I have a good sense of where the money is going by category each month. We don't eat out more than a couple times a month, and I think we're done with travel until about April or so. I try to be frugal wherever possible but I also don't want to have this ruin my life and turn to living like I used to during college etc.

So, I think my options are:

1. Withdraw enough from my 401k/IRA to cover my credit card debt - which I think is the lowest stress option for me now and gives me a fresh start to contribute a lot to my IRA/401k down the line. Yes, I will take a big hit on my retirement savings but I am now earning a lot more and would be able to contribute more monthly with my debt being gone.

2. Roll my old 401k into my current 401k, and take a loan out on it to pay off my CC debt at a 9% interest rate - the problem here is if the company goes under, or gets acquired, or if I get fired, that amount is due within 90 days, or I have to then pay the tax penalties as if I just withdrew it.

3. Debt consolidation loan - I've been getting far too many emails and calls harassing me after trying to look for a loan here. General specs would be $1,800 a month for 2 years (14.7%), $1,300 a month for 3 years (15.3%, $1,000 for 4 years (16.2%). The other APRs don't seem to make sense given where my current balance APR is at. I'm leaning away from doing the 2 year because that is a huge monthly payment. The 3 or 4 year payments seem more palatable given my expenses but still very unsure about this option.

4. Sell my car to put a big dent in the capital one balance, then try to control spending and pay down the Capital One balance first, but in April I'll start getting interest charged on the BofA balance, and will need to strategize after that. Capital One has offered a year of 0% on balance transfers, and I'm seeing how long that will last before transferring my BofA balance there.

5. I suppose I could also zero out my 401k contributions, zero out brokerage contributions and pay it down that way, but I’m eating interest payments. 

Are there other options I should be considering?

Should I just take the risk to take the 401k loan out, and do a big enough loan to keep enough to cover the taxes in my brokerage etc if something bad does happen with my job and I have to pay the penalties? I could take a \~$45k loan from my 401k, pay off my two balances and then stash the rest in my post-tax brokerage account in something stable, just in case I have to pay off the taxes and penalty if I get fired / the company goes under.

Part of me feels confident in making enough money in the future where I want to just take the taxes and penalties from taking out enough from my 401k, just to wipe everything out and have my mind at ease. No credit hit either.

personalfinance,401k loan - is it the answer?,"29 y/o, $100k salary, $100k 401k balance. 10% employer match. 

Looking to take a 401k loan for $20,000 to “refinance” one of my existing loans. 

The numbers show this reducing my current monthly payment by ~$100 AND shaving off 2yrs of the loan. 

The loan in question has a 10% interest rate currently with a payoff date of 11/2030. 

The 401k loan has an interest rate of 8%, paid back to myself, and would be paid off 11/2028.

With my age, salary, generous employee match, and the interest paid back to myself, why shouldn’t I take the loan? 

Seems like a no brainer as I have plenty of time to rebound my account before retirement? I may be biased, but I also feel like compared to my peers I have 3x+ the amount saved for retirement at our ages. 

Open to criticism. Pros and cons. I want to hear it all. Because this seems really hard to pass up each day I think about it.

personalfinance,Laid off: What to do with 401k?,"My wife was laid off and we don't know what to do about her 401k?

**BACKGROUND:**  

We're in our mid/late 50's and we were hoping she'd be able to retire in 2-3 years (I'll keep working for another 10 years or so).  Obviously with her income going from pretty decent to zero puts a wrinkle in the plans as we just don't have enough saved and living solely off my income will be tight but possibly doable (I'm self employed, so I don't have a 401k or pension).

Besides the modest size 401k, we both have an IRA that we opened 3 years ago (1 is pre-tax, one is post-tax = because we had no clue what we were doing).  The IRAs have preformed amazingly well, but even so, the total dollar amount isn't huge (the contribution's were capped, and there has only been 3 years of contributions, though at our ages I think we put in a little more than someone younger could have).

We have a pretty low COL and aren't material/money driven (which is good in that we don't need a ton of money to live on, but bad in that we don't have a ton saved up either).  With our ""retirement funds"" (401k + IRAs + Savings) I estimate that we currently have about half of what we need to get by on in retirement.  

Our plan had been for both of us to continue working and to continue to max 401k and IRA contributions for 2-3 more years (at which point we'd hoped to have our house paid off and our kids be financially self sufficient).  Then she'd retire and we'd live off my income for another 7-8 years until we both hit 65, with the hope/thinking that that money saved would grow some over those years without us having to put more into it (thus giving us a much more comfortable retirement, especially if it came close to doubling over those years).  But now with her income zero, it changes things. 

I'll also note that at her age she doesn't want (nor does she think she can get) a corporate job like she had, and ideally would like a fairly ""low stakes"" position (part time would be ideal to try out partial retirement, but we may need her to work full time just to gain access to healthcare) and thus likely she will be making about half of what she used to.  Month to month that should be OK (assuming Obamacare isn't too expensive if she doesn't get a full time job) but it will limit (to zero?) how much we can support the kids and likely we won't be able to add any to our retirement funds.

**QUESTIONS:**

1. Do we leave the 401k where it's at (and I assume pay the company some sort of management fee)?
2. Do we move it to one of our IRAs?  And if so, do we have a choice of which one?  (I think hers is the post-tax one but I'd have to double check)
3. If we have a choice, is Fidelity or Charles Schwab a better choice?  (my IRA is at Fidelity, hers is at Schwab)
4. For years we've maintained keeping 6 months of living money in a savings account (with crap yield, but it's our safety net/emergency fund).  With the upcoming year and all the unknowns, we're unsure if digging into that to make IRA contributions is something we're comfortable with, so likely won't contribute anything.  Is that dumb?  Our kids are both fairly recent college grads with low paying jobs and we still help them financially a decent amount.  1 lives in a MCOL area and is pretty close to being able to live off her own income, but the other is on the East coast in a HCOL area and she doesn't make much more than minimum wage (plus she's applying to grad schools, so her expenses may go way up while her income goes down some).
5. Sort of related:  At what age do parents stop helping their children financially?  Neither of our parents helped us at all past 18, but we're trying to help our kids avoid the struggles we went through.  Our plan has always been to help as much as we can (which was a decent amount) up until they're 26 (and forced off our health insurance, which seemed like a good age to plant the flag at).  We don't want them stressing about our finances, nor do we want them to get into a pinch and us not be able to help them.  So how do (decent) parents handle the financial ""separation""?

We've got about 647 more questions, but at the moment those are the ones we feel the most worried about.

Thanks and I appreciate any/all advice!

personalfinance,Need guidance on future investments (Car + Bills),"Hi, I just turned 18 a few months ago and I finally was able to get a job, I’ve been training and should hopefully start working full time by next week. I don’t have many people to talk to about finances, and I would like to handle things as best as possible. I currently don’t have a car, but I am going to be putting all my savings from work towards a car, and I’ve found one for $5,600 ($6,300 after fees, taxes, etc), and I also want to start investing in savings accounts (ROTH’s, multifaceted investment accounts, daily investing, possible trading). I know I’m not providing a lot, but I just don’t even know what to share to get advice. I would like to get a car as soon as possible, I have nearly no money saved, and it would open up my life a lot more, so that’s why I’m prioritizing it, as well as the fact that I only have a few months before it gets cold and rainy, and I won’t be able to commute to work easily without a car (bike/public transportation commute around 1.2 hours, with a car it’s 20 minutes). I don’t know anything about loans, and I’m pretty scared to have absolutely any debt for fear of not having enough to pay it back before the interest causes me to pay even more, like I’ll never be able to pay it off. But would it be a smart financial decision to try and opt for a loan? Either now, or maybe after I save $3,000 or $5,000? I want to be able to afford the car and pay it off quickly, and my main issues are these two. 1) If I get a loan sooner, and get the car, the loan will be a lot bigger, needing $6,000 or so, it would make work commute much easier, and allow for more flexibility, but I would need to pay monthly for insurance, the loan, gas, and other car expenses, which may make it difficult to feel comfortable with my savings/income. 
Or, option 2) I can try and work as much as possible before the weather gets worse, which the work isn’t hard, but I chance a lot of risk having to ride a bike upwards of 20-30 miles daily, which is mentally and physically exhausting, and I would be doing it nearly everyday, but it lets me save money for a car. I could make maybe around half the car price, $3,200 estimate, in maybe a month to two months? Would that be a better idea to get a small loan with less interest and less to pay back?

personalfinance,Need help with my finances. I'm only able to save $200 combined in October and November if I proceed with my purchases. How should I go about this?,"I have about 100k in cash right now. This year I've saved up around 22k so far. I usually try to save up 2k a month but it's not working these last two months. 

Last month I got 

\- New tires at $1.1k out the door 

\- New MacBook that is $1.2 out the door

Last month I lost $730 as I pay rent a day early for this month as well. 

I've paid all my rent and utilities for this month. My next paycheck on Friday would get me to $2300 in savings this month. 

Here are some other expenses that I still need to make.

\- Iphone 15: The battery on my 11 is on its way out. I was thinking to upgrade on Black Friday to take advantage of the gift card discounts for the Apple Store (more on that below). This is around $780 after taxes. 

\- Apple care for the MacBook. My plan is to get the apple care for my MacBook using the gift card to pay part of it. It is either $70 a year auto renewed or $200 for 3 years. Which one is a better deal? 

\- Microsoft office. I'm unable to transfer my old Microsoft word onto my new one, so I have to get a new one on my Mac. That is $130 at least. I've been relying on google docs for now. 

So here, it is about $1110. 

$2300-1110 =$1,190.00 savings this month.

  
I think I'll be spending another $250 for the rest of this month on food, groceries, gas and a haircut. This is a very conservative estimate. That would leave me with $940 of savings this month. If I combine that with last month then I would only end up saving $200 for October and November combined. 

I technically have about $200 I can get reimbursed from my HSA for expenses but right now the insurance wants to reprocess my claim so I don't want to be reimbursed and have to pay back. 

Should I delay my Microsoft office expenses until next month?

personalfinance,Should I Allocate More into My Company’s Private Stock?,"
Hey Reddit,

I’m a 25M based in Toronto, working in financial services. I make around $140k CAD in a commission-driven role and have managed to save up about $60k.

I’ve maxed out my FHSA and have about $30k of contribution room left in my TFSA, which I should be able to fill by the end of 2025. I currently hold 2,500 out of 5,000 shares vested in my company, which I can purchase for $6.75 per share. The CEO has indicated that there will be future liquidation opportunities, with an estimated selling price of $15 CAD per share. However, I can only purchase these shares while I’m employed at the company.

My current investment strategy has been to dollar-cost average into the S&P 500 through my retirement accounts. With the S&P hitting all-time highs consistently, I’m wondering if I should start allocating more towards my company’s private stock.

While I wouldn’t be able to hold this stock in a tax-advantaged account, it has the potential to significantly outperform the market and represents a limited-time opportunity. If I leave the company, I won’t be able to buy the shares anymore.

Any advice on how to approach this decision would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,I over analyze everything and frequently have buyer’s remorse,"
I don’t know what my deal is, but I tend to over analyze the vast majority of my purchases and now and then get immediate buyer’s remorse. I really don’t know why - I have a great paying job, I’m an avid YNAB user, and I never do any frivolous spending. I rarely spend money on myself. I don’t have credit card debt. But for some reason I over analyze most purchases to the point where it leaves me anxious and don’t go through with the purchase. On top of this, I get instant buyer’s remorse a lot of times.

Recent example - I was thinking it would be fun to upgrade my tv. I can absolutely afford what I was looking at, but I kept feeling guilt of “you don’t need this, the current one is fine” or “you could instead use the money towards a vacation with regroup family” and other things like that. I even went as far as placing the order, instantly became regretful, and immediately canceled the order. I felt the purchase was unnecessary and unwise, even though it was easily affordable. And then I feel like an idiot for feeling the way I do. It’s a fun cycle! 

I know this goes deeper than “I’m trying to be smart with money” and probably something I need to investigate with a therapist. But just once I’d like to be free with spending like this and not get all worked up. Even if it turned out to be a “dumb purchase” in the end, it’s not like it would impact my financial standing or bankrupt me. So why am I like this?",1732070133.0

personalfinance,Buyer's Remorse? Thinking of selling my new car for a cheaper one.,"Hi everyone, 

I'm seeking advice on of it's a sensical decision to sell my current car that I bought new for a cheaper one that I'll have paid off sooner; or if I should just keep grinding away and accept the sunk cost.  

Long story short, I got divorced a year ago and was in need of a car. Maybe hastily, I bought a 2024 Subaru Crosstrek. I'm overall pleased with the car. I don't really want to sell it, but I hate having a car payment more than I thought I would. I'm definitely feeling the strain on my wallet. And, I'd rather use the funds for savings and travel. 

I split the financing between an auto loan at 5.39% and a HELOC at 3.25%. The total original balance was around $32,000.

The current balance on the auto is \~ $11,800 and payments are $300/mo. 

The current balance on the HELOC is \~ $14,200. Minimum payment \~ $140, but I am paying $300. 

The reason I'm paying more on the HELOC is because I'd like to free up the funds to actually use for my home improvements. 

So total debt against the car is \~ $26k. I've paid down around $6k in a year and a half. 

Between the two loans, trying to pay it off early,  I am paying $600/mo for it, which I can swing but I'm definitely feeling the pinch. Auto insurance is about $80/mo. 

For simplicity's sake and not having a back up car in the meantime, I'm assuming I would end up trading at a dealership and best case, break even on the debt against it.  

I do also get a small bonus in the new year where I'd apply at least $1,500 towards the auto loan. 

  


A couple of options going on in my head to get out of this loan:

1.) Trade and get a $10-$15k car---then I have to worry about breaking down/maintenance without a back up car or person. I estimate this would be \~ $10k less of a loan though.

2.) Decrease 410k contributions from 11% down to 5% which is the company match- this would free up \~$200/mo to apply to a loan. I am currently earning 8% on my 401k though. 

3.) Just keep my head down. Eat beans and rice. Apply any extra funds to the auto loan. 

  
Any advice/input welcome! Thank you!!

Currently, I am unemployed and a full-time college student, about a year away from finishing an Associate's degree. I want to complete my classes.

Right now, I feel defeated and filled with dread. I am looking for full and part time jobs in the area but am unsure if I can manage two jobs and being a student. I plan to take a break between finishing my Bachelor’s to focus on paying off this debt.  I currently have only around 3k in my account between my checking and savings.

I would really appreciate any advice. I know I made a stupid mistake, and I understand that I need to take responsibility and work my way out of this. Any help is welcome, thank you!  

For context, the mistake I made was allowing the company to think my secondary insurance was my primary. Unfortunately, they don’t accept my primary insurance, and my secondary insurance won’t pay because they are not liable (which I completely understand). Please don’t make my mistake!

personalfinance,asked to co-sign parents' bridge loan,"edit: confirmation is all i needed. wish i could help, but i don't think this is the move. here's hoping they don't hold this against me.  
  
Hi all, hoping you can all help me out here with a sanity check.

My parents currently own a \~900k home with no mortgage. They worked with a builder to build a $500k home. The plan has been to sell the old home and buy the new home. The new home finished much earlier than expected and the builders are trying to close ASAP. My parents just found out so they're listing their existing home this week.

My parents want to get a bridge loan, here's how it works from my understanding:

This loan company will give my parents a loan for the 500k for the new home. They have also made an offer to purchase the old home for well below market value. My parents will have a few months to try and sell their home for more, but if they can't, they're stuck with the below market sale, but at least the sale is guaranteed.

They are okay with all these terms. I would not be if I were in their position. The closing cost fees and the lowball offer are what I would consider predatory, but the difference between the offer they've received and the value of the new home is more than enough to pay these ridiculous fees. They're aware of it, they're okay with it.

But due to my parent's terrible credit, they need someone to cosign on the bridge loan. It kind of blows my mind that their credit is so bad, that they need a cosigner for a bridge loan where the sale home is worth almost 400k more than the new home. It must be really bad.

I want to help my parents, but I need to understand the risks involved. My original concern was ""what happens if/when they can't sell the house?"" The answer seems to be: my parents get bent over a barrel and sell it for much less than market rate but still walk away with something extra. But at least I wouldn't be on the hook for making any kind of mortgage payment.

What questions should I be asking? My wife and I are close to being able to buy our first home, our timeline is Fall 2025 at the very earliest. What can go wrong that can affect our ability to buy?

Will co-signing on a bridge loan remove my eligibility for first time homebuyer programs?

Would this ding my credit rating, and if so, how long would it take to recover? My current experian score is 815.

Would this count towards my debt : income ratio?

Once the house sale is made, will the closing of the bridge loan ding my credit score?

Again, i see how awful this deal is for my parents. They're okay with it and willing to pay the predatory fees out of their profits. What are the worst case scenarios for me if I do decide to help them?",1732060525.0

I normally paid online every month with no issue. In June of 2022 I received a message on the HMF website “error cannot process payment at this time”. I called Hyundai and they informed me it was an error on the website and I could mail a check.

I mailed a check which was never cashed.

This issue proceeds from June-August of 2022. Online payment can’t be processed, advised to mail a check by Hyundai customer service which is never cashed.

I spoke to a representative on the phone about the possibility of Hyundai incorrectly reporting a late payment, and was assured that notes were made in my file about the issue and any issue would be corrected.

In September of 2022 Hyundai reports my account as 90 days late. I call for an explanation and am told my checks were not cashed because they are from a “non-eligible” bank account. I then am presented with the option to pay over the phone, which I do with my debit card from the same “non eligible” bank account. I then ask for the 90 day remark to be removed because I attempted to pay the debt on time and Hyundai refused to cash my mailed checks, and not take payment online.

I was assured the remark would be removed. I asked for this in writing and was told that Hyundai does not provide communications in writing, only billing statements are provided in writing once a month.

The remark is eventually removed and the technical error is fixed. I finish paying all of my payments on time online for the rest of the lease.

I turn in the lease July 2024. 6 weeks later I receive a letter in the mail from Hyundai stating I owe $977.50 in fees and repairs. I purchased wear and tear coverage from Hyundai. I call Hyundai and inform them the bill I have received is wrong because I have purchased insurance and to send me a corrected bill.

In October I receive a letter stating I owe $0. Today I get a credit alert Hyundai reported me delinquent on October 31 for an owed balance of $0, and updated my previously removed 90 day delinquency as back on my report with another superfluous December late payment added on.

What does everyone advise for a dispute letter to the bureaus? Currently I am experiencing multiple late payment errors with various late dates that don’t match, a delinquency of $0, blank date of last activity, false payment history beyond a 36 month lease (39 months of payment history on a 36 month loan)

personalfinance,"Should I, ironically, actualize gains to offset my current stocks losses for the year?","I currently have a closed out trade I sold earlier this year, which was a long-term hold, that has me at -$7000 approx for the year.

I know that $3,000 of this, max, can be used to offset general income as a loss, with the remains indefinitely carried into next year, and future years if that situation presents itself.

I have some large paper gains on NVDA, all long-term holds, and I was curious if the smartest move is to sell some of this now to cover either $7,000 in gains, presuming that then I would not be taxed capital gains taxes on said NVDA sale, or at least $4,000 in gains, leaving me with $3,000 in loss for the year. With earnings tomorrow, and the year’s end coming up, I thought If it could benefit me in this way to trim the position now, it might make sense.

personalfinance,Please Help - Should I Drop Out of Flight School?,"Background: 22 year old m located in the Midwest. No college degree. I work an entry level job and make approximately 40k a year.

  
My debt:

Vehicle Loan - 12k @ 12%

Credit Card - 11k @ 15%

Student loans - 12k @ 2-5%

  
This was my situation a few months ago. I still have this debt now. Instead of paying off this debt, I enrolled in flight school to become a pilot. I was approved for a loan to cover the entire cost of my training. This is where it gets incredibly sickening the position I am in. 

So far I’ve used 20k of this loan, which is at a whopping 18% interest rate. The rest is able to be used, but not yet used yet. This also isn’t gaining any interest at this time.

So right now, I am over 50,000 dollars in debt with interest rates as high as 18%.

  
Do I drop out of flight school and grind for several years to get zero debt, and then continue my way through and pay with cash? Or, am I too far in, and I should keep going with flight school and use the rest of the 80k of borrowed money at my disposal? If I did this, I’d graduate the program about a year and a half from now at 150k worth of debt.

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans versus Buying a House,"My wife and I have been setting up our emergency fund first as we have had several emergencies that each cost more than 1000 dollars. We've been saving since June and are at $21,000/25,0000. After that we are saving for a house while also paying off our cars. They should be done and paid for by August 2025. Other than that the only debt we will have is student loans, About 40k combined costing 303 per month. All this can be done while we save about $3800 per month for a down payment and closing costs.

My issue is, I don’t want to wait much longer to buy the house. I'll be 26 and she will be 27 if we buy on our projected timeline (June of 2026) without paying off student loans. If we pay loans off first it will take an additional 14-16 months.

My question is, if we can easily afford the monthly payment for our student loans, why not buy our home first and pay them off over 2 years after we move in? We make 185,000 combined and while that should increase over the next two years I haven't factored that into our equation.

I am not currently working (full-time university student) and do not plan to have a job for at least another year, probably 2. I live at home with my parents and have very little need for income outside of some credit card debt I'm getting out of.

I can roll over to an IRA, leave it in the 401K, or withdraw and face penalties (30% total from the account).

personalfinance,Am I crazy for not wanting to use a 401k for retirement?,"I know this is crazy and people might hate on me but I really don't see why you would save money in a 401k for retirement. I understand the tax benefits, but to me it makes much more sense to me to invest your money instead into things will provide you a return, such as businesses or real estate. Some reasons why I think so:

1. **There is no time limit.** This is one of the things that always confused me about retirement planning. You have to assume you'll die and stop needing money at a certain age. What happens if you live past that? With the way things are looking people my age (24) can't count on social security, I doubt it will look the same and may not even be there by the time I'm 80. Also what if I live to be 100? It just doesn't really make sense to me.
2. **You have something to pass on.** If all you do throughout your life is build up a treasure chest that you can live off of when you are ready to stop working where does that leave your kids and/or grandkids? When I pass away I would love to be able to leave a lot for my loved ones, and I hope I don't have to sell it off (As I would a 401k) just to pay for my lifestyle.
3. **You can use the money as you grow old.** For a 401k you are locked into using it at a specific age unless you want to pay penalties for taking it early. Instead of waiting until you are old I think it is better to be able to use your investment's returns as you are getting old. I understand that with compound interest a 401k account would grow also, but it is very hard to use it for specific opportunities such as a business or real estate deal.

I know I'm probably forgetting some, so I'll most likely edit this as time goes on.

Since then, I have moved from an extremely HCOL area to a LCOL area, which also cut my renters and car insurance in half, I haven't added any debt to my credit cards and stick to monthly budgets, I took on a second job and have seen a change in myself but no change in my finances. I used to need a car for work but now that I moved I wfh and could go without a car for a while, however it is not as easy as just selling it as its a lease.

So, the path forward seems to be that I should get a loan for the car, turn around and sell it, and then go without a car and put the car payments towards my CC debt. This is fine and dandy, except I have maxed out my CCs and can't get approved for the car loan. So I plan to cash out my 401K to pay off some CC debt, improve my credit score enough for the car loan, buy and sell the car, and then put the extra money towards rebuilding the 401K and CC debt. The financial breakdown below:

Age: 26

Income: $71,600- take home $3,872

Rent: $1,300

Bills and food: $500

Car Lease: $564

Discover: $12,323/12,600 at 18.99% ($412.00/month)

Chase: $6,431.75/6,500 at 22.49% ($289.75/month)

USAA: $2,436.08/2,500 at 28.65% ($125.00/month)

Personal Loan: $14,279.78 at 17.99% ($499.00/month)

Student Loans: $9,407.86 at 0.00% ($0.00/month - payments resume TBD)

401K: $9,500 available after taxes and penalty

If I were to take from my 401k, what would you apply the 9.5 towards? I would like to pay off the Chase and USAA, freeing up $414/month and improving my credit utilization to get approved for the lease buyout loan. I'm afraid that taking from the 401k is the easy way out, but right now, it seems like the only way out besides drowning for another two years until I can return this lease. I can't make this decision on my own. I don't trust myself enough yet, but I really want what is best, and hopefully, people here can see that without judgment. Thank you",1732048965.0
personalfinance,Seeking Financial Advice for My Mother Facing Homelessness in Kentucky,"I’m reaching out to see if anyone can provide guidance or help me create an action plan for my mother, who is in an extremely difficult financial situation. 

She lives in Kentucky, and she has been with my stepfather (though they were never legally married) for over 14 years. During this time, he handled all financial responsibilities—housing, bills, groceries, etc. Unfortunately, they are now separating on bad terms, leaving my mother without any financial stability or assets to her name, my ""step father"" is saying he owes her nothing and since they were never legally married he doesn't need to take care of her or help her anymore and is completely kicking her out on the curb so to speak. 

Here’s some background:

* She has been on disability and SSI her entire life and currently receives about $800/month in benefits.
* She has no work experience and has never held a job.
* She is 60 years old and has health conditions, including cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, which further complicate her ability to work. 
* She has not yet applied for food stamps or other assistance programs, and I’m unsure of her eligibility or the best way to navigate these systems in the state.
* She has no savings.
* She was looking at trailers to purchase but the high interest rates and cost far exceeds her income. 

I recommended public housing as a potential solution, as this was something we relied on during my childhood when she raised me and my sister with the same income. However, I don’t know how feasible, affordable or accessible that option is now. I also suggested she consider looking for work, but she is very resistant to the idea due to her health and lack of experience.

To be transparent, my relationship with my mother is complicated to say the least, and while I want to help her, I cannot provide financial support or a long-term living arrangement due to our past history. I’ve told her that if she stays with me temporarily, it will be limited to 90 days and I would make her sign documentation and an agreement to be out after 90 days, as I am unable to take on the responsibility of supporting her indefinitely which I know would happen.

I am at a loss for how to help and would greatly appreciate any advice.

personalfinance,ARM Mortgage With No PMI: What’s The Catch?,"Howdy, as the title states, I’m looking for the ‘gotcha’ on an ARM mortgage offered by my credit union (I live in MN; Wings Financial) that has options for 5/1 and 10/1 Adjustable Rate Mortgages. They offer these for as low as 1% or 3% down payment and with no PMI. 

I’m looking to purchase my first home with my spouse and we wouldn’t likely live there for longer than 10 years (for various reasons I won’t get into) but if we did, we would have the option to refinance to a fixed rate mortgage or another ARM etc. 

I know ARMs used to be a lot more risky, but everyone we know continues to warn us not to do an ARM no matter what. Is there something I’m missing? Is everyone else misinformed or out of touch? I would hate to leave a perfect opportunity to finally get into a house on the table.

I racked up a credit card I got at 18 years old. Stupid, I know, and I've been paying $300-$400 a month for a couple years now, the account feels like it has hardly gone down. I don't use my credit cards anymore, but I have two with high interest rates. I also have a car loan with a high interest rate. Accounts are as follows, starting with the largest;

Credit Card 1. $15,700 owed left. 16% Interest, but I used it for Cash Advance a lot which is 20%. Monthly Mimimum is $350, I've been paying $400. (I've already paid over 2k in just interest this year)

Car Loan: $5,700 left. 18% APR. Monthly Payment is $190. I've been paying $200.

Credit Card 2. $900 left. 18% interest rate. I don't see a minimum on it, but I've been paying $100-$150.

As for assets, I have 22k in a retirement account compounding, but I haven't touched it and I don't want to. My dad told me I should use it, but I spoke to a free financial adviser awhile ago who told me not to, he said to pretend it doesn't exist. I'm in college, but I've been going to community college so my classes only cost $100 each + books and a few fees. I've been able to pay out of pocket for these classes.

I have no savings, I've been living paycheck to paycheck with my part time job, about $2,000 a month. I basically pay room rent and bills, and the rest goes to medicine for my dog and food for us.

I don't know the best way to use the money, I am doing better. I don't make impulse purchases anymore, I stopped online shopping, I only go to the shop when I absolutely have to, I buy necessities rather than wants. I even cut up my physical credit cards and froze them online. I feel very hopeful that I might finally be able to get out of this dark tunnel of debt. Talk about an expensive lesson!

Thank you for your help, I really appreciate any input. I don't want to tell my family about the payout and ask for advice, because I feel like the advice will be bad and/or they will want some of the money. Love them, but I don't trust them.

personalfinance,is the tax on pulling money out of brokerage acct and roth ira the same ?,"idk a lot about finance, all i know is stick a decent chunk of money in something stable and never touch it. 

before this year i had tens of thousands of dollars sitting in a regular savings account, out of my adhd boredom i started watching all these finance videos and learned that i had been missing out on basically free money for years. 

I’m not that smart and i can barely make heads or tails out of how complex everything seemed so i gave up on trying to figure out and just started experimenting. 

i put half my money is a HYSA with amex, i left some money in my regular saving account for if i need instant access, i put some money in bitcoin, ethereum and solana, i invested some in a roth ira and invested some in a brokerage account. 

I was thinking of putting more in my brokerage account but i’m wondering if i might as well put it in my roth ira. I am 22 im not big on saving and i think its stupid when people tell 22 year olds to stick half of their money in an ira like tbh i don’t care if im rich when im 70 for lack of better or more mature phrasing i want to buy cool stuff now and enjoy my life as much as responsibly possible. As of now my priority is not to save, I only put my leftover money into savings. I might wake up tomorrow and want to buy a new car or i might not, point being I don’t have any goals as far as purchases i want to make or money i want to save. 

Which brings me to my question. I figure that on the chance that i don’t decide to make any huge purchases then its better to have the money in my roth ira than a brokerage account, but if i do decide to take the money out does it make a difference in whether it was in a roth ira or brokerage account in terms of the tax or fees i would have have to pay on my gains ? Is it that the brokerage account only taxes gains and the ira taxes the full amount withdrawn? or are the both taxed on the gains only

My plan is below, but I'm open to hearing from you all!

Basic details about our situation:

* Gross income is $210,000
* Loan on new home is $664,000. 30 years at 7.1% and monthly mortgage is $4,473. If rates go down in 12-24 months, we'll refinance.
* We have about $100,000 saved for retirement.
* We have two kids in the home with us, ages 16 and 5.

**Baby Step 4 - Save 15% for Retirement**

We currently are saving about 19% of our gross income toward retirement. These are our monthly contributions. The plan below allows us to max out employer matching and Roth, outside of my wife's contributions because she does not receive any employer match. Anything different we should be doing here, perhaps taking my wife's $250 and putting it toward a college fund?

* $834 that I contribute through my employer's plan
* $1,007 contributed by my employer to that same plan
* $250 that my wife contributes
* $1,166 that we contribute to our Roth IRA

**Baby Step 5 - Save for College**

I work in higher education, so it's completely possible that one or both of our children can benefit from tuition remission down the road. Our first daughter did this, and when I left for a different institution, the three of us were able to bankroll her tuition. As we're new to this stage, we are open to recommendations here.

**Baby Step 6 - Pay Off Home**

As mentioned, our monthly mortgage is currently $4,473. We plan to pay an even $5,000. Online calculations show that doing so will allow us to pay the home off 8 years early, even if we never refinance. I do wonder if putting that additional $527/month toward college would be more beneficial. If so, would there be a split that makes more sense to benefit our oldest, as he is 2.5 years from starting college and pour more into our youngest's account when he is done.",1732042654.0

personalfinance,Open enrollment has begun at work. Questions about retirement and HSA specifically.,"My work has open enrollment for 2025 benefits now. I'm staff at a public community college, so we get health insurance, a 457, 401k, an HSA, and a pension. Trying to figure out what's best for me--I'm 27, single, and only intend to stay here another 2 years maximum.

**General info:**

* I make $22.04 an hour pre-tax and work 40 hours per week. We are paid bi-weekly, so 26 paychecks a year. My pre-tax paychecks are $1,763.20. Post-tax I get $1,170.17. Rent is $615 and utilities are $120.
* Federal and state income tax is about $300, union dues are about $37, my health insurance is about $78 (premium + HSA contribution), 457 contribution is about $70, and my pension contribution is about $110. 

**Health insurance:**

* The premium (once per paycheck, paid bi-weekly) for 2024 was $15, and it's $33 for 2025. Not a huge jump, but still. The deductible is now $1,650, co-insurance is $650, and the maximum out of pocket is $2,300.
* My employer contributes $825 to my HSA, which leaves me with $3,475 left to contribute in the year. Divided per paycheck, that's about $133.65 per paycheck. This is a lot. I'm currently contributing $63--this will get me just past the maximum out of pocket by the end of the year. I felt it was the safest minimum amount to contribute.

**Retirement:**

* I have a 457 that I contribute to (always 100% vested) and a 401k that my employer contributes to. The sheet shows a 2% contribution by me for savings, and a 1% match by my employer; then a 2% contribution by me for PHF, and a 2% match by my employer. I don't fully understand the division since the 457 and 401k are not divided into savings and private health fund.
   * I'm currently contributing 4% to my 457 assuming I receive a 3% match from my employer.
* I also contribute 6.2% for my pension with a 6.2% employer match.

**Other:**

* I also have a Roth IRA and HYSA that I contribute to when I can, even if it's just a tiny bit. Usually, I dump as much as I can into the Roth from my savings at the beginning of the year, and then just contribute to my savings as the year goes on.

**Questions:**

* Should I prioritize maximizing my HSA contributions? I've heard this is the best thing to do before contributing to a Roth IRA, but I don't make a ton of money as-is.
* Which retirement elections should I prioritize? I've heard HSA, then 401k/457, then Roth IRA. Just want to make sure that tends to be correct.
* If I leave this job, will my HSA go with me or will I be forced to transfer it to my 457 or forfeit/withdraw it and take the penalty? I suspect this is a question for the bank that holds my HSA, just wondering if there's a standard practice.",1732041836.0
personalfinance,best credit card-type option for a family member who falls for scams?,"Hi. I have an aging family member (approaching 80yo) who seems utterly incapable of not falling for a scam -- constantly giving people her credit card info for faux virus protection, or answering deceptive texts that solicit money. Thankfully most of these have been caught by credit card fraud alerts -- though we've had to repeatedly cancel and get new cards for her.

Short of taking away her phone entirely and isolating her from those remaining loved ones who she does keep in touch with over the phone, I'm looking for ways to limit her downside risk with these scammers. 

My family and I have been considering removing any traditional credit cards from her possession and perhaps giving her prepaid cards to deal with day-to-day expenses. She's still very autonomous and likes it that way... and there's only so much babysitting we can do of her, and we're already spread thin. Though I suppose we also do like the level of protection the cards give her in terms of fraud detection (it's been caught every time). We've frozen her credit so everything is flagged each time, thankfully.

Are there other, better options for credit card type things, knowing that we'd like to try to give her at least some autonomy and independence, but that the constant scamming-cancel-new card cycle is becoming a real issue?

Thank you.",1732041093.0

personalfinance,Question on stock sales and AGI,"Hi all,

I had a relative pass away in September whom I have inherited some stock from in a taxable brokerage account. Per Fidelity, I will only pay taxes on the stocks based on the gains made after the date of her passing in Sept. Most of these stocks are relatively flat and I'm not concerned about the tax gains.

However, I am concerned about my AGI as the financial aid I get for our kids' school is based on that. If I sell a stock worth 25k, even if it has minimal taxable gains, will my AGI go up 25k for the year? I would like to sell these stocks to put into a mutual fund, but losing financial aid would likely force me to take my kids out of their school.",1732040501.0

personalfinance,Lost $7k in My Rollover IRA Due to Vanguard’s Mistake,"I’m trying to do a backdoor Roth IRA, but ran into some issues. I had too much income to contribute directly to a Roth, so I recharacterized it to a traditional IRA. The next step is converting it to Roth, but I need to make sure my Vanguard rollover IRA has a $0 balance by year-end (I have 1,225 shares of VTSAX).

I called Vanguard to confirm the price, and they said it would be yesterday’s price. That was wrong, which I discovered later after checking with others. I tried to cancel the transaction, but couldn’t. I sold the shares at $136, missing out on about $6-7k in potential gains. I’ve learned that you don’t know the final price of selling mutual funds until after the sale.

Vanguard admitted the mistake and said they’ll fix it, but there’s an issue. I already rolled over the funds to Fidelity for 167k, and now the balance is $166k due to market downtrun. Didn't think they'll take responsibility with this. Vanguard will adjust as soon as the money reaches my account (so I'll have 1225 VTSAX again, as if the transaction never happened).

The process:

* Vanguard tried to stop the check on Friday, but it was already cashed by Fidelity. Now my balance is $166k. This steps fails.
* Vanguard will ask Fidelity to return the money. I don’t know how long that’ll take. They said it'll take 3 business days to just prep the letter.
* If above doesn't work, they'll go with reimbursement. I don't know what what this means.

If all of above doesn’t work, Vanguard will make an adjustment for the difference. I asked them to just give me adjustment, but they refused unless I go through all of the process. I asked them to speak with supervisor, but need to wait 48 hours. 

My questions:

* Should I leave the money in Fidelity and proceed with the Roth conversion?
* Should I wait for the process to finish, even if it risks missing the Roth conversion and paying taxes on the $7k roth contribution?

personalfinance,Sell off Stock Portfolio to Avoid Taking Out Student Loans ,I'll start with some background on my situation. I'm currently 25 years old in my first year of law school and I do not currently have a paying job. Going forward most of my tuition is covered by a scholarship and the remaining tuition that I have to pay is set aside. I have enough to cover tuition for my remaining semesters without taking out any loans so that is not an issue. Living expenses is another story. This year I was able to support myself with the money I had previously made at my last job but that will run out around the end of next semester (May). I have about 15000 in a stock account and I'm considering using that money to get me through living expenses for the second year of law school. That plus a stipend that I can likely get for a summer job should be able to cover my 2nd year then I will likely have to take out a loan once I hit third year no matter what. I'm wondering if it would be smart to sell off that portfolio to avoid taking out loans and racking up interest for at least another year. This stock portfolio was just meant to be a short - medium term investment and I still have a 401K that will not be touched under any circumstances.

personalfinance,Advice on what to do with $45K,"Hello, im trying to figure out the best plan for some additional income I've gotten from stock awards at my job. I personally like to sell when my stocks vest immediately and then reinvest in some blended stock such as ETFs, or use the money to work on my house which is a fixer upper. But I currently have:
- an emergency fund built up
- all my debts are paid off except for my mortgage (which is 6.75% with PMI, I just purchased about a year ago but I've been putting an extra $800 a month to attack principal) 
- no kids, no marriage, 26 year old

Since then, I have stable contract work that leaves me with around $4800/month gross (I have to withhold the tax from each paycheck myself, I put ~20-25% of each paycheck in a HYSA for taxes). The pay is not great and I am struggling with my debt payments. My emergency fund was siphoned to pay for some unexpected medical bills. I recently committed to a budget that should keep me above water, but to be honest I have pathetic discipline and constantly find myself falling back into overspending and debt. Over the past 3 months, I have stuck to the budget and hope to continue to do so, but my CC debt is crushing.

I have about $6000 in CC debt at 26% that has been drowning me. I’ve stopped charging anything to this card and frozen it, but the interest has been continuing to raise the balance.

I’m wondering how catastrophic of an idea it is to refund my PERA funds and pay off the CC debt and get the cloud out from over my head. I understand how terrible it is to use my future to finance my present, but the stress over these payments and having that balance continue to grow while I can’t make meaningful dents into it has been very hard to shake. I understand that I will have to pay income tax and an additional 10% tax on an early withdrawal so that $9800 I have would likely be somewhere around $6000 or so. 

At my current point in life, having that money seems like a life rope to get off a sinking ship. Of course I recognize that without commitment to changing my lifestyle and spending habits, i’ll soon be in the same position but without $10,000 for retirement. I just can’t figure out what to do.

The other option would be to pull it out and roll over to an IRA and invest with those funds, but I’m not exactly sure how to do that either without incurring tax penalties.

I’m eating one meal a day to save on groceries.

Rent is $500/month, which is as low as we can reasonably get.

We don’t pay for any streaming subscriptions or other non-essentials.

Goals:

1.	Pay off the $9k in credit card debt as quickly as possible.

2.	Start saving for an emergency fund.

3.	Build a long-term financial plan for stability and growth.

Questions:

1.	What are the best strategies to tackle this level of credit card debt? I’m already looking into balance transfers and potentially a debt consolidation loan.

2.	How can I boost my income quickly, even while starting a new job? I’m willing to hustle and explore side gigs or other options.

3.	What are some practical budgeting tips that have worked for you when money is already cut back to the bone?

4.	Any advice for balancing finances with a young family and a student spouse?

I know this is going to take time and hard work, but I’m ready to do whatever it takes. Thank you in advance for any advice or insights you can share.",1732031505.0

personalfinance,Is it possible to have a conversation on the Roth vs Trad IRA question?,"I am long retired and worked before Roth IRAs were a thing and am a bit surprised by the love of the Roth over the traditional IRA here.    It seems to me to be a math problem.    Higher tax rates while working means use the deduction and lower tax rates in retirement means take advantage of the lower tax burden.   Yes there are RMDs but that is why you are investing for retirement to use that money when you are no longer working.

My career started out like yours I imagine.  Low 20% incremental tax rate, but as I got older I was able to make iit to higher brackets and lived in a state with state income tax, so typically paid an incremental tax rate in the upper 20% and occasionally lower 30%.   So I needed and valued the tax deduction.   Now many years in retirement we are running around the 24% incremental bracket.   There is no way a Roth IRA would have made since in my case.

Do you somehow think you will be paying a higher incremental tax rate in retirement.    If you are an oustanding saver and investor that may be true, but I bet for most it is not.",1732030900.0

personalfinance,"Can someone explain why I shouldn’t refinance, especially when I’m being pressured into a higher interest rate by the loan officer","Years ago, my dad co-signed a loan with my uncle, which helped my dad get a house. Now, my aunt's loan officer is pressuring my dad to refinance the mortgage because they just closed on a property. The issue is that my uncle, who’s still on the loan, has too much debt to close on his own property, so they’re asking my dad to refinance to remove my uncle from the mortgage.

The remaining loan balance on the house is $60K, with only 5 years left to pay it off. The loan officer is offering a 7.8% interest rate, which I think is too high. I found a better rate of 6.4% with another loan officer, but the current one is rushing us to make a decision, saying we need to sign immediately or the deal will fall through.

When I told him I was going with another loan officer, he responded by saying, ""I didn’t even want to do your loan."" He also downplayed the importance of the interest rate, saying it’s a small amount of money and implied I was overthinking.

I’m helping my dad navigate this situation, and that’s why I’m asking for advice. I want to help my family, but I also need to make the best financial decision for everyone involved. Was I wrong to switch loan officers?

personalfinance,Transferring both a roth and traditional 401k into matching IRAs - how do I avoid pro rata rule violations?,"Hey everyone.

I have been offered a new job that I am strongly considering taking.

With my current employer, I have both a traditional 401k as well as a roth 401k.

The new employer will offer a 403b, I'm not sure whether it is a traditional, roth, or both. 

I also maintain a POST TAX traditional IRA I have historically used *only* for serving as an account for performing a backdoor roth. I also, of course, have a roth ira. This is because of the sunsetting provisions and my pay being somewhat bursty, it was easier to contribute the max amount of POST TAX dollars into the traditional on jan 2nd, then once the funds had cleared, convert it all to roth. 

I think my plan is currently as follows:

1. Open a new traditional IRA that is set up for pre-tax dollars.
2. Perform a rollover of my roth 401k into the roth IRA.
3. Perform a rollover of my traditional 401k into the pre-tax traditional IRA.
4. In the new year once the dust has settled and jobs have been changed, I will invest into the roth IRA directly since I won't be earning enough to worry about sunset anymore.

I am specifically looking to avoid transferring my 401ks into the 403b as most educational services locally use extremely high cost 403b providers (equitable) and I don't really want to be paying 1-2% on my investments when I could be paying a much lower rate at vanguard where my IRAs are located.

The new position will not be earning as much as the old one, and so I believe I can avoid doing the backdoor roth IRA into the future.

Does this all make sense? I know rolling the 401k into the ira can trigger pro rata issues so I just want to get some eyes on this to make sure it all makes sense.",1732028530.0

We had state farm for years, but it was abruptly canceled when they learned it was a work-live (even though we had 10+ instances of documentation stating it was a work live including day one paperwork, but I digress), and now have a local bigger insurance who was fine the first year (zero claims), but then raised premiums by a thousand dollars which is a lot for a small business.

Or do I help my partner with their debt?","Hi there, I'm not used to posting on Reddit so forgive me if I worded any of this poorly Z\_Z.

  
So I'm (31) a small business owner in the creative/artistic/performance industry (technically a sole proprietor w/o an LLC if it matters), and things have gone really well for me. I'm saving thousands of dollars almost every month, mostly in hopes of buying a house one day. Up until last year, I've been pretty poor, so this is a new development for me, and one I have no idea what to do with (a good problem to have, though, admittedly). 

I figured at this rate I was going to be able afford a house sooner than later, so I've just kept it uh, is liquid the right term? in savings accounts with 3.5-5% APY, but now that I've saved up over 60k that way (and my partner is no longer in a financial position to help fund a house--most of which are fairly expensive here in the Denver market), I just feel like I should be doing something \*more\* with it while we wait/I save as it could be anywhere from 1 to 5 years. I also don't need to save up a down payment that large even if I wanted to keep a large sum of money handy. 

Seeing as I'm a freelancer and have always been a freelancer with no 401K, SS, etc, I've been advised to put the maximum allotment into a Roth IRA, but that's kind of about all the advice I've gotten. I've also been considering helping my partner out with their debt since that'll ultimately be a consideration that affects our loan options (and them paying 20%+ on interest is definitively worse than me earning an extra 5-10% through investments, or so I assume). Of course if I did do that, rest assured there would be a contract of some form of fashion. (I love them to pieces, but I'm careful with my money because I remember what it's like to work a lot harder for a lot less). And I have no debt to pay down personally. Other than that I already have about 35k in other savings/investments from previous years, not including the 60k+ figure above. (As a freelancer, I really just try to 'over-save' as much as possible haha. No health insurance, no retirement accounts, etc. Just seems really important to do I guess.)

What do you all recommend for me to best setup my financial future and/or house buying prospects? Preferably something that's really simple/easy to manage and/or access. I'm the type of person who hates having more than one credit card, bank account, and prefers to use apps for ease and accessibility of use (for instance, I have an Acorns account, and considered looking into Roots, at one point I invested into Crypto--good and bad that haha), but I'm definitely willing to hear out more complicated options if they're significantly better. I'll likely help my partner with some if not all of their non-student loan debt (16k on CC, 12k on a car), but I could technically wipe all of that and still have money leftover. (Which feels like a really crazy thing to say??? I literally cannot overstate how much I've never been in this position before.) So where else should it go?

personalfinance,Evaluating whether I should enter an employment program or not,"Just last year I went from being legally blind and having 95% of my visual acuity in my remaining eye to losing most of my central vision. I'm in my mid 20s and several years back I moved from Virginia to the Deep South after graduating college. Truthfully I've never found my footing career-wise. It's been floated to me that I should join the Blind Enterprise Program, which offers disabled people in my situation the opportunity to (effectively) operate food service and micro-retail businesses, think vending machines in government offices and state prisons. While I may prefer to become a teacher, the licensing procedure in my state takes four years on top of a Bachelor's degree, while this program takes about 20 weeks. Thinking long-term, I'd definitely not mind becoming a teacher.. but the time to get a licnese feels like a hindrance.  I have 3 years of experience in purchasing and am finding it difficult to get hired on by a company, so I see this as something to do for the next 4-5 years that can help me live on my own.

While I am going off of limited data, gross income for sites I have seen ranges from 60-90k/annum, net proceeds are about 1/2 to 1/3rd. Top-line national figures suggest the average is around 50k/yr. In a purely mathematical sense, it seems like a good idea.

 There are a few issues I can see arising:

1) Getting over the stigma of this not being a ""side hustle"" but, you know, basically a full time job. It's low-skilled gig work with a lot of government bureaucracy involved. I'm paraphrasing from some book, but ""it's hard to see a potential path out if you're stuck in a room without much opportunity"".

2) While startup costs are minimal, most locations I've heard of are located outside of my county and in general far from civilization (think a prison commissary). Logistically, I don't know how you service those without spending 4 hours in a car simply driving to the location 2 days each week. That's not feasible for most people even hired drivers.

3) Looming issues around tariffs. i previously worked in hospitality purchasing through COVID, I remember the whiplash of supply chain issues and it almost gave me a stomach ulcer. Rising costs way beyond projections and literally no way not to spend the money, the margins and top-line figures seem a bit too optimistic.",1732011282.0
personalfinance,Question about Charge Off and Settlement,"Hello!

Background:  I was self-employed and had a personal loan and credit card through Navy Federal that I defaulted on back in 2021 .. COVID didn't help either. So anyway, I went to apply for a mortgage recently and this negative mark on my credit is hurting me.  I have a few missed credit card payments from a few years ago, but other than those I have been steadily rebuilding my credit and it is rising (around 570 now). Navy Federal has this listed as a ""Charge Off"" on my report, and it just hit my credit report in Sept 2024.

 I contacted Navy Federal to get information about this and they said they are having a third party collect the debt (Apelles, LLC which is a collections agency). I contacted Apelles and they said I can either pay the total debt in full (around $26k) or they will settle with me and I will have to pay $8900 (I looked back through emails from Navy Fed and this is the settlement amount they gave me also, but I was stupid and ignored it). They said they are handling the payment, and once I pay it then they will give to NFCU and then the debt on my credit report will be updated to ""Settled"" and it will no longer be listed as a ""Charge Off"". Apelles also said they will provide me with a letter stating the debt has been settled and they are no longer seeking payment, which I can give to my lender.

My Dilemma: My mortgage lender stated that since Navy Federal has this debt listed as a ""Charge Off"", means they are no longer attempting to collect the debt and they essentially wrote it off and I should receive a 1099 (to essentially report it as income, but I haven't received one). He suggested that I write a letter to NFCU and Apelles to dispute the debt and state that they are reporting this debt incorrectly and that I do not owe it (since it was charged off) according to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. However, when I spoke to Navy Federal, they said they have not charged it off and they are still seeking payment but using a third party to collect payment.

I am confused by all of this, and honestly I want to correct this on my report so that I can move on, build my score again, and get a mortgage. I am able to pay the settlement for $8900. This is the only thing that is weighing me down. I am much more responsible with my spending and I pay my cards in full every month.

What do I do? Any advice is much appreciated! Thank you!",1732010754.0

personalfinance,Do I sell my condo or rent the extra bedroom? ,"Hi All,

Struggling with a decision I need to make in the next 24 hours (saying yes/no to a potential roommate).

I bought a condo back in 2022 (I've owned for exactly 2 years) in Southern California. Put 20% down, have a high mortgage payment due to interest rates at the time (and still have not fallen).

My industry also went on strike and I lost a LOT of work I thought I was going to have, and it all sort of ran dry. I can cover about half my expenses now with my limited income, and have about a year and a half of savings left.

It's been so hard to find a decent job and I'm going crazy seeing my savings drain. My condo is a 2-BR and I'm considering renting out the extra room which would cover about 1/3 of my mortgage payment. Definitely helps.

But, I don't want a roommate. This would be an easier situation if I was renting and could just move/downgrade, but I own like a big boy now. I was browsing ads for rentals and seeing prices for about 1/2 to 2/3rds my mortgage price in a great area and am drooling a bit. But if I were to sell ALREADY, would all the costs make this whole buying decision I made not worth it? Do I bite the bullet and get a roommate?

If I sold, I'd have access to a good amount of equity that I could rent with and invest in other areas while I continue looking for work. But then I miss the boat on owning. I'm a single male, and this isn't my dream home, it was meant to function more as an investment.

Do I drive myself crazy with a roommate just to keep my condo, or drive myself crazy seeing my savings drain a lot faster? That's where I feel stuck -- what's the price for the peace of mind of living alone?

What would you do? Thanks for reading!

EDIT: Some financial info:

Current mortgage: $4,000/mo.

Roommate portion would be: $1,500/mo.

Rent for a 2-br place I'd live in: $2,600/mo. (so the price would be about even for me, except no roommate and no owning).

I have about $80,000 in savings, and $225K-$250K in equity. Obviously subtract closing costs but most of that I'd be able to invest.

On top of that I have $28K in federal loans which I've stopped working on since the strike/lack of work...",1732005713.0

Right now she wants to start building her credit to get a small car loan in the future.

Would it be smart for her to also apply for other credit sources? Perhaps a really small personal loan she can easily pay off in a short period of time? Or would that have a negative effect on her credit score?

personalfinance,Financially clueless - credit card debt,"I will start by saying I no longer use credit cards. 

I’m looking for advice on how to consolidate and pay off my credit card debt ASAP. I have multiple cards with different companies (chase, capital one, discover, US bank) with varying amounts on them, totaling close to 30 K. I’ve stopped using credit cards and am paying off the minimum m balances, but now that I am only using my debit card, I have over-drafted a few times because ally my bills and student loans come out at once. I want to consolidate my credit cards into one place, but I have no idea where to start doing this. I’m so afraid of getting scammed or tanking my credit, but I also cannot afford to be almost over drafting every month. 

I have a budget I’m sticking to, and have stopped using my cards. But beyond that I have NO IDEA where to start in terms of consolidating. I am a teacher and make close to 100K a year, and heard I could take a loan out on my retirement, and I also have a very small 401k from before I became a teacher and got a pension. I ignore it because I don’t understand how 401ks work. I also hear of people getting loans through credit unions but I don’t really know what any of this means if I’m being honest. So here are my questions:

 1) after sticking to a budget, where does one start?
2) I am obviously an idiot when it comes to personal finance. Are there people whose jobs it is to help low to middle class people figure out their finances?? OR, related - how do I learn more about this stuff (including smartly investing)? I feel like every Google search brings me to disreputable places and it’s hard to figure out what’s legit 
3) if anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you get out?

personalfinance,Just Got Married - Need Some Advice,"People of reddit--my wife and I just got married!

We're going through the process of combining our finances and wanted to reach out to seek some guidance.

We need the following:

* Checking account to receive paychecks, pay credit cards, and hold no more than $5k in...our biggest need is for access to international ATMs at low / no fees as we travel a lot
   * Currently holding 2 credit cards - AmEx Plat & Chase Sapphire Reserve, will likely consolidate as it feels like a lot to have both at the same time
* Investment account for the vast majority of our money - brokerage, retirement, and money market accounts --> managed quarterly / monthly at most

Any reccomendations for easy personal finance stacks we could build on?

Current thought is to open checking account with Schwab because of free international ATMs and no minimum funding requirement and managing our investments in Vanguard.

personalfinance,"Best, low risk, place to park life insurance payout.","We put a life insurance payout into a 6 month CD (6 months ago) since we didn't have the headspace to make a plan for it. 

Now that its matured an edward jones employee contacted us and said we should put it back in a 6 month CD at 4.2%, or into a money market account (no FDIC insurance.)

Nearly 100% of my savings have been put into index funds or stocks so keeping this money lower risk seems smart. We will max out Roth IRA contributions this year regardless.

We do not need liquidity, but it seems like locking it away in a CD, or putting it slightly more at risk in a money market account are both worse options than a high yield savings account. We also just took out a HELOC loan at 7.2%, going up to 8.5% that is about 1/6th of the life insurance payout. I am hoping to pay that back aggressively out of income, hoping to have a job starting in January, but thats a bunch of hoping. 

Is the CD smart because rates are about to drop a lot?

Is there someplace that gives a bonus payout or startup payout for moving 6 figures in?

Is paying off the HELOC the smartest move since 8ish% is higher than 4ish%?

Are there smart questions im not asking? 

I have read the general guide, but think this is worth asking since we largely have the basics covered and im thinking more about maximizing low risk interest rate options.

I currently make $3400 monthly that will be cut to $3000 in January.

My concern is that my dog needs surgery and I will be paying between $6000-$8000, so I will likely need to take a loan to pay for it. The surgery is completely non negotiatable for me.

My options are:

1) Use my entire savings to pay for as much of the surgery as possible.

2) Pay off my car and use the remainder of my savings to pay as much of the surgery as possible and take a loan for the rest.

3) Don't pay off the car, pay half the surgery, and take a loan for the remainder.

I'm leaning very heavily to number 3. I'm very hesitant to drain my savings, especially since I will be needing to move out in February and need the money as a security deposit. Absolute worst case scenario is that I need to stay where I am. I am only moving because I hate my neighbors (shouting as I typing this). Not to mention that I will not be able to build my savings again very quickly leaving me feeling vulnerable.

I can possibly slash my expenses down to the absolute bare minimum along with doing 10-20hrs overtime weekly, however I will likely also be draining my mental health severely by doing so and now is not a good time with other things going on in my life, not least of which my injured dog.

Any advice or insight is appreciated. I'm likely going to just have to tough out the overtime but I still want to consider any options.

personalfinance,I’ve Screwed Myself Over,"Long story short, this year has been horrendous. My dad died, my grandma died, my cat died, my SIL has cancer, my income dropped, one roommate moved for work and just stopped paying, and another I had to kick out because it was not good, and I was being taken advantage of (trying to help a friend who needed a place). I have fallen so behind on my bills, and I’m just not sure what else to do. I have a decent income (~$100k) but I’m so late on my payments that it seems impossible to catch up. I’m current on my mortgage, HOA, and utilities. I’m behind on all debt payments (which total $64k—about $3k behind). I had already worked out hardship plans but still can’t afford those. I have two side hustles but have been so depressed that I haven’t been able to motivate myself to work on them… I’ve already ruined my credit… it was 843 and now it’s 476. Should I try to catch up or declare bankruptcy? Do I have any other options? 

Edited with numbers:
Monthly take home pay, after 22% is taken out for my pension, which is the minimum I can have taken out: $5,406, but I’ve lost about $1,500 a month for 5/7 of the last months
Mortgage/Home Ins./Property Tax: $2,806 (rent is about $300-400 a month cheaper where I live if I were to sell and stay in same area, one of the cheapest where I live)
HOA: $109
Power: $102
Water: $60
Internet: $80
Cell Phone: $53
Car Ins. $145
Gas: $90
Monthly Subscriptions: $18
Groceries/Housewares: $350
Eating Out: $350
Pets: $100
Misc: $100 (hair cut, makeup, feminine products, clothes, etc)
Roth: $400 (on pause currently) 

It doesn’t look scary until you factor in that I have missed pay significantly more than usual this year due to everything going on in my life, so you can see how I got behind on credit cards. 

Here are my debts:
Credit Cards: $52,000, minimums: $1,300, interest: 6-10% (I’ve negotiated this twice)
Personal Loan: $9,000, minimum: $330, interest: 8%

I’m 3 months behind in a week, so about $5,000. More than I thought 😩

As far as family goes, I don’t have any help or support. My dad had a will, according to what he told me the night before he passed, but when I ask my step mom about it she won’t answer me and literally changes the subject (I finally asked if he left me literally anything—even just a tshirt or a massage gun, and she still avoids answering). It’s on my list to call a probate attorney, but I literally have no clue what the deal is. It’s hard to imagine he didn’t leave me anything; he and I were super close, and he was a surgeon, but my step mom is… interesting? She and her sister are still fighting over their mom’s will, and her mom passed 5 years ago. I don’t really know anything beyond that. The lawyers I’ve talked to all said I can write a note to include in my file if I declare bankruptcy. 

I am usually really good with money and super motivated. I worked 3 jobs for 12 years to pay off student loans and then saved another $85k to buy a house on a conventional loan in a high cost of living state to be close to my family. Prior to this happening, I had never had an overdraft on my bank account and never paid a bill late. I know how to get out of debt, but I guess I just don’t know what else to do to get caught back up. I’m burnt out and depressed (don’t worry too much—I have multiple degrees in this area and know what I need to do). I’ll get there, but I’m thick in the grief process right now, and this isn’t helping. I had a 3 month emergency fund, but I ended up going through that when I was roommateless. I would prefer NOT to rent out my spare bedroom. I have had the worst experiences this year.

I have talked to my financial planners, and they recommend bankruptcy if I can qualify for a chapter 7. I would keep my house and car according to laws in my state. I don’t anticipate needing credit for anything in the near future as I already have a house and reliable vehicle; honestly, at this point, I think my credit would be fixed faster if I did either form of bankruptcy. At least bankruptcy would restructure everything and get me caught up. I obviously am torn about doing this since I keep delaying it and trying to figure out another way—including here. I feel like such a failure.

ANOTHER EDIT: I COULD pull $5k from my Roth IRA to catch up and take the tax hit (I got a big refund last year). Ugh. IDK!

personalfinance,Child tax credit versus living expenses for additional person in household,"Edit #2- question resolved. Thx so much u/Its-a-write-off!!!



Question/opinions comparing which is more beneficial for us and current family situation. My husband’s adult son (currently in college) moved in with us full time this past January 2024. He use to be split 50/50 with his mother. My husband and his mom would alternate the child tax credit each year as well. Last year was my husband’s turn to claim for 2023 tax year, however the mother was upset due to reportedly having several expenses that were not split and wanted to claim the tax credit. Husband wanted an itemized invoice in order to split those costs instead of giving up claiming the child on his taxes that year.

Fast forward to present day. Since the kid lives with us full time, I am not sure if fair to continue alternating child tax credits. I could be incorrect so feel free to point that out (nicely). The kid is on the mom/step-dad’s insurance though he also has healthcare through Native American Tribe. They also pay for his cell phone service. We cover his car insurance, gas money, and the regular increase in utilities/food when adding another person to a household.

How would I go about comparing the increase in our costs versus what we would gain or lose with the child tax credit? Thx for any info!

EDIT: My apologies for my major confusion! Step-son too old for child tax credit and both sets of parents (mom & step-dad OR dad & step-mom) aren't single so Head of Household doesn't seem to apply.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this on, but my situation is as follows:

On Sept 28 I paid for something.  On October 14, I closed the account/debit card that I used to make that purchase.  On October 21, I was issued a surprise refund for my original payment, and the refund went to the now-closed card I paid with originally.

I have been on this month long back and forth between the merchant and my bank, trying to get the refunded money sent to an active account.  The problem is, the merchant no longer has the funds they sent out for my refund, and the bank has no record of those funds arriving.  In other words, the merchant doesn't have the money and neither does the bank--the funds didn't even bounce once they reached the closed debit card.  Every time I contact the merchant, they tell me to contact the bank to return the funds.  Every time I contact the bank, they tell me to contact the merchant because they can't even file a dispute on funds that don't exist.

personalfinance,Advice on tricky situation,"I hope this makes sense because it’s a convoluted situation. 

A retired F recently got divorced and had her son buy her ex out of 43% of their home. The son got a mortgage at almost 50% of his income, is living in the home and she’s currently renting a unit from another son but is only paying 1/2 of the rent because she only makes 2k in SS a month. So the other son has to cover the rest. 

The first son wants his mom to do a buy back and sell him and his GF the rest of the house for a monthly payment for the next 15-20 years. They can’t afford to get a loan for the remainder of the house. So if she doesn’t agree they need to sell the house. 

A few of us think this situation is a terrible idea but it’s such an emotional situation that no one is listening to reason and the first son obviously is trying to do whatever he can to keep the house which is way more than they can afford. 

My questions are the following:

- would this make sense at all to keep the house?
- what problems do you see with such an arrangement? 
- what is the best way out of this?

I feel like I know what everyone is going to say but as I’m not a pro in real estate or finance I need more information to show them the pitfalls of this arrangement.

I recently took a position at a new job. They offer a 5% discount on employee stock purchase plan, with buys twice a year, no look back, and no holding period.

In comparison, my former employer offered a 15% discount with four buys per year. No look back and no holding period. 

Both capped at 25% of income.

It now has over 200k miles on it and just recently started costing significantly more to fix mechanical problems with the car. It cost us about $1500 last year. We already put $2700 earlier this year for 2 repairs, 1 for an axle seal and the other for Front and Rear Struts. Now, we are facing another $2500 in repairs for Engine and Transmission mounts, Rear Lower Control Arms, Transmission Fluid, and Brake Fluid. And our feeling is that these repairs are going to continue to mount. 

She wants to purchase a lower mileage 2008 Ford Taurus X that we found about 2 hours from us that I found online. However, the cost seems really high to me. The price was $9999, but the total tax, tag, and title the Sales Guy gave me was $11,789. 

We have a decent amount of cash on hand, thankfully, so we could buy a new or a used car, but my wife doesn't really like anything that isn't $60k+. I know it seems silly, but she loves the Ford Taurus X because it's familiar, and the only other vehicles she has driven that she likes are either the GMC Yukon or the Jeep Wagoneer.

To minimize interest, I pay my credit card balance in full several times a month and rarely let a balance revolve.

However, I’ve noticed that this practice causes my credit score to fluctuate, as the credit bureaus observe my credit card debt increasing and then decreasing frequently.

I’m hesitant to use my debit card for online shopping because of the higher risk and fewer protections if it were to be compromised. I’ve also considered prepaid VISA cards, but their fees seem excessive.

personalfinance,Never thought about the future before,"Hello all, just looking for some opinions/constructive criticism as I try to financially plan for the future.



For background, I am getting serious with my girlfriend and she has expressed that I should start taking my (soon to be our) personal finances more seriously. We were having a relationship logistics talk and when we get on the topic of finances she is typically not satisfied with how I manage them (I don't). I've basically lived on pure impulse and things mostly pan out. I don't educate myself much outside my work and personal interests and don't know where to begin to put a plan together. Listed below are some of the problem areas we have identified together.

1. Budget - Don't have one, don't need one. I know how much I have coming in every month and I just spend less than that. This has been my strategy since I turned 18 and I have never rethought it (Im 31). The surplus gets saved to a savings account. I have 3 months of all my expenses saved.

2. Investing - All dollars above the 3 months expenses get split in two. My good friend built a ""trade bot"" that tells him how to buy stocks. Not sure how it works, I'm not that kind of engineer, He built the bot and I fronted the money for him to test it. So far its done well? There is more in there than the sum of all my deposits so I assume thats good. She asked me how its doing against the market? She thinks the trade bot and the fact shes never met this friend are sketchy and wants me to put it in a ""normal"" investment account. The other half I use to buy project cars. As I hobby I purchase and restore old cars. I can perform a full frame off restoration including electrical, paint, uphostlery and engine work in my shop.  I keep the ones I like and sell the ones I dont have space for. I love it and if we are being honest it was unironically my only investment ""plan"" when I was single. Old Mercs and Bimmers turn a good profit if you are not paying for the labor.

3. House - I bought a house in Massachusetts some time ago and have been renting out for about 7 years now. Really not sure what to do next. Its managed by a property manager and I have not seen it since I left 7 years ago. I don't know what to do with it and she thinks I should know what to do with it?



I am not lazy and I do have the desire to figure out how to be financially literate. I just dont know where to start. It just has never been something I have thought about and I am woefully behind the power curve of understanding and have not lived the lifestyle. I still fundamentally do not believe I need a budget.

To be quick and to the point as I am on my way out -

I worked for an LLC for several years as an independent contractor (1099). I found out the final year that I have been misclassified as a 1099 the entirety of working there. I got testy with my ""job requirements"" and was fired. I have yet to receive a final owed paycheck. So far I have really only lightly researched potentially charging interest owed for the paycheck, as well as pursuing legal action towards the company to recoup funds for prior taxes. I also have began reaching out to Attorney's in my area.

This feels like such a daunting issue with a lot of unknowns on my part. I want to receive the most compensation I possibly can - as I owed thousands each year for taxes (didn't learn how to do my taxes efficiently until the final year either 🙄😅), and I just feel generally pissed off about being treated like a W2 without the benefits.

Just a small side comment - I was the youngest contractor working for the company, working with people twice my age who also likely do not know they were/are being misclassified.... better learning all of this late, but not double my age late, is definitely a positive from my perspective.

I retired 2 years ago at 70 and sold my small business for 7 figures.  I hold a 4% note and am collecting 10% of gross revenue (around 100k per year), the bulk of which is categorized as LTCG.  

For reasons I won't go into, my IRA with Schwab was not funded over past 2 decades the way it should have been, so I am currently sitting on 'only' about $450K in that account.  I was too busy running the business and spending earnings to think about retirement and investment strategies (belatedly remedied by reading r/bogleheads etc.)  

About 8 years ago I took some investing 'play money' and bought quite a bit of TSLA.  That stock is in an after-tax investment account and is worth, as of today, right at $680,000. 

My quandary is this:  How do I unwind from that single stock so I can move the money into bonds and index funds to pad my retirement income?  Clearly, holding such a large percentage of my net worth  ($2.8M) in a single stock is extremely risky.  Obviously, I could just bite the bullet and sell the bulk of the stock, either all at once or over months/years, but would pay 20% capital gains on the sale.  And that would also put me in a high tax bracket as well as affect things like social security IRMMA.

Primary we owe about $500k, value is \~ $2.1- 2.3 million, vacation we owe $330k, value is \~$615-625k.

Trying to decide if we sell the secondary home or rent out, the second house is in a tourist area, and we have only ever used it as a vacation spot, but lately it's been to hard to get up to it. We could long term rent for or try the airbnb route and rent for more. 

I am overly invested in my company stock as I never really sold my RSUs/ESPP and they have a value of \~$1.85 million. I have a diversified 401k that is valued at \~$1.3 million that I need to move into a rollover IRA and will need to make some investment choices once it is rolled over. Also have 6-8 months expenses in HYSA. I also need to move most of my severance into something that makes a little money. 

Lost and don't know how to make sure what I do have will last us if I don't find something. 

My question is really, would I be stupid to sell 1/3 of my company stock and pay off my primary house if I can't find a new job in the next year? I know I could sell some to cover expenses over the next few years, along with our cash reserves, but something about being completely debt free puts my mind at ease.

personalfinance,Pay extra on Mortgage or HELOC?,"Hello,

We currently have a 20 year mortgage, with 17 years left to pay. Interest rate is 2.875%; balance is $158,000; payment is $1,000. (This does not include our taxes/insurance)

We have a HELOC with a $46,000 balance at 7.75%. We have interest only payments right now of about $300. 

We wanted to roll the HELOC into a new mortgage and refinance down to a 12 year mortgage to cut five years off our loan. Total payment would be about $2000 with a rate of 6.25%. However, I’m wondering if we should just pay extra on one of the loans because our current mortgage rate is so low. If we go this route, is it better to pay extra on the HELOC? Or our Mortgage? 

I’m hoping rates will come down next year, like everyone else of course. Maybe combine the two loans when/if rates ever get down to 4.5-5%.

Thoughts? 

ETA: I know, I sound dumb wanting to refi to a higher rate but liked the idea of combining the two to get them paid off in 12 years.  I thought with my HELOC being higher rate, maybe it would be a wash to combine them. But now that I say this all out loud, I realize how bad of an idea that would be. ",1731961562.0
personalfinance,Not very good with money - please opine on my plan...,"Hi All!  Thanks for taking the time to read.  I am interested in knowing the thoughts others who know more about money and depreciating assets.

I am recently retired and live alone in a 2020 year model RV.  I support myself with a pension I earned from the state, over the course of 35 years.  It is a modest pension; enough to barely cover my monthly expenses.

I chose this lifestyle (full-time RV living), because it best suits my needs at the present, and I need to have the ability to move locations on short notice.

The RV I am in now, I bought in 2021.  It's present worth is about $29,000 retail, and I have paid the loan down to $28,500.  APR is 7.19%.  I needed low monthly payments when I first financed, and am afraid that I am going to be upside down soon on this loan.  This RV also no longer fits my lifestyle and needs.  

My situation has changed and I have enough money to make some sweeping changes.   I want to purchase a ""new-to-me"" RV, which I will live in probably for another 4 or five years, after which time, I see myself settling down stationary.  

RVs I am looking at moving into run in the low to mid 40s ($41K to $46K).  Because I cannot sell my present RV without having a place to live, my thought is to pay off the loan on my current RV, thus avoiding the high monthly interest, purchase my new RV for cash, outright, move from the old RV into the new one, and then fix up and sell the old one.  While I will no longer be paying interest, the old RV will continue to depreciate in value while I own it, and there will be insurance and storage costs associated, until it sells.

Another concern is having $75K in cash tied up in two RVs.

So... opinions whether this is the best path for my situation, or should I buy the newer RV outright, and maintain payments on the loan on the old RV, until it sells and the loan can be satisfied.

personalfinance,Husband and I are $70k in debt (mostly credit cards) - how to get out of this mess? ,"Firstly, please be kind, I already have a lot on my plate, I dont want internet to make me feel even more crappy. Secondly, I am trying to gauge if I have exhausted all my options to fix this financial mess we are in.

I'd like to think I have a good understanding of budgeting/planning for finances etc. Regardless of the backstory of 70k debt, I am looking for ways to get out of this. I haven't been able to financially contribute too much in the last three years given I was pregnant and then on mat leave in Canada, which pays 55% of your salary. I also took that time to get my MBA, which further put us into debt.

Im done with th3 MBA and I now have a good job that pays well, my husband and I make roughly 18k month after taxes.

70k is mostly high interest creditcards. Other than debt relief, is there anything I can do to pay these down. LOC isn't an option since our credit isn't that great given our high debt, I am little lost.

  
Edit: I realized that I have given a very incomplete picture of my situation but what I was really looking for are the tips/tricks to pay this down quickly. Here is the context: we have dual citizenship, we had kids in Canada, so I could take advantage of one year long maternity leave for each of my kid, which I did. So, I was on 55% Canadian income for 2 years, we did put our expenses on the cards, which clearly has racked up now. I am now working in the US, and this money is earned in the US, our gross pay is actually $28k per month but our expenses are quite HIGH. 

Mortgage: $3900, Child care: $5500, Bills: $1200, Cars: $1800, Side business: $1500 all stated in USD, after all this, we are left with $4k per month, all of which will go to the creditcards but what I was really looking for was ways I can expediate the pay-off. 

  
And yes, the side hustle is costing money rightnow, hopefully it pays off.

personalfinance,Pulling SCRS PEBA Account Money for House Down Payment,"Hi all!

So I was a teacher a few years back and accured around $12k in the South Carolina Retirement System through PEBA. I know the general wisdom is to always rollover those savings into a 401k or IRA, but in this case, it could mean the difference between buying a home vs renting a year or two sooner and potentially being able to make a move when the market is more optimal. As I figure with the hefty tax penalties, I'd probably leave with $7.5k to $8k. This would allow us to put a down payment down while also still keeping our buffer savings (we have nearly 3 months of income each). We both make around $51k yearly and each have a car payment for the next 4 years of around $400 each. Currently paying $1400 in rent, but seeing that mortgages could be similar and would rather be paying to own a house so that money is going back to us instead of a landlord.

personalfinance,Saving for college or a future home and retirement?,"My kids are growing up fast and we have been investing on their behalf. I am looking down the road and it's clear that it is much easier to get a loan for college than a mortgage. Loans for college are also generally low interest. There shouldn't be a need to pay them off right away, and they can be deferred if the student is in a graduate program. That said, many families seek to pay tuition upfront or pay off the loans asap. 

I imagine my kids going to a 4 year college and following up with graduate school. This means that they wouldn't be in the job market until they are nearly 30 and they wouldn't need to start making payments on their loans until then. In the meantime, I can continue to invest on their behalf, growing their $15k accounts to $150k by that time. 

They will emerge on the job market with $150k that will help buffer their transition to work-life. They can buy a house - at least here in the Midwest - and start building equity asap. Sure, they will still have loan payments, and mortgage payments, but they will also have a nest egg that is growing at 8% interest that will compete against their 3% student loan. It will also allow me to keep principal in the market instead of the school's bank account. 

I'll have more money to help my kids out in their 30's and beyond. In the end, it seems like we should hold our money in the market as long as possible and let our kids pursue whatever education they want, preferably deferring payment while in graduate school so they can maximize their earnings in their professional life.

personalfinance,I Made a Series of Financial Mistakes and Lost Everything—Looking for Advice to Start Over,"

Hi, everyone.
I never thought I'd be in a position where I’d be asking strangers for advice, but here I am. Over the past two years, my life has completely unraveled, and I’m struggling to figure out how to pick up the pieces.

It all started during the pandemic. I was doing okay financially, working a steady job and saving little by little. But when the stock market dipped, I thought I saw an opportunity to grow my savings quickly. I went all in—everything I had—on a few individual stocks, ignoring the warnings about diversification. At first, things looked promising, but as the market shifted, I realized too late that I didn’t know what I was doing. I lost nearly my entire savings, around $25,000, which was everything I had worked for.

To make matters worse, my marriage began falling apart during this time. The financial stress, combined with other personal issues, became too much. My wife left and took our 5-year-old daughter with her. I don’t blame her—I wasn’t the person she married anymore.

Now, I’m living paycheck to paycheck, trying to make ends meet. I rent a tiny studio apartment, and my credit card debt is piling up because I can’t keep up with basic expenses. I’m drowning and feel like I’ve let everyone, including myself, down.

I know I made mistakes, and I’m not looking for pity. What I really need is advice. How do I start over when I’ve hit rock bottom?

Here’s where I stand:

    Income: $2,800/month after taxes
    Rent: $1,200/month
    Credit Card Debt: $9,000 at 22% APR
    No savings, no investments, no retirement accounts
    Skills: Basic office work, but no degree

I’m open to any suggestions—whether it’s budgeting, side gigs, negotiating debt, or just emotional advice on how to stay hopeful. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you climb out of it?

I have been into personal finance for about 3 years now, but have more so been watching from the sidelines and learning since I haven’t had much income. With this being my first job I should now be able to actually invest consistently and am interested in recommendations on allocations given my goals.

I currently have about $9,000 in a brokerage $7,000 in my Roth, and $3,000 in an HYSA. My car is paid off and I have no debt.

I start my job next month and I’ll make about $90,000 before taxes and deductions. The plan is to contribute 401k and HSA only up to max matching (3% salary and $400 for HSA).

After deductions and taxes I’ll take home around $5,400 per month. I live with my mom and will pay half expenses so expenses will only come out to around $2,000 - $2,300 per month. 

$583 of my income after expenses will certainly go to my Roth so I can max it each year. However, how should I allocate the remaining ~ $2400? I do plan on building my HYSA to more than $3,000. Besides that, should the remainder go to my brokerage, should I increase 401-K/HSA contribution, or continue putting more $ into my HYSA? Are there any other investment tools I should learn about?

personalfinance,"Upside down on car with high interest rate, no principal payment option.","Edit: thank you all questions answered and then some! Love y'all! 


Basically I'm about halfway through a loan for my car and it's worth about 4k with a payoff of 12k, got an insane interest rate when I got the car (26%) due to an old repo that has now been paid in full. all payments on time but principal hasn't moved and when I tried to talk to the bank they basically said my loan is setup to make me pay 100% of the interest before my principal moves at all. 
Car is 2013 Kia soul with engine recall and am super anxious about motor blowing up and me being completely fucked. (No GAP, I know it's horrible) What are my options with this loan? Really looking to get a new vehicle and it seems the ev tax credit can help with negative equity. Unfortunately credit score hasn't really changed since I got this loan. But my total debt has most definitely decreased by about 6-7k income is basically the same as when I got the car around 40-50k per year. Payment is 450 and am able and willing to have a higher payment. (700-800 is totally doable) No down payment money available. Possibly a consignor available. 
I know I got myself into this situation and I should probably just pray I can pay it off without it blowing up. Just looking for any other options/advice if any. Thanks! 
Edit: credit score is 560 negative equity is ~8k

personalfinance,To refinance or sell my car?,"So I have a loaded 2023 Tundra Limited that I bought in January of 23 with a 4 year loan and not that much down. My payments are $1223/month as I wanted to pay it off quickly. I did a budget before the purchase 2 years ago and it'd be tighter then my wife and I have run the budget before but we decided to go for it. Fast forward to nearly 2 years into the loan, I have $30,500 left on it, and the payments are causing issues with the household budget and are stressing the marriage. Value private sale is maybe $50,000 if I can find a buyer in this market. Trade in $48,000ish if I'm lucky. Carmax will give me $46,000 for it. 

If I refinance to a new 4 year loan from now it drops my payments for $1223 to $717 or so but the interest restarts. My CURRENT loan has a 5.49% rate and 2/3'rds of the interest is already paid. A new loan would probably be 6.5-6.79%. 

Alternatively I work more, get a 2nd job or just pick up hours at work. I work in an extremely taxing and stressful profession. My marriage is strained already for a couple reasons, finances being one, work stress (both of our jobs are very stressful), among other things. 

I'm not super keen on working more due to the stress that will put on me and the marriage but I need to figure something out as it was a BIG mistake to buy this years ago and the financial stress is really not good either. 

Do people think I should:

1. Refinance it? Saves paying Sales Tax again, pay a lot more interest. Drop payment by $500-ish for a 48 mo loan or $600 for a 60 month loan. I'd end up paying roughly $3500 more in interest then I'd pay just finishing out my current loan.

2. Trade it in for a cheaper vehicle? I could wheel and deal, trading it in keeps me from paying sales tax again. I could find something for a $500/mo payment or less ideally. 

3. Buckle down and work overtime like crazy to pay it off sooner? OR pick up a couple extra shifts a month to pay for the truck. It's not great either way, one way is 13 weeks of working 3 extra 12 hour shifts a week on top of my 3x12 hour regular shifts. I'd be a walking zombie as I'm already super tired and burnt out after 3x12's for a couple days, but it'd be paid off by next spring. This sounds terrible but I think the marriage would tolerate that better then a few extra shifts a month over the next 2 years which would prolong the fatigue and stress over a longer period of time. 

  
Sadly I do REALLY want a pickup truck, as my wife and I really like going out in to the wilderness to camp and it's super helpful with the dogs as well as for DIY home projects that we are both into but currently can't afford since the truck payment. The truck I have now has everything I'd ever want in one but I just should've done a 7 year loan and made extra payments OR just bought an old beater and not had a payment.

  
What does the collective think?

personalfinance,Preserving wealth while funding a large expense ,"My thought process with this plan stems from what I’ve learned from wealthy people - Use other peoples money when you can (in this case the bank).

Quick run down on my scenario: me 38m, wife 32. Our combined income from day jobs $240k, rental income $36k year net, other income $100k yr. Assets - 401k $455k, IRA’s $246k, Brokerage $50k, crypto $332k, HYSA $80k.

We are planning a major home remodel next year that we’ve budgeted $400k for. We have HELOC’s on our rentals to be able to cover this expense. My grand plan is to ride this current crypto wave and look to cash out the bulk of it around April of next year. Would transition crypto assets over to brokerage. Goal is to have $500k in brokerage invested in blue chip equities. Instead of paying for the remodel with cash / investments, I’d look to use the HELOC initially. Once I have my target amount in brokerage I’d sell covered calls off the portfolio to make monthly payments to the HELOC. Also would use our side income source to pay down the HELOC balance. Goal would be to have the full remodel cost paid off over a three year period. The whole purpose of this is to not deplete too much of our liquid assets, and benefit from the tax advantages with the heloc (tax write offs). 

Does this seem reasonable, or am I way off course here?",1731955352.0
personalfinance,Help: 401K vs. Saving for a House?,"**Question**: Is it irresponsible/unwise to **temporarily** lower HSA and 401K contributions to save for a house in my current situation?  I know the common advice to never touch this--is this a situation where it makes sense to do this?  Conservatively (i.e., not counting any bonuses) if I stopped contributing for 3 years, I would have as much saved as I wanted to have for down payment + reserved savings.  More likely (i.e., based on low-end of bonuses previously received) if I stopped contributing for 2 years, I would have as much as I wanted to have saved.  Add 2 years to each time estimate with no change to contributions.

**Sorry in advance for the long post...really just don't know what to do.  Any and all advice/experience is greatly appreciated.**

**Current Situation**:  In a HCOL area.  Max out HSA and 401K IRS contribution limits; save/invest 27-30% of monthly budget + all stock grants/bonuses; rent is 25% of monthly budget; student loans are 13% of monthly budget; car payment 7% of monthly budget.  ""Monthly budget"" = 2 paychecks, post-tax/withholdings/HSA/401K contributions, so there are 2 ""extra"" paychecks per year that are saved/invested/put towards student loans.  Stock grants and bonuses after taxes = about 18% of annual salary and are saved/invested/put towards student loans.  Don't carry a balance on credit cards. 

I support both myself and my spouse, who hasn't had success job hunting/hasn't had steady employment to reliably contribute to shared recurring expenses since getting an MBA.  Goal is to pay essentially all expenses with one salary (my salary for now or forever, tbd).  We want children in the next year, so  goal would be to save most of my spouse's future income/use it to pay for childcare, or if spouse is unemployed, they'll be the primary caregiver even though that's not exactly what we want/planned.

Like so many others, I've been saving but cost of the houses/areas we're interested in have run up faster than I could save over the past couple years.  Prices are starting to normalize a bit, but they're still quite high.  It seems that we won't be able to have an affordable monthly payment without putting at 20% down, given the interest rates and increasing home insurance costs (plus high property taxes in our area).  

Our apartment is well-priced, but the location is beginning to wear on us (me especially).  My new car has dents and scratches from other careless tenants parking crooked in the lot and hitting whoever is next to them with their car door, there's been a notable increase in crime in the area in the past year, hallways constantly smell like weed and garbage, terrible to go for walks as it's on a main commercial road, and it's hard for me to justify paying more for a 2BR apartment with these conditions. At that point, I'd rather ""go for broke"" and really stretch our budget just to have some peace and be paying into an asset (but I won't actuallyyy do that, hence wanting to beef up down payment/reserve savings...).  The school system in our current town is also not good, but the towns around us where we'd like to buy are excellent.  Also, if my spouse does find employment, we would want to employ an au pair for childcare, which would require being able to provide them with at least their own room, if not their own bathroom.  If we have kids while renting, we will need to pay for daycare which can be more expensive than au pairs in our area, and will also make it more difficult to continue being a 1-car family (which we want to be).   

**Other Info**: I'm pretty disciplined when I create a savings goal--there's really no ""fear"" that I'd plan to save money and that I'd end up spending it.  I don't like the idea of borrowing from my 401K for a down payment because of the rules about paying it back and how changing jobs could affect paying it back.  ",1731955296.0

personalfinance,Should I Cash Out My Pension To Expand Rental Portfolio In Seattle?,"Hi everyone, I’m seeking advice on a financial decision I’m considering. I’m 37 years old and currently own two rental properties in the Seattle area. I’m exploring the idea of cashing out my pension fund to reinvest the funds into another rental property to better hedge against inflation.

Right now, my pension payout is projected to be $525/month when I retire. My concern is that inflation will erode its value significantly over the next few decades. Instead, I’m thinking of parking those funds in a rental property, which might appreciate and generate cash flow that keeps pace with inflation.

However, I’m wrestling with a few questions:

1. What is a typical pension cash-out offer?

2. For those who have been in a similar position,   what made you decide to keep or cash out your pension?

3.	Are there any tax implications or penalties I should consider for cashing out early?

My interest rate is 3.25%. I actually have 8 years left on my mortgage.

I’m a wedding photographer and I sell courses online for other photographers as well. As the title said, I planned on making around $150,000 this year and hit $232,000 before expenses. This seems awesome but my original accountant I learned wasn’t doing the best job and kinda screwed me over on underpaying my quarterly’s and not adjusting when I told her I was making more than anticipated. 

I got a new accountant  because of this and some other unprofessional behavior from my first one, and he is suggesting I submit a late s corp election for 2024 to save a little bit on taxes, and since I’ve honestly been operating similarly to one for years. 

I have paid $20k so far in federal and state taxes, and I guess my question is how much would I owe will I owe in taxes (a rough estimate obviously!) I am an extremely money anxious person and I didn’t grow up in a family making a lot, so I just feel completely lost. I have a lot saved for taxes, I’m just so scared it’s not going to be enough. I have another appointment with my accountant coming up so I can’t ask him all these questions then, but I just need help easing my anxiety until then because it’s all I can’t think about and it’s becoming all consuming for me if I’m being honest. 

For context my expenses are totaling around $65,000 for the year and I live in Arizona. I’ve paid $18,000 so far in taxes.

At the moment I could land job that pays the bills and I’m living with my family. But I have some goals for my future however they are a little hard to achieve. I’m just asking for a realistic budgeting advice.

Goals (ordered in time needed to acomplish)
1-Get my green card ($1450+)
2-Marry my current partner and bring her to the US (later on that)
3-Study and graduate as an electrical engineering (I was studying it back in Cuba)…further on that later

Current salary and expenses:

Monthly (22-23 business days based):

$2300-$2600 
-975 (rent, day-care for my brother, car insurance, etc etc…it’s a fixed amount that my family has to pay the usual bills)
-250–500 (food, electricity bill, gas)
Personal expenses may vary, I usually don’t spend more than 50 monthly, however sometimes I buy stuff for my girlfriend or some stupid gift giving thing at work, so it could go up to 150, but not always.

Further on my goals:
1-the green card should cost around $1450 or may go up a little more, my family is getting some financial help from other relatives so it may vary, but definitely $1450 minimum. 

2-Once I get my green card (I assume could be around august) I want to go to Cuba and marry her, the wedding itself should not be more than 300, we want something simple, the honeymoon could be around 300-400, and the flight to Cuba and back could be around 300-1000 who knows lol, and also I want to go out with her and my friends a little so add 200 more xD. 

After that I want to start all the process for her to get to the us, prices may vary for everything, but definetely we are looking at +$2500 in the whole 1.5-3 years the process could last.

3-Shortly after marrying I want to continue my studies, I want to go 2 years in community college for my associate, and of course asking for student aid, in Miami-Dade College it should not be more than 2k per semester without the financial help. Then I would start with another 2+ years in Florida International University, but who knows if I would have the same job or the same situation.

How to achieve them?

What should I do every time I get paid? How much should I aim to save monthly, I was saving 1200 monthly but at work they told to cut off some of the overtime so I’m now around 800-1000 monthly.

Should I start investing some of that money? At least a little portion? Is there any way to make money online and add up a little? I already feel that I’m behind in my life and my financial situation is horrible, I would be graduating extremely late (I assume 25-26) and I really don’t know how to handle some of the stuff that’s coming

personalfinance,Employer Payroll Not Allowing Me to Reduce My Tax Withholdings By Any Meaningful Amount,"Hi all, I am planning on filing Ch 7 Bankruptcy in Jan or Feb 2025, and my attorney advised me to reduce my tax withholdings as much as possible, because the trustee can take possession of my tax refund as an asset come April tax refund time (for what its worth, my federal tax refund last year was around $2400 and my state refund was around $1200). In other words, I want to have as close to zero tax refund as possible, because the bankruptcy trustee will be able to take it from me. 

My current paycheck withholding is $934 federal and $240 state. Via my employer's online payroll portal, I submitted a new W-4 which literally reduced both federal and state tax withholdings to 0. (Given I only had 4 paychecks left this year when I did this 2 weeks ago, I felt I needed to reduce the withholdings to as close to 0 as possible), in order to align with the estimated total $3600 refund.

However, the paycheck I got this last Friday only had like $10 less withheld! How is it possible to collectively reduce federal and state taxes by $1170, but only had $10 reduction withheld in my paycheck?

I chatted with my employer payroll and they said that my marital status and # of dependents can impact how much the company can legally reduce the withholding for me. FYI I am single and have 0 dependents.

Can anyone shed some light on this and help me out? I want to be confident in my company's payroll, but I feel like they may not know what they are doing.

If I am single and have 0 dependents - and my W-4 is otherwise ""normal"" with no exemptions or anything, is it normal for it to basically be impossible to get any withholding reduction more than a negligible amount (ex. $10....?)

Thanks.",1731872775.0
personalfinance,Would you buy a home in my situation or wait?,"I don't know if I should buy a home now or wait.

I am in my early 30's. I currently gross 157k/year. My job is stable. My credit score is 805. I am single, live alone, and my monthly expenses are $2623, no debts. I have 198k in cash. My net is $8589/month, my gross is $13,097. I rent currently at ~$1500/month which will be going up by 5% when I next renew my lease in a few months. I put 6% of my gross into my 401k which my employer matches, I also max out my HSA pre-tax and put 7500 into a Roth IRA post tax every year. I live in a high income tax state so after everything this leaves me with NET of $7964 per month after taxes and retirement contributions.

I am what you would call frugal, though I don't try to be, I just have a hard time spending money. I currently live well beneath my means. I have no debt. My old car is paid off. Not counting my retirement accounts which I will not be touching for any reason for at least 30 years, I currently have 198k cash saved up rolling into 4 week Treasury bills yielding me 4.589%, this is the easily accessible cash on hand I have intended to use 150k of to purchase a home. Keeping the rest for emergency fund and job loss safety net as I have no friends or family in my life to ask for help if anything in my life goes wrong. I am adding $5341 to this pile every month.

The median price for homes in my area is 655k and they seem to be going up by 3-5% per year. Though this year they are the same as they were last year. If I bought the typical home right now putting 131k as the 20% down-payment assuming an 6.5% mortgage, (I assume if i shop around at least 3 mortgage lenders I can get a 6.5% mortgage rate since they are ~7% today) then my monthly payment will be ~$3871. This includes property taxes, homeowners insurance, mortgage interest and principle, and hoa. 

This would put my debt to income at 30%.

A payment of $3871 feels insane to me, and the Amortization schedule of the loan means I'll be paying in total 1.192 million for a 655k house, so I pay in just interest $668,333. I get that you can refinance assuming rates ever come back to earth, make extra payments, etc etc. to make this less insane.

As far as I can tell this is nearly the worst most expensive time to buy a house in the history of the housing market, and I don't need a house. I am under no pressure to buy. But I have always deeply wanted my own home and I feel like it would massively improve my quality of life. The cheaper houses under the median are very much starter homes and will require a lot of work, I'd rather get something around the median that is move in ready if I decide to buy. If I go down this path I will be a first time home buyer. The way I live right now, I should be able to continue to save around 65k cash each year if I don't buy a house. As for future relationships, I intend to remain childfree by choice. I also intend to remain in the home for at least 15 years maybe forever if I buy.

So, if you were in my situation what would you do?",1731878944.0

personalfinance,Need major help figuring out debt!! ,"Hello! So I have about 16.3k in CC debt (18% interest) and then about 38k debt for my car (5% interest). Not considering those debts in my monthly expenses for bills, I probably pay about $2000 give or take in bills. Not including fun things. (Minimum payments for CC and car are $405 & $705 respectively.) If I truly buckled down I could put $1358 monthly towards the CC and have it paid off in 12 months but that would leave me with not much left over. 

Should I just bite the bullet and pay off the CC? Or should I just try a little over the minimum payment? I've also heard talks about transferring to a different credit card or getting personal loans to pay it off with lower interest. Is there any merit in those options? 

What about debt relief companies? I don't want to shut this credit card down after it's paid off, so I'm not sure exactly what debt relief companies do.

I also want to start investing in ETFs and things that can help me be financially free at some point! I just worry about waiting because I am not getting any younger.

I have a bachelors degree and I have been trying to find a new job that I can turn into a career making at least 6 figures, but I have been struggling to find something.

I have worked in the same medical office the past 6 years, but over that time I have tried to venture out in finding something new to make more money. After graduating, I thought I wanted to go into nursing school so I applied about a year later to a few schools but got denied, then tried another year and got denied again. I then went onto trying e-commerce, and I sold a product online but I failed to make money off of that. I ended up losing money cause I spent so much on inventory, photography, packaging, ads, inspection, and in return there was no profit. I sold all my inventory at a loss and that was the end of that. During that same time, I tried to make some money off crypto, I put in a few thousand but its been a loss, I have been negative for two years now...waiting for it to go back up to cash out evenly. Then, I got my loan license in my state thinking I can start doing that and make money but the market is extremely difficult in my area, and I was getting 0 leads. I have applied to thousands of jobs in my area, on and off for 3 years and rarely get a call back. I updated my resume with the help of Chat GPT and perfected it using the STAR method, thinking I would for sure get called back but still nothing. I am having a hard time getting hired which is so confusing to me cause I'm not sure how it is possible to apply to thousands of jobs and not get a call back? 3 years ago I opened up a ROTH and contributed what I could at the time but I stopped last year cause I can't contribute at the moment. I want to make at least 10k/mo and go up from there, I feel like I've tried a variety of things to be successful.

**What Happened?**

Today I started getting warning lights on my car that the transmission was having issues, took the car to a shop and they confirmed it would be about $5,000, about half of what the cars worth is on Blue Book. Not wanting to invest that amount of money back into the car, I sold it for around 8K.

I am looking to buy a car, and wanted to get some different perspectives outside of my family.

**Financials**

32 years old, make about 105,000 salary, living in DMV area (my exact location is not the highest cost of living in the DMV, I will call it moderate).

I save 1,200 - 1,500 a month without intensely trying to budget.

I have 70k in a HYSA , 15k in investments, and do not own property yet - although that is a shorter term goal if the housing market settles down.

I have no debt

I am not looking to buy anything frivolous, like an expensive sports car, but would like something ""nice"".

**Questions**

1. Am I insane for thinking it is a good idea to be looking in the price range of 20-25k for a used car with where I am at financially? This would be \~12-17K out of pocket (plus taxes and titles).
2. If the above is not absolutely insane, should I pull the entire amount out of savings and pay in full in cash? Do I finance the entire remainder cost? Or a hybrid approach where I would only pull out half of the amount of what's needed and finance the rest? My previous car was fully paid for, so I am not sure how I feel about adding a large monthly bill that was not present before.

Some stocks for Bonds since Trump‘s gonna be in office I don’t understand all the trade stuff but it seems like anytime you get anybody else involved no matter win or  lose they’re gonna take their share, of course I wouldn’t mind if I’m way ahead, though that’s if I picked the right outfit.
I do still owe on a house about 60 grand but I’m into the last 10 years of the loan and understand that they’ve already raped me at the beginning so probably shouldn’t pay that all off. If I could I got one vehicle that I only owe 15,000 on and that’s about it so should I just blow the money on middle aged toys and enjoy them and sell them while they’re still sellable or put some money in stocks or bonds or mutual funds

Mid-30's, work at a startup in human resources and project management capacity. Was making right at $60k/yr, but in January my salary will become mid-$80's.

Exciting, right? Unfortunately, company health is a bit questionable -- my increase in salary is coming as a result of greatly increased responsibility. My immediate supervisor is being let go basically for being too expensive (several times my own salary), other layoffs have occurred, fundraising is ongoing. Certainly the company will look much different in a year.

I have never been in such a position before, in fact this is my first for-profit org for which I have ever worked, and I could use some on advice on how to protect myself in this stage of uncertainty even as my income increases. My original plan was to sock away nearly 100% of this raise to retirement savings -- max out my Roth IRA and contribute as much as I could to Trad 401k to achieve the same take-home as I currently have, effectively meaning no expendable income gain at all. But with the state of the organization, I am wondering if I might want to hedge by having a bit more cash.

Here's my current budget situation:

* Area: MCOL
* Retirement Contribution: **15% to Roth 401k -- no match**
* Take-home: $3360 (insurance premium 100% covered by company)
* Shared Expenses w/ Partner $1700/mo (I pay the amount listed, which is half. So for savings contribution consider it grows at twice the rate I contribute.)

personalfinance,Advice Needed: Should We Move Next to My Mom’s House and Sell Our Current Home?,"My wife and I are considering buying the house right next to my mom's. She’s our babysitter and watches our child for free, but right now, we drive about 40 minutes each way to drop him off before work. Our current house is valued around $400,000 (we bought it for $280,000 at a 3% interest rate with a VA loan). Our monthly payment is about $2,000. If we sold now, we’d probably net around $130,000 after realtor fees, thanks to the improvements we’ve made.

The house next to my mom is listed at $210,000, though I think we could negotiate it down to $200,000. It needs some work, but I know a solid contractor who lives a few houses down. I’d likely set aside around $20,000 for initial renovations. However, the local public schools aren’t highly rated, which is a concern. There’s a good private school nearby, though, with tuition around $6,000 a year until high school, where it increases to $12,000 annually.

One hesitation I have is due to a major construction project planned near our current home — one of the biggest developments in the area. This project could significantly increase our home’s value over time, so I’m worried about potentially leaving money on the table by selling too soon.

On the other hand, moving next to my mom would mean a lower mortgage at around 6% with a VA loan, making our new monthly payment roughly $800 — saving us $1,200 each month. We could even opt for a 15-year loan and still have manageable payments.

Help with understanding how to spend or save large amounts of money without running out, and why? How do people spend responsibly on big things?

We need help figuring out how to spend money. We used to figure out if we could buy something depending on how much money was in our account (not much at the time) but we could never get ahead that way, and freqentlygot im trouble with unexpected expenses. It was understandable when we only made a little, but we kept doing it even when ourpaycheck got better.

Now we finally figured out a weekly budget and for the most part don't go over that for small discretionary spending, but we got ourselves in trouble again by started an urgent building project with all our extra money, then being stuck home for a storm, missing work for being sick, and then both cars breaking at the same time. Now we have bills coming due that we can't pay on time, even though we make plenty of money. We're down to ""beans and rice"" again (and a few other things).

We've figured out budgetting day to day stuff for the most part, but how do people with lots of money budget the big things? How do you plan for large expenses like taxes or unexpected business expenses? How do you gradually get ahead?

Budgetting used to seem like arbitrarily picking limits to spend on certain things,and now I view it a lot differently as living within our means, planning for small unexpected expenses, etc. But now I'm having a hard time with how to approach large amounts of money and large expenses. Now that we're budgetting the small stuff, we can do the big stuff. But what else is it for? Why not soend all of it, other than an emergency fund? How much is the right amount to save versus spend? It all seems arbitrary to me again. A weekly budget makes sense now, because it's not arbitrary. I finally understand spending less than what you make, instead of whatever you have on hand. But the big stuff is confusing. 

How do people gradually become more wealthy without spending everything? Isn't the point of weekly and monthly budgetting so that you spend on big things? If we're saving extra for unexpected things, how much do we plan for? Is it arbitrary? I really need help with this conceptually. I know I'm missing something.",1731947739.0

personalfinance,Paying off all debt as soon as possible ,"Hey all looking for some advice 

My boyfriend and I are slowly paying off our debt. I am in my final semester of college and he has been helping me pay for school out of pocket. I put each payment on my credit card and then pay it off but of course due to other expenses my credit card is currently sitting at 3K. He has almost 9K on his credit card. Now in the spring I will have exactly 3 payments of about $450 that will be added to the card but we have been worried about his card growing so much so we are trying to decide on the best game plan for us. 

I make $2400 a month and he makes $2600 a month, our rent is $950. Starting this next month I will start paying all expenses in our house (besides his car payment, $270) and he will put his entire paycheck towards his card with the exception of his car payment. My school payments will be added to my card and I will pay the minimum balance due. It will take 4 months to pay off his card this way and after that we will switch and he will pay all expenses (besides my car payment, $273) at that point my card will be at at least 5K so it will take me at most 3 months to pay off my card. 

He has no phone payment and I pay $80 a month for my own phone plan (I have a separate bucket that I add money into each month so this can be left alone to pay for itself), all utilities except electric included in our rent, which is usually around $100 a month and internet is $80 a month. We are budgeting to keep $150 from each paycheck in our accounts for gas and groceries. We are prepared to be extremely frugal and do what it takes to pay this off as fast as we can. My younger sister also lives with us and she pays $280 a month for rent and electric as well. ",1731947561.0

personalfinance,College 529 Funds - rolling over to IRA,"So this post is not about the new rules in regards to 529 and rolling over to IRA but more about the tax scenarios involving earned income and how that affects contribution limits.

You can contribute - whatever is lesser of the two - your total earned income amount or the IRS-mandated contribution limit for a year. Separately, tax filing thresholds are almost twice what the contribution limit is for any given year. So, hypothetically, how would the IRS know if you max the IRA contribution limit from a college 529 rollover vs just against what you earned as income if you don't have to file a tax return?

EXAMPLE:

Earned Income: $4K   IRA Contribution Limit: $10K    Tax Filing Threshold: $15K    529 Funds: $100K

I roll $10K from my 529 funds into a Roth IRA - how would the IRS know I'm only supposed to rollover $4K if I don't  have to file a tax return? Say my earned income is all cash.

Perhaps the question is more general than relating to a 529 fund. I'm currently looking into opening a few for my kids so this was a question I was pondering.",1731947403.0

I make 80K at this role, in side contracts about 30K a year which keeps me just a hair into the 24% tax bracket even if I maxed out the traditional 401K to lower my taxed income.

personalfinance,Enterprise/National Accident with no Insurance,"Hello, just looking for some guidance. A couple of weeks ago I flew home and rented a car from National picking the Emerald Isle option. There was a BMW X1 in the isle that they let me take for the same price. The next day, after burning the candle at both ends traveling, I was on my way to my aunts house and I fell asleep at the wheel. I ended up going into the median and I hit a dirt mound that caused front end damage and caused the airbags to deploy (see images). Overall I know its bad; I had a 2007 Silverado totaled due to a fender bender that you could barely notice last year, quoted $7,000 in repairs, so I can only imagine what this level of damage would cost on a BMW.

On the scene, OnStar (or something) came on asking if I was ok and that they were sending help. I got out of the car.... fine. I'm still fine, no concussion, etc.. The only lingering issue is the guilty overthinking of what could have happened... but that's a different discussion. On scene the officer came out and we did a sobriety test, blew a 0, and I admitted fault. She wrote me a $185 Reckless Driving ticket which I paid the next morning, but otherwise, everything was fine.

The next day I started digging into my rental details and discovered that that rental, and every rental I've had over the last 3 years (quite a few), has had all the insurance options declined. I have a code on my account from work (a perk) that I had always assumed took care of the insurance, but I guess it doesn't and I opted out of all the insurance options when setting up my online account with National, so when I go to reserve a rental online, it never asks. I currently live out of the country so I have no personal auto insurance, because I have no vehicle in the US. Luckily, I have a Chase Amazon Visa that I used to rent the car and in talking with them over a few day period, discovered that they are able to be the primary insurer with an uploaded *Statutory Declaration of no personal auto insurance.* The Credit Card states that it covers up to $60,000 in damages on non-exotic vehicles not valued over $125,000 USD. A 2025 BMW X1 is a small-luxury SUV that MSRPs around $42k to $52k. In the details, I dont see anything that would disqualify them covering me and I've already began the process with them

So how screwed am I?

Worst case the vehicle is a total loss? If that happens I imagine I'd basically have to buy the car if the card above for whatever reason doesn't do anything. If its repairable then I'd be directly responsible for all and any costs?

Lets say worse case, total loss, and I have a $50k bill to pay. Do I take the credit hit (currently 825) and settle the debt in collections? Do I just kiss my savings goodbye (which could cover the cost of one of those vehicles) and see the silver lining of still not having any debt?

Is there anything I could do in the aftermath? Lawyers or something. Work with my old insurance carrier to see if they can help, etc. I'm still waiting to hear back, so I have no idea what is to come numerically speaking.

Any guidance or advice would be appreciated, especially if it is from your own personal experience.",1731945963.0

Do I make 10% overpayments now until expiry of current mortgage term to lower the principal and simultaneously save up for a deposit...?

Or do I just carry on saving for the next property, not overpay, and just remortgage the HTB loan in 2027?

Dilemma is obviously rates are going to be much higher than when originally mortgaged. So likely to be around 5% when I remortgage in 2027. So do I just lower the principal now and not pay the hefty 20% equity loan, and just keep saving for another deposit

Or

Don't do overpayments, don't pay loan in 2027, keep saving for deposit and just buy another house and rent this one out when the term expires - this provides highest cash flow in the short term. Trouble with this is the impact of adding the 20% loan amount to the principal to a much higher interest rate

* Long term disability is four times more expensive (for me) through a 3rd party vs a group policy at work.  The logic of ""you could lose your job, and therefore lose your insurance"" convinced me to switch from group to term for life insurance.  But I'm not sure if it's worth the cost for disability.
* If you have decent 401k savings, can or should you rely on ""hardship withdraws?"" instead of insurance.  I could contribute the amount that would be going to disability insurance to my 401k instead.

I made the plan to ask for a loan that'll pay off my credit card, cover my negative equity in my car to sell, and buy a cheap vehicle outright to cut all my monthly payments down to just the mortgage and loan.

In your experiences, would going to a credit union be my best option at getting someone to approve this? Is it even feasible going this route? Would they help me get things straightened back out so I can stop stressing and focus on this baby? ",1731922357.0

I am an Australian citizen moving to an EU country where I also hold citizenship. I have never lived there before, but have visited. I will have a passport but I need to live there for a minimum of 6 months before I can obtain an ID card which is an official form of identification there. 

I will be needing to apply for a personal (student) loan from a bank in the EU country. This loan may be (and is allowed to be) used for study abroad (ie. outside of the EU country). 

Can you foresee, generally, any issues I may have in obtaining a loan if I have just moved to this country? My view is that if I am a citizen, I should have access to these funds, but I do worry that it will not be looked upon favourably that I have just arrived. I want to prepare myself for any possible issues arising.

personalfinance,Got fooled by my dealer at 40K mile service,"I took my car into the dealership for the 40k mile service, which I thought would be a simple maintenance check. The plan was for them to change out a few fluids, rotate the tires, and do a brake wear test—nothing too out of the ordinary. But by the time I walked out of there, I was over $2200 poorer, and I’m honestly feeling pretty frustrated about it.

I was dealing with a very senior service dealer who got me to agree to things I probably didn’t need I think, making it seem like I’d be making a huge mistake if I didn’t go along with it. He said I would be a fool if I didn't get these serviced as per his instructions and made me listen to him. Looking back, I feel like I got played—like he used that smooth talk to push me into extra services that didn’t need to be done right away.  


Let me account what was done:

40K service – $798.30

Right engine mount replaced (found leaking) – $337.52

Battery replaced (failed their test, despite the fact that it showed no signs of problems to me) – $213.00

Tail Lights replaced – $64.40

Drive belts replaced (upon inspection, found one starting to crack) – $196.38

Oil Cooler replaced (leaking oil in coolant) – $369.48

Cooling system flush (necessitated by the leaky oil cooler) – $263.58

personalfinance,Am I over leveraging on my monthly payments?,"In over my head with monthly payments?

Hello Reddit,

I am married, 24 years old, and I’m currently making ~$108,000 annually with RSUs for around $50,000 this year, and an annual bonus of around $10,000. 

Post- tax I take home around 4000 a month with 401k, and closer to $6700 without. 

I recently purchased a home for around ~400k, with a monthly payment of 3100. I was previously renting at 2100. 

Pre-tax 401k - ~$2000

House 7% - $3100 (400k remaining)
car 8% - $860. (39,000 remaining)
Utilities - $500. 
Student loans - $400 (25k remaining)

Unvested RSU value: $175,000

Is this over leveraging? I am afraid with a near 50% contribution to 401k while I will max in June next year for the first few months I will only be making ~4000 a month. 
Also, with kids I’m worrying about starting HSA contributions for daycare from pre-tax money. 

How would you handle your contributions? Is this too much monthly?

Do you have any suggestions for how I can improve my situation?

My priorities are getting out of debt as quickly as possibly so I can enjoy the income, and behind saving seriously without a constant monthly drain on my head. Work is enough.

personalfinance,Am I overthinking this? ,"I’m 31 years old and plan to retire between the ages of 55 and 60. I would like to retire earlier, but I’m not sure if it will be possible. Currently, I rent and do not own a home or any rental properties. I’m trying to save for a home. I earn about $60,000 annually pre-tax, and my wife earns $29,000 annually post-tax. Together, we take home approximately $3,000–$3,200 per month. We live in Georgia.

I contribute 15% of my paycheck to a 401(k) biweekly, and my employer provides a 6% company match. My total retirement savings currently sit at $66,000: $9,000 in a Roth IRA and $56,000 in my 401(k), which is a Roth 401(k). My wife has about $3,000 in a Roth IRA, and that’s her only retirement account. We try to max out our Roth IRAs each year, but it’s sometimes challenging. Depending on the year, we might contribute $3,000, $5,000, or $7,000 in total.

My wife drives a 2023 Toyota Corolla with 26,000 miles on it, which is fully paid off. I drive a 2024 Corolla Hybrid with 13,000 miles. I could pay it off today, but that would leave us with only $6,000 in our bank account. We are prioritizing building our savings to $10,000 before paying off the car. Once my car is fully paid off, we’ll be debt-free and able to save aggressively for a home.

If all goes as planned, I’ll become a registered nurse in 2025, and my wife plans to enroll in dental hygienist school that same year.

My main concern is whether my investments are on track. Am I balanced enough? Are my fund choices the best available? What would you do differently? I’m 31 and feel worried that I haven’t yet reached the $100,000 mark in retirement savings.

personalfinance,Taxable Brokerage versus 401K loan for remainder of down payment.,"We are building a new home, which is now ahead of schedule due to the two homes in front of ours either changing lots or not getting approved for financing. We do not need to sell our current home to qualify for our new home. We went into pre-approval with nearly all savings in our bank that would be put towards 20% down payment with some rolled into higher rate CD's that were set to mature the month prior to our original build date. We were told to expect some delays due to building over winter months, which is why the CD's were reinvested for another 6 month window before we signed our contract.

All good problems to have except that now being ahead of schedule means we are going to be short 25K or so with most of that from the extra two months of savings missed and the CD's. We fully fund our retirement, and would be able to repay a 401K loan in the coming year giving us more of a cushion if needed.  This is what my dad had initially advised if we were short on funds or if build went quicker than expected. However I have 45K in taxable brokerage mostly in SCHB and some initial firms from starter investing before I moved to ETF, these have turned a good profit since the pandemic and all are now firmly back in gains territory ranging from 13% to 117%.

I know I'd pay myself back the 401K loan interest, but wouldn't it be better to sell the taxable shares in 2025 which would mean the 15% long term gains tax would be due in 2026 and keep the 401K in market? I could then reinvest out of the original holdings fully into SCHB or redistribute from lower profit stock no longer of interest and it would lock in some of the profits earned in past 5+ years. This taxable account is long term holdings for retirement or additional savings cushion as an extended emergency fund as I also have a deferred compensation plan to augment any early retirement and most of my extra funds go there to the maximum each year.

No one can predict the market, and with recent election, the interest rates and other movement has been all over the place so just want to ensure I am not missing an obvious benefit or reason to take out the 401K loan versus cover any shortage if they remain ahead of schedule with the taxable holdings.

I doubt based on the current timelines if the schedule at this point would fluctuate more than a month and go back to original dates, so just trying to be ready for having to fund ahead of the CD maturity dates.

personalfinance,Pledged Asset Line for home purchase,"I have been investing for a while now and one of my accounts has a value of about $500k with a cost basis of roughly $150k . Within the next six months, I will likely need $250k for a down payment on a home but I am concerned about the up-front tax hit. The account is at Schwab and I was looking into a pledged asset line. My understanding is that a PAL does not show up on a credit report and I am free to use this money as down payment with no impact to my DTI ratio with the bank/mortgage company. 



I am considering pledging the full account and draw $250k for down payment with the intention to liquidate roughly $50k annually the next five years to spread out the capital gains tax hit and pay back the draw. I want to see if others has done the same with a PAL and if there is anything you would do differently? Maybe liquidate a different amount annually ($25k? $10k?) instead and spread out the loan even longer? Other than spreading out the taxes, another reason that I want to put myself on a liquidation schedule is to mitigate the risk of a black swan event where my portfolio declines over 50% and I'm stuck in a situation where I need to transfer funds from another account to Schwab to have sufficient collateral.



Another question I have is if it makes sense for me to pledge the full account? Since I only need $250k, would it make sense for me to pledge about $350k and draw the full available $250k (\~70%)?",1731889512.0

personalfinance,Car & renters insurance recommendation,"I’ve been so frustrated with insurance the last few years. I have a nearly perfect driving record, a nearly perfect credit record, and I’m in my early 60s, which is an age auto insurers don’t worry about much. But the cheapest insurance I could find, for the lowest level of coverage my state allows (25/50/25), was $83 a month. I kept comparing rates on comparison sites, and even talking to actual agents, and rates barely varied at all. And I was low key always stressed about having such skeletal coverage. It seemed every resource I checked — especially insurance agents — thought I should have much, much more. 

So it was with low expectations that I followed a link to get a quote from Lemonade, which is an insurer I’d never heard of. Their site was easy to use, easy to understand, and there was zero pressure. (Apparently all customer service with Lemonade is AI.) I found that with them, I could double my coverage AND get underinsured motorist protection for about the same as I’d been paying GEICO (and Allstate before them) for half the coverage.

personalfinance,Wife is in hospice. We expect some monetary gifts that will be put to our children' 529 plans. Lots of questions.,"So as the title, my lovely wife (35F) has started hospice two days ago after fighting colon cancer for the past 3.5 years. We have 3 young boys (5YO, 3.5YO, 3.5YO). Due to costly medical procedures, we have never had extra money to put aside for the their education. We are expecting gifts (a few hundreds to a few thousands dollars) from relatives/friends. We already have funeral fund reserved, so we want to set this money aside for college if they so choose in the future. I have been researching for the past few weeks regarding 529 plans for our state Maryland.

However, there are a few questions I still have:

* Should I go with Maryland 529 plans instead of Nevada (or any other states) 529 plans? NV 529 seem to have the best reviews/recommendations due to their low fees, better yield/returns for investment. Going with MD 529 plans, I will have $2500/child tax deduction, which seem to be a minimal benefit compared to the better yield rates of NV 529 plans. MD 529 is administered by T. Rowe Price.
* It seems that I can open an umbrella 529 plan under my name (36 year-old) and name our kids as beneficiaries. Would that help with their Financial Aid situation in anyway? Any benefits of doing that instead of individual 529 plans for each child? From my understanding, if they have assets (529 plans under their names) during the FAFSA application, their Financial Aid amount will be smaller. I don't want to take advantage of the system, but I also want the best potential support for my children and maximize the value of our investment.
* If I choose MD plans, should I avoid MD's prepaid trust plan? It seems great on paper, but so many parents have issues getting money. Is that still an issue?
* Any other plans I should look at? Opening a 529 plans with Vanguard seems to be a pretty good investment as well. MD 529 (ran by T. Rowe Price) has higher fee (.64%) than Vanguard (.03%).
* My wife has been staying at home for the past 7 years, so she has insufficient social credits. Hence, the children will not get any survivor benefits. I am on my own to support them, which I have no complaints about. I just want to ensure the best possible future for them.

Thank you in advance.

As a result, our payment is about $1700 a month. It is a VA loan. With all the renovations we have done to our home it is valued at approximately $330,000 now we would make roughly $116,000 after paying Realtor fees. The house next to my mom is being asked for about 190,000 but I think we could negotiate down to 180,000. It needs a lot of work, but the schools are really not good in that neighborhood. There is a good private school nearby and the tuition there is 5000 a year until high school that it’s 10,000 a year. I would probably keep out 15,000 for renovations and the guy who renovated our house happens to like three houses down. I’m nervous because they’re putting in one of the biggest mega sites ever in any state for construction right by my current house. That skyrocket the value of my house then I’m worried that I would be making a mistake by selling too soon.

personalfinance,Rent vs buy when escaping foreclosure?,"Hello! If this is above Reddit’s pay grade I would love at least a direction to head in re: how to vet potential financial advisors.

So unfortunately the home I live in, owned by my mother, has been encumbered by a loan that is too large and has too short a deadline to be paid off (hard money lender). The foreclosure process hasn’t begun yet but it likely will by mid-next-year.

My cousin and I, combined, take home about $6,800/month after taxes + insurance and before any expenses.

The COL in our area is fairly high, so we can easily spend around $700/month on groceries alone for just the two of us before cat food and supplies. We already cook at home, and I usually eat fresh vegetables and canned goods, no meat, to try and pinch as many pennies as possible. Cousin requires a little more variety, so she eats meat, but overall we stick to versatile pantry ingredients. Internet is $100/month, phones are $120/month, and due to our current poor insulation, utilities are about $400/month and will likely go up as things get colder. We only drive to work, to the grocery store, and home, and gas is about ~$100/month.

We currently support my mother in full. She has no active source of income, and her bankruptcy should end in about 7 months. What we could be paying towards a mortgage is currently going towards storage units for things that were once held in a second house that has since been sold out of necessity. Money from that sale has been spent.

For my cousin and I, everything NOT OPTIONAL calculated together, including $30/mo in subscriptions and $130/mo for cat food and supplies but not including a possible rent/mortgage, our baseline lives cost $1,830/month to maintain.

For my mother, including her specific bills, subscriptions, health debt, gas, and groceries, her baseline is ~$1,350/month.

Storage fees are about $2,800/month. Assistance with these fees come from various one-off gifts from friends and family that are thankfully more well off.

Since the home we live in is definitely unaffordable, we have a disagreement regarding what the best option is for what housing everyone should move into.

My mother has no savings to speak of. She invested everything that divorce from my father didn’t take into starting a business, which failed. Any money she has is from either me and Cousin, or one-off handouts from friends and family.

My mom’s plan is as follows: Cousin and I purchase a fixer-upper house, which would cost up to $3,500/mo including mortgages and insurance (one mortgage for the purchase and one to cover the down payment; total depends on what we offer and what is accepted) but not utilities and I don’t believe taxes. There is no HOA to contend with. We pare down storage contents and dump the remaining objects into it. My mom moves in there, cousin and I follow temporarily. Mom improves a closed off section of the house with help from some connections she has (paid for by BARTER, not anything from us kids), and rents it out to cover the mortgage. After that is settled she would find her own employment in the nearby city. The moment my mother’s bankruptcy ends, we hand the rights to and monetary responsibilities of the house over to her and leave for our own apartment.

She is extremely domineering, opinionated, and difficult to live with long-term, so unless I would save up enough to retire by continuing to share a house with her, my immediate first move once possible would be to rent somewhere else with my cousin.

We could also just tell my mom we refuse to buy this house, and tell her that we could pay for part of her life, maybe a small apartment, some groceries, and her bills, but that would be the extent of our assistance. The average two-bedroom apartment in our area would be around $2,400/mo, not including utilities or any extra fees that apartment-hunt websites secretly omit.

My mom insists that it will always be more beneficial to everyone to own a property with a rental income, and NEVER rent from somewhere else. I understand where she is coming from, but I would prefer an option where I can disconnect from her and start reliably having my own savings. I already gave what few thousands I had squirreled away to support mom years ago—we’ve had monetary issues for ages. I can’t advance in my life without getting my savings built back up.

She very likely will not sell the current house before it enters foreclosure—she insists on trying to fight the financers in court. We can assume any extra money from selling it will not be available.

So, assuming we all do the same things we are currently doing, just without any storage, which option would most likely provide more financial security in the long term?

* Cousin and I purchase house with up to $3,500/mo mortgage + insurance, live there and wait for it to be monetized, then hand off to my mother after 7 months-1 year so we can move out
* Cousin and I scale back assistance we provide and move into our own apartment as soon as possible, with $2,400/mo rent before utilities, with housing for my mother going anywhere between $900/mo to $1,400/mo depending on where she lives and before she gains employment or housing assistance

personalfinance,Rolling over from 401K to IRA?,"Hi all, I switched jobs last July and finally got around to looking into a new 401K. I’ll be transitioning from Guideline to Morgan Stanley. The issue is that the Guideline is a traditional 401K, and the new Morgan Stanley account is a simple IRA. I have about $10,000 in the Guideline account, but they said I’m not allowed to roll it over until it hits 2 years of the simple IRA being open. Unfortunately, I have a little monthly fee with Guideline, and obviously I get taxed the 20-25% if I withdraw the money without rolling over. They said my choices are:
1) Make a second regular IRA account with them, roll over from Guideline 401K into that
2) Keep the money in Guideline account for 2 years

personalfinance,Pro-Rata rule can sometimes be desirable?,"I have read a lot about the pro-rata rule (in the context of Backdoor Roth) and this is my current understanding. It is not a penalty, nor is it double taxation. It is effectively just converting pre-tax money into post-tax money, which seems to be not always ""bad"" depending on your financial goals. If you have pre-tax dollars sitting in a IRA account, pro-rata rule will trigger when the backdoor roth is executed. But that means over time, the basis in that IRA account increases, meaning that in the future you have to pay less taxes on that money upon withdrawal (because your increasing your basis). Building up basis over time can be a legitimate financial strategy. So then my question is, why is the pro-rata rule always frowned upon and tried to be avoided, any why does no one ever discuss the benefit (building up basis)?",1731875264.0

personalfinance,Feedback/Confirmation on 403(b) Rollover Plan,"Hello!

I’m in the process of rolling over my 403(b) from my employer and wanted to confirm a few details and get some feedback on my plan:

* The 403(b) is currently with Lincoln Financial, and I plan to roll it over to Fidelity.
* Approximately $25K is in Roth, and $4K is in pre-tax employer match.
* To avoid commingling the funds, I intend to roll the $4K pre-tax employer match into a rollover IRA (Lincoln has confirmed they will distribute these separately).
* The $25K Roth balance will be deposited into a new Roth IRA (I already have an existing Roth IRA with Fidelity).

I’d appreciate confirmation that the pre-tax funds should go into a rollover IRA, not a traditional IRA (and any clarity on the difference would be great). Additionally, I’m assuming it makes sense to open a completely new Roth IRA for the Roth rollover funds—this is the guidance I’ve received from Fidelity reps, but I just want to double-check to ensure everything looks correct and consider any other factors.

personalfinance,My Friend Overpaid on His Mortgage Due to Hidden Fees Could He Be a Victim of a Mortgage Scam?,"I'm looking for some advice on behalf of a friend who recently went through a rough experience with his mortgage. He was excited about buying his first home, but the process ended up costing him a lot more than he anticipated, and he’s now worried he might have been taken advantage of.

Here’s what happened:

When he first signed up with the lender, he was quoted a certain interest rate and monthly payment. But as he got further into the process, he started seeing additional “administrative fees” and “rate lock fees” pop up, which weren’t discussed upfront. By the time he closed, he had paid thousands more than he originally budgeted for.

He’s also been charged “early payment penalties” for trying to make extra payments toward the principal to pay off the loan faster. He’s feeling frustrated and uncertain if this is standard in the mortgage industry or if he got scammed.

Questions for the community:

1. **Are these kinds of fees normal in mortgage agreements?** What kinds of charges should homebuyers expect, and what should be a red flag?
2. **Can he dispute any of these charges?** Is there any way to request an audit or speak to a consumer protection agency to look into whether he was overcharged?
3. **What steps can he take to avoid these issues in the future?** For those who’ve been through the mortgage process, any tips on spotting hidden fees and negotiating better terms?

He’s feeling pretty discouraged and doesn’t want others to make the same mistakes. Any insights or advice from folks who’ve dealt with similar situations would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1731868802.0

Nothing would make me happier either if I'm being honest, but I'm looking at my budget and what's available, and it's just not looking possible. 

Can anyone who owns a home, help me out with figuring out a reasonable budget for a home. I currently make about $70k after taxes. My current rent is $1100 and I don't want a mortgage any higher than that because I know home repairs can get expensive fast. I'm currently saving about $350 a month for a down payment and have saved $40k so far. The only utilities that I pay at my apartment are internet and electric so I know that $350 a month I'm saving would easily be eaten up by other utilities as well as a higher electric bill, especially if it's electric heat. 

I'm looking at my budget and I feel like I'm doing all the right things, I have no debt, I'm saving for retirement & insurance & a modest vacation every year and a half & all the other yearly expenses. I have some extra fun money to spend on hobbies, but when I look at my budget, I spend less than 2% on my hobbies. I live fairly frugally, but I also know that even though I'm saving for car repairs and have been able to cover those in the past, if I had to buy a new car right now and take out a loan for it, it would be a very tight budget and I would be stressing.

personalfinance,Prudential Long Term Care Bond,"Hello,  
  
I’m keen to hear if anyone has experience with, or knowledge about, Prudential's Long Term Care Bond. This product was originally purchased by my grandparents in 1997 under its former name, the Scottish Amicable Long Term Care Bond.

In 2020 we completed the sale of my grandparents’ home after my grandfather passed away and my grandmother moved into a care home. It seems that both of them held policies, but the capital amount was significantly lower than the £20,000 each had invested in 1997.

Given the product’s name, I had assumed it was designed to help cover care home fees if one spouse entered care after the other passed away. This is precisely the situation we are now facing. However, we haven’t had any communication from Prudential in the past four years. We also haven’t received any statements, details of key benefits, or other relevant updates regarding the product.  


The original documentation we have indicates some sort of £20,000 per annum payout, but it does not clarify under what circumstances or when this would be claimable.

There are a few articles online, whereby people had issues in receiving the investment value: See Guardian Article, from 2007 titled: Long-term care bond victory.

Current combined income month AFTER taxes: Oct-May $11,210 is and May-Oct is $10,250. Fluctuation reason is bc health insurance only gets deducted for 6 months out of the year from husbands paycheck. 

Currently own a home at 2.4% interest rate and have $170k left on the payoff. Current payment is $1049 per month. Super cheap I know.  

Found a new house I absolutely love. New mortgage payment after 20% down and considering the high interest rate now would be somewhere between 2,500-2,600/month factoring in taxes and homeowners insurance. 

We have 2 car payments, a camper payment, and other smaller debts. I’ve ran the numbers and it appears that we can afford it, while still being able to save 1k per month, but it’ll be tight. We also have 3 kids; one older barely adult, one heading to college soon and one in junior high. 

Husband will be getting promoted in January which will come with approx an additional +500 per month, plus ancompany truck and fuel paid for. And I receive general salary increase every July 3% which will be another $300 per month, approx.

I don’t want to bank on any increases though. And I don’t want to lower my savings amount per month. 

Here is why we’re considering the move. I am spending a ridiculous amount of time driving to the school multiple times a day for sports, anything is 15-20 mins away (we live rural).

We drilled a new well a few years ago but still during periods of drought it becomes a weekly issue that puts an undue burden on my husband. I could drill another well again, but there is never a guarantee we will hit good water enough to sustain this many people in our household. And I hate conserving water. I realize now we can buy whatever, save a lot , and go on trips, etc. but this is the trade off.

Credit score: 770s

Debt: Around 60k (20k student loans, 30k new car which was absolutely necessary, unfortunately.)

Savings: $45k (I save $3k a month. Goal: $100k.)

Salary: $86k 

401k: Not positive. I believe under $10k. (I match my companies 5% which I believe gives me $300 a month.)

HSA: $1k (I get $200 a month from my employer.)

Thats all. My goal is to continue saving as much money as I can to aid in my retirement & future investments (like a house). 

I know it isnt too bad but I am so anxious that I am not doing more, I know I can do more, I just have a severe gap in knowledge. I see people post about having $700k in investments or stocks & I feel behind. Speaking of S&P500, bitcoin & beyond. I dont even know if that means they have $700k to their name fully or just hypothetically because its a stock. I grew up in poverty so I taught myself everything. I feel the knowledge I am missing is what isnt easily taught/told to do by, say, Google. 

What else can I do to better at, or add to my portfolio? If you recommend investing, could you please give me a resource I can start reading into? I am so new to stocks, I dont want to go in & waste money.

Much appreciated. Apologies if this comes off frantic. I have had anxiety for a month about this but today I woke up with chest pain & said enough is enough.

personalfinance,Right amount to dollar cost average?,"28m - I’ve got about 127k in cash right now as I was saving up for a down payment on a house. Plans changed and I find it no longer reasonable to buy a property for various reasons. That said I need to burn down some idle funds to my 6month emergency saving amount but I’m worried about dumping large sums into my brokerage account (the bogle way so it only consists of index funds).

personalfinance,Would it be a bad move to purchase a home in this financial situation?,"My significant other and I are in our early 30s and have been considering purchasing our first home but we are very unsure as to how to gauge what would be considered affordable without becoming house poor.

We live in a high cost of living state (Hawaii) and have been renting the same place since mid 2020.

Current rent: $1800 + Electric (\~$200)  + Gas stove (\~$40) + Water (\~$80). In terms of rent, it is a very good deal, everything nearby for rent for a similar space and size is easily 2.2k+ at the minimum. Since mid 2020 our rent has only gone up $50/month with the addition of paying for water which we originally weren't. Landlord is great, they are aware we are planning to look for a home and are willing to keep rent the same and roll month to month if we decide to sign/renew a 6 month lease (December - May).

We by chance happened to see a listing for a new build for a home \~$985,000 which is to be finished by the end of the year which includes up to $40,000 in closing costs on the sellers end. Median single family homes here are \~1.1 million and condos \~520k.

Pre-approval for a loan was completed and the estimated rate is ""6.125% at 3.125 points"" after buying down w/ the remaining closing costs. Estimated monthly payments of $5,420 (Principal & Interest $4800, Hazard insurance $150, Real estate taxes $285, HOA $186).

Combined yearly income of \~225k (\~120k + \~105k). Planning to split 50 / 50 for everything.  
Combined \~$11,900 per month after taxes & 403b, but Person 1 only contributing 3% to 403b and Person 2 only contributing 5% to 403b (3% match for both of us).  
Combined $380k in HYSA, \~80k in roth IRA, \~100k in 403b.

Job security is stable. No current health issues. No student loans or debts aside from recurring monthly bills (phone, car insurance, roth IRA contributions, netflix, HBOmax, spotify, amazon prime). Planning to have children in \~2 years.

We are on the fence on committing and worried about ending up house poor in the future after having kids / as HOA fees rise / unsure if we are contributing enough to our 403b to be secure into retirement. We have heard about 0.28 DTI (pre-tax income?) and 50 / 30 / 20 rules (post-tax income?) but am not sure if there are other ways to gauge this situation and would really appreciate some advice or guidance. We have only gone to this one home and haven't checked out / given a chance to looking at other properties which feels silly for such a major life decision. It is likely we end up purchasing a used home/condo if we don't secure this place as there aren't any new developments nearby in the upcoming year. It's just more so that this offer to cover closing costs and it being the last model of it's release left puts the pressure on. This development plans to make a mix of condos/townhouses/homes over the next 9 years but there is no official word of which order/timing of releases.



TLDR;

$985,000 new build home w/ $40,000 closing costs covered on sellers send.  
Planned down payment of 20% (\~200k).   
Loan: ""6.125% at 3.125 points"" after buying down w/ remaining closing costs.  
Estimated monthly payments of $5,420 (principal/interest, hazard insurance, real estate taxes, HOA) before utilities.

Combined yearly income: \~225k  
Combined \~$11,900 per month after taxes & 403b, but Person 1 only contributing 3% to 403b and Person 2 only contributing 5% to 403b (3% match for both of us).  
Combined $380k in HYSA, \~80k in roth IRA (maxed yearly), \~100k in 403b (Person 1 invests 3%, Person 2 invests 5%).

No major debts / loans. Planning to have children in \~2 years. Worried about ending up house poor / costs of children in the future / if we're not currently contributing enough to retire safely and would really appreciate advice or guidance. Thank you so much.",1731860752.0

personalfinance,Camper/RV Loan Advice Needed,"Hi All,

  
I am currently looking to purchase a new 2025 Scout Olympic truck camper. I have a couple of options to purchase this camper, and we wanted to ask Reddit what would make the most sense. Here are a few details of my situation that may determine which route we should take.

  
Camper Cost: $34,000

Savings: $50,000 in 5% APY HYSA (Yields $208/mo - $2,500/yr)

Credit Score: 794

Debt: none besides mortgage all vehicles paid off no student loans.

Costs: $2,000/mo (utilities/mortgage/groceries/gas insurance etc.)

Income: $5,400/mo
  
1) Purchase in full.

2) Finance w/ BECU RV Loan @ a rate of 6.99%.

3) Make a substantial down payment and finance the balance.

  
I am not making any large purchases anytime soon besides possibly this camper. We do not have kids. We each make roughly $100,000/yr each, however this would be funded by just me. Resale value on these things would most likely be around $28,000-$30,000 if sold after 1-2yrs of using it (if we do not like the camper but I would expect to have this for years to come).

  
I've racked my brain, but wanted to get Reddit's thoughts on this.

personalfinance,"trying to rebuild after two injuries killed my career and my savings., and nearly killed me.  ","sorry, this is long. 

hey folks. I could use some help. I'm already beaten down into the dirt, if you could refrain from insulting me, I'd appreciate it.  I'm in pretty bad shape financially. doing my best to claw my way out of it. 

I'm 46. I started out as an art professor, but the pay ($32k in nyc), stress, and job stability was so bad that I moved into doing project management and 3D design for cabinetry, millwork, furniture, and interior design, mostly for high end flagship retail stores. Made about $85k/yr living in NYC. At the time, I was an active alcoholic with severe untreated lifetime depression, so I didn't manage my money well. **I'm now 7 years sober** and working with a good therapist, things are much better but my finances are worse, due to the fact that....

during the pandemic, after being laid off for a year by covid, I got severely injured riding a bicycle. Broke 8 bones, collapsed a lung, had a brain hemorrhage, had 3 surgeries, was on oxygen for 3 months, etc. Took a year to recover enough to go back to work. 

A year after that, I had a traumatic brain injury skiing. The TBI severely affected my vision and brain function, and I am no longer able to work as a project manager or designer, or many other things. I was out of work for almost two years and then initially could only work part time. A couple years later and after spending thousands and thousands of dollars (my entire savings), on treatment for the TBI that wasn't covered by insurance (meaning basically all of it), and after numerous false starts with trying to go back to my old career and various other jobs, I finally have a full time year round job that I can do, working as a maintenance manager for a Property Owners Association. 

fwiw, the brain injury makes decision making very difficult, especially when i'm stressed, which is why i'm here. 

so here's my current situation: 

* 46 yrs old. single, no kids, one small dog. $500 in savings, $1k emergency fund, no retirement, literally no family left except my mom who is 72 and has no savings or retirement besides the $600k house she inherited. 
* Live in a remote mountain town of 2k people. COL is somewhat expensive, but my AA sponsor is here, my therapist is here ($30 a session, basically pro bono), my job is here, all my sober friends are here, etc. I have to go to another town 30 minutes away about once a week for healthcare, groceries, walmart, etc. Moving somewhere cheaper would cost me several thousand and my pay would drop by half. I like it here and would prefer to live here permanently. 
* make $34/hr, about $70k a year, will get a stipend for health insurance, 3 weeks PTO, 10 holidays, IRA with 3% match. flexible schedule. I live 6 minutes from work. 
* starting a second job teaching skiing on weekends at $20/hr in a couple weeks. there is a chance that it will be too much with the TBI and I'll have to quit and focus on my main job. I also live about 5 minutes from this job. 
* Rent is $1250 a month for a 1bedroom during winter. In the summers, I live in a camper on a friends land and pay no rent. 
* groceries are about $400/month. I'm already mostly eating rice and beans, cheap eggs, cheap bulk frozen turkey burgers, and oatmeal, so it would be hard to get this cheaper. I maybe eat out once a month, usually at McDonalds using a deal on the app. 
* car insurance is $200/mo. I shopped around a lot and this is as low as I can get it. I've never had an accident, but I got three speeding tickets last year while visiting my mom on the east coast, just wasn't used to there being cops everywhere. This will get lower next year when my tickets fall off. 
* about $70/wk on gas.
* phone is Mint, it's $50/mo. 
* have a 2020 F150 that is financed. has 100k on it. I've paid about $17k on it so far, currently owe about $16k. 11% interest. payment is $435 a mo. I do need 4x4 and high clearance where I live as it snows a lot and they dont plow much, most of the roads are dirt/mud in summer, etc. I also do haul stuff several times a week for work. I'm trying to sell this but it's difficult because no one wants to deal with paying off the loan and waiting for the title, and I've mostly gotten lowball offers. I would ideally like to get rid of it and get a 90s truck I can work on myself (yes, I actually can, i used to be a mechanic). 
* I recently inherited a 2005 dodge diesel truck that doesn't run. It's prob worth about $15k running, but I need to put about $1k-$1500 into it to get it working again. I'm considering selling the ford and keeping this since I know the truck inside out and how to fix it, and i dont want to deal with someone else's used truck with god knows what problems, but also diesels are a pain and expensive. 
* have three maxed out credit cards due to being out of work and all the medical bills. I paid these off every month before I got injured but now it's out of control. 1 @ $6000, 1 @ $800, 1 @ $3500. 
* $90k in student loans at 6%. in deferment currently. 
* dont have anything else I can sell, except for a bunch of tools in storage that's worth maybe $3k, hesistant to sell these as they are potentially a source for additional income next summer, as I'm a skilled carpenter and those are in demand here at about $35/hr. Not something I can do full time, but part time for additional income is an option. 

Ideally, I'd like to get rid of all my debt and buy a small piece of land and build myself a small house so I never have to move again, but I realize that's a long way off. 

I think that's it. Greatly appreciate any help.

personalfinance,"44M, bad cancer diagnosis, need advice","Hey everyone,

Just found out that I am “extremely unlucky” and developed a “very aggressive” form of cancer that went undetected for too long (words of my doctor). Will start undergoing treatment soon and certainly hope for the best but there is a less-than-50% chance that I will live another 5 years.

Family: Married to 36F and we have a 1.5 year old son. She works and makes ~$120k/yr. His daycare and school will cost ~$25k/yr until he is out of middle school in ~13 years. Live in an ok neighborhood in a house we have fixed up to be comfortable over the past several years. $400k mortgage remaining at 2.99%, monthly mortgage payment of $2,500. I’m currently working and earning ~$300k/yr, I’m going to tell them about this situation tomorrow.

Investments: 
- $225k taxable brokerage account (index funds)
- $370k 401k
- $35k in each of our individual IRAs 
- $40k HSA
- $700k RSUs (big tech company I work for)
- $1k in 529 plan for son

Life insurance:
- $1.5mm in 20 year term life insurance I bought three years ago
- $900k from my work policy

Non-mortgage debts:
- $36k of student debt (mine) that will go away if I die
- No other debts. Cars and credit cards are paid off

Estate planning:
- going to have a lawyer draft a will that gives everything to my wife. I think this is how the law would operate anyway but better safe than sorry I guess. Will also allow for more sophisticated estate planning if necessary (trusts for the kid or something).

Just one main question for everyone: what can I do to make things easier financially on my wife and son if I die? Or even if I don’t die and end up requiring expensive treatment and might or might not be able to maintain employment? What should I be thinking of (other than the other obvious depressing stuff).

Here's the situation:

US citizen, early 60s, married and living with my Canadian wife as a PR for almost three years. Unable (unwanting) to work for a year until my PR status arrived, slowed by Covid. Mother died in 2022 leaving me about $350K US in an iIRA. Recent IRS rules give me a 10yr window to use the money. Now make over $200K CAD/yr at a corporate communications job so between the exchange rate and tax rate, I'm seeing a lot of this money potentially going away if I use it unwisely. My US advisor (basically my mother's former guy) who manages the iIRA is a little lost about what my Canadian status will have on the funds, so I find myself in a bit of a cross border quandry.

I had a healthy freelance video, design and film composition side business in the US and I'd love to use that money to transition from a corporate gig to a retirement gig that I thoroughly enjoy. Between my wife and I, we have enough but feel like a few more years of prudent earning/investing would position us for a comfortable post-9/5 life.

If I incorporated and built a studio (that could be sold as a studio or ADU) on our property, is there a way to move that money here and use it at a considerably lower rate? Are there other ways to save on taxes?

personalfinance,To Buy A Used Truck or To Not Buy?,"TLDR: I want to buy a vehicle before the end of year, is it the right move?

I currently drive a 2010 Nissan Altima with 250,000+ miles, I’ve had the car since high school (now 24) and have planned on driving it to 300,000. However, starting last year I’ve began having to put ~$3,000 a year in new parts into the vehicle to keep it running - this is getting costly for me.

I do not plan on selling the car as it’s paid off, I want to park it at my folks house (they’re willing to start/drive it when needed, air tires, routine maintenance, etc.) in Tennessee and over the next few years continue putting new parts into it. (I’m living Florida currently)

I don’t like and have never wanted to be in debt but the specific type of vehicle I want is a truck. I want a truck because it can be used as a tool for moving, will be safer, and I would be paying cheaper insurance than my current 2-door Altima. I would plan on doing all the regular routine maintenance on the truck as I have with my current car for it to last well over 200k. 

I would like to purchase a truck for ~$25,000 before the end of year as prices are the best for vehicles this time of year. Would this be a bad decision due to the major price point  or should I continue dumping the $3k annually into my car?

I’d like to pay $10,000 in cash and get a auto loan for the remaining $15,000. I have $0 in debt thankfully, $12,000 in a HYSA that I’ll use for the cash portion, $3,500 in savings, $1,000 in checking, $33,500 in a brokerage account (about $10,000 in cash at the moment), and $22,000 across my 401k and Roth IRA. I also currently make about $80,000 a year and have a 879 credit score.

Would I be making a bad decision to purchase a truck for $25,000? My rationale is the money I’m spending on my current car would just go into the trucks payment every year. I would also now have a truck I can use as a tool, safer vehicle, and larger for if/when I do have a family. I also have to drive somewhat regularly for work.

My ultimate goal in life is financial freedom and a purchase like this is hard for me to make, but I feel like it’s a justifiable decision if I’m planning on keeping the truck for 10+ years, and that I will be paying around the same or $100 more for the trucks payment and insurance versus the $320 monthly insurance payment I’m making on my 2010 Nissan Altima 2-door.

I thank you all in advance for any suggestions/advice in this situation.

personalfinance,Emergency fund recommendations ,"
Good morning all,

I am a federal worker with small kids who has recently come into some unexpected cash.  I'd like to park it somewhere safe as an emergency fund for the sole purpose of government shutdown(s).  My goal isn't to be political here, but not getting paid for about 45 days was pretty damned uncomfortable in 2019 and that was before I had kids.  I'm confident that I'd still have a job even if they decide to do what they've said in reducing the federal workforce by some crazy percentage because I have a job that needs to get done somehow or bad and newsworthy things happen quickly.  

If/when we shutdown again my goal isn't to remain comfortable, but pay the necessary bills to keep my lights on and food on the table as we belt tighten as this isn't exactly a windfall.  So it needs to be liquid enough to be accessible within a week or so, but while we're at it make some money with it.  

I am thinking a HYSA or just parking it in a bond fund within my existing brokerage account.  I'm totally open to other ideas and that's why I am here.

Yes, I know the need for emergency fund stuff, but due to other life circumstances those have been recently  depleted and have shown us the need for a change.

personalfinance,Considering filing for bankruptcy [Oregon],"Screenshot of my Finances -
https://imgur.com/gallery/b9pbCql
The IRS website is down until tomorrow which is why that is blank. There is at least $1k debt, probably much more. 

I just started a big girl job this week and get my first paycheck next friday, $28.50/hour. Not making a ton but it will be nice to have a consistent paycheck and benefits. However right now everything I make is going to monthly payments, this isn't counting groceries and expenses just to live. My credit score is already low. I already have a nice reliable car, the RAV4, so I won't need a car loan any time soon. I told my partner it sucks I wouldn't be able to buy a house for 7 years but he said ""with this debt would you even be able to anyways??"" Good point. I'll sell the Subaru as soon as I can afford to replace the windshield, get it detailed, and get a mechanic checkup, so that will help with my monthly output a lot.

I have questions regarding bankruptcy, pretty sure chapter 7 is what I want to go with:

- Will my IRS taxes be able to be filed? And will my state taxes be eligible now that they went to a collections agency?

- Can student loans go on there? I'm pretty sure they can't but I thought I'd ask

- I want to keep at least one credit card to pay off and then have for emergencies. And then build my credit back up by putting all my subscriptions on that card and paying it off every month. I was thinking of keeping the Fred Meyer credit card because it has the lowest debt and the lowest interest, however it has the lowest credit limit so if something seriously expensive happens I'm fucked. REI has the best benefits but the highest debt 🫣. The care credit has saved me with my very expensive and sensitive kitty 😩 so I'm unsure whether I should put that on or not, though that can only be used for medical stuff.

- PayPal credit will for sure go on, but a maybe slightly unethical question in regards to that. It's not maxed out, so if I plan to file bankruptcy anyways can I max it out paying my taxes or something else down and then file? I've been needing a laptop since my cat peed on mine last year, so I would finally get one.

- any other advice from those who are wiser than me. As you can see, I'm not very financially responsible or disciplined 🤦🏽‍♀️😩 though a lot of this debt came from not being able to work for 3-4 months after a serious concussion and my cat getting sick right in the middle of all of that, of course the pet insurance came after that. Then it came from being depressed from my concussion and coping by eating out and buying shit 🫣

personalfinance,HSA - Payroll Contribute vs After-Payroll Contribute; How much am I really losing out on?,"I have had a HealthEquity HSA for about 8 years now.  I put the max in each year, and I don't touch it.  It is invested (everything minus 2000 which is the max allowed) in a Target Date Fund (best option I had, don't let perfection be the enemy of the good, etc.).

I have been informed that the partnership in which I am a member\*, will be moving to ThrivePass starting this coming year (2025).  My understanding is everything I had in HealthEquity (8 years and 2 different employers) will remain there.  New contributions, if I elect to go through ""payroll"" deduct, will now go to ThrivePass.  The cost of ThrivePass is $1.10 per month.  (My understanding is HealthEquity has no fee).

My personal situation:

\- Single, no kids/dependents  
\- Make much higher than the SS ""wage base limit""

I've scoured this subreddit and the rest of the internet which seems to think that conventional wisdom says you should do the payroll deduct because you save on the FICA tax.  But if I'm contributing on an after-tax basis, I'm really only losing out on the 3.8% Medicare tax (1.45%+1.45%+0.9%) right?

So on $4300, I'd be losing out on $163.40?  (Minus the monthly fee puts me at $123.2.) But I cam recoup some of that by increasing my ""time in the market"" by contributing all $4300 for the year on 1/1/2025?

\*Extra Credit: For those of you who have already made it htis far and are willing to help me think through this, feel free to ignore this section if it makes things too complex and just answer the questions based on if I were a regular W2 employee.  I'm actually getting this HSA through a partnership in which I no longer have any active activities.  I get a K-1 at the end of the year, but no W2.  I'm guessing the FICA tax would possibly not even be applicable to me since they don't do any withholding, but I'm not 100% sure how that works.

Question 1: Should I maintain 2 HSAs (HealthEquity and ThrivePass), or consolidate into just one?  If so, which one?

Question 2: I'm tired of managing multiple accounts.  If the conclusion is that I'm losing out on much by doing after-tax contributions, is there any world in which it makes sense to transfer my HealthEquity to a brokerage, say Schwab, and contribute after-tax to Schwab from here on out, to consolidate my account to one brokerage (and in the case of Schwab, take advantage of the lower expense ratios)?

personalfinance,Need help with my refinance,"So I’m at the end of my refinancing process and banking company I’m working worth has been terrible at responding or giving me any real answers, I want to see if anyone relates to this or does this loan officer just sound like he doesn’t know what he’s doing ?

So back in September I started this process and was shopping around for the best interest rates and closing costs, because this is a no money out of pocket refinance, I’m using my equity I’ve gained in the first year and eight months of living here. 

I really am looking to get this done soon because my reasoning is for just a lower monthly payment and me and my fiancé just had our first baby and two months not worrying about the mortgage and a lower payment would be huge for us right now 

Anyways back in September I got quotes after they took into account the propertys value, my debt, and my income, from the mortgage companies at 5.25% FHA (my current rate is 7.25% FHA) 


Now with this banking company they claimed to match other companies offers apples to apples. He said and I have it on email they can match the 5.25% FHA or offer a 5.65% Conventional. I decided to work with the banking company and take the 5.65% Conventional. And off course he said they can match it after he ran his number about the property value, my debt, and my income.

Keep in mind I have a 1st and 2nd mortgage 
I have 295,752$ left on the 1st 
I have 9,598$ left on the 2nd
I wanted to combine the two to save on interest 

Now keep in mind now that my appraisal came in at 335,000$

There’s some room here but no enough to combine them together 

95% LTV of 335,000$ is 318,250$
The new loan amount would be 322,593$ 
Which means I would need to come out of pocket 4,343$

Now the frustrating part is that I wasted all this time for his false promise “locking me in at 5.65%” when at the start of all this we already had these numbers and he dragged me along through this to say “5.65% is still possible if you want to purchase points” 

No way! That means 1.5% is possible too right! I just need to probably drop 50 grand to buy my way down there 🤣🤣

Anyway we’re half way through November and he still hasn’t given me a rate when he has all the numbers! Funny part too he only responds to my questions on Fridays at 4pm. 

I already did his job and did the math if I remove the 2nd Lein which at this point I’m going to have to do given the situation I’m in. It’ll leave me at 93.4% LTV under the 95% LTV cap. 

Call me out on this if I’m stupid or not. This is a house we don’t see ourselves in after maybe 10 years. But we’d love to keep this house to rent it out to someone we can trust. Should I do FHA loan and refinance theoretically when rates go down and my property value goes up? 

Because I live in a housing market where prices are just tending to raise constantly every year and we’re  up 30,000$ in our first year and half of ownership 

Or should I go with conventional and after 10 years have that PMI knocked off automatically? 

Super hard decision to make but regardless I had my 7.25% rate and a 5% would definitely help our situation right now.

Mind you everytime I try to contact them i never get an answer on payment plans or anything.

personalfinance,Home equity loan; own house out right.,"Hello All,

I am looking to come up with about $60k for home renovations. I currently own my house without a mortgage and it was appraised for $600k.

I am dabbling with the idea of a home equity loan, but rates are still a bit uncomfortable for me (Navy Fed quoted me at 9%). I tried to make the argument that they are virtually assuming zero risk as my house does not have a mortgage, but they were unwilling to budge on the rates.

Does anyone have any recommendations on where to shop around or other options to leverage the equity in my house?",1731812714.0
personalfinance,Debt Consolidation (Possibly HEL/HELOC),"I am looking for advice on consolidating debt and lowering average interest rate. I am married and our annual household income is about $110,000. Our mortgage company estimates our house at just over $400,000 and we currently owe around $235,500. The existing debt consolidation loan was used to pay off various medical debt. Credit Card 1 has been caring a balance for several years from overspending when I was younger and a few unplanned expensive, have already paid off over $4,000 on it this year. I plan on blocking Credit Card 1 and shredding it after it is paid off (I don't want to hurt my credit by canceling it). Credit Card 2's balance is from the last year or so primarily from a trip to visit family across the country (after paying it off I would block it and lock it in our document safe). The Care Credit has been used for various medical, and vet bills the last year and a half totaling aprox $4,000 that has all been paid off. I know addressing the reason for debt is always the first step which I feel we have done, and now I am just trying to consolidate and hopefully address the high interest accounts.

Debt:

Mortgage: $1,750/month at 3.625%

Credit Card 1:  Aprox $7,500 at 24.15%

Credit Card 2: Aprox $7,000 at 18%

Care Credit Card: $0

Debt Consolidation Personal Loan: $16,000 at 27.48%

Camper Trailer Loan: $24,000 at 7.0%

Mattress Firm Loan: $1,726 at 29.99%

Auto Loan: Aprox $40,700 at 7.94%

Monthly Bills (Insurance, Fuels, Utilities, etc.): Aprox $1,060

For just additional information both of our Credit Scores are in the 680-720 range.

Edit 1: I appreciate the many responses. I would say that I feel some of the advice was given after only half reading my post. I have no worries about paying off the current debt as we have already paid off over $4k of the debt this year. I also stated the current consolidation was  to pay off medical bills. Plus a large portion of the debt is from a few years ago when our income was in the $60-70k range and had lower credits hence the high rates. My goal with this was to possibly have a lower average intrest rate and overall pay less intrest.

Edit 2: Just want to summarize we have the abve debt and income. We have no issues making payments, I am just looking at options to pay less interest overall. We have a budget with not many items that aren't bills ( 1 streaming service and a gym membership) and am not looking to sell any items.",1731812659.0

personalfinance,Credit score questions,"Hi! 

I currently have a 738 as a 25 year old male. Some mismanagement a while back dropped me down but I have recovered and am ahead now, but want to increase this number so I have some ideas. 

My only debt now is my motorcycle. 

I have a motorcycle payment, but is 2.9% so I really don't care to pay it off early although I could afford to pay it today. It's good to have this auto payment every month right? What I spend in interest I gain in credit? 

I want to buy another motorcycle, although much cheaper than the last(this is my hobby) and would pay cash. Unless. Does it make more sense to pay off the other one and then apply for a new loan for a different motorcycle? 

I also want to open a new CC (amex platinum) that would have a spending requirement to earn the bonus points. Do I put motorcycle on the card and pay card balance then to earn bonus points? The only way I think this would work is cash advancing the money because purchase would be private party. Then just paying the balance at the end of the month? Or stretch it out maybe 3 months?

personalfinance,Paying ahead on car loan questions,"Okay so I have a car loan through Wells Fargo Auto. A few months ago I decided to start putting extra money towards the loan to pay it off faster. According to Wells Fargo, the policy states - “extra payments will go towards next month’s balance, once you are 3 months ahead the due date will stop advancing, and any payments will then go towards principle only.” So that’s where I’m at now. My due date is in February but I still plan on making monthly payments in order to pay the loan off faster. I just made my monthly payment today, and it all went towards principal. But my question is, what happens to all the interest in the meantime? Since I didn’t pay any interest this month, is it going to be accruing for three months until February? And then I’ll have just a bunch of interest due? If I keep paying ahead, will I just pay a bunch of interest all at once at the end of the loan? I know principal only payments will reduce overall interest paid, but I just don’t understand what’s happening to the interest now while I’m making these principal only payments. Sorry if this is obvious I’m just barely learning how all this stuff works. Thanks. ",1731809710.0

But the new job doesn't have an option for a 401k for 1 year, so I made some changes to my budget.  Currently living with my girlfriend and looking to buy a house in roughly 2 years.  Have 56k saved up between Roth IRA and 401k and 60k saved in a brokerage account.  Current emergency fund has $1,800 and my monthly costs are  $4500.  Would it be better to aggressively allocate towards the emergency fund rather than brokerage?

I totaled my car earlier this year and decided to buy a new car (37k) and drive it to the ground.  I've got 8k left on that, so about a year left of car payments.

Income: 2000pm, mortgage 950, interest rate: 3%

2nd rental: 195000 debt, value 375000

3rd: primary residence: 320000 debt, 55000 debt from construction. Value 600000 
Mortgage 2500 potential rent: 2800 interest rate 5.5% 

Option 1. Sell my primary residence net about 180,000 after fees, use the 180000 and buy a new property. This seems like the best option but looking at property taxes and mortgage rates in the new city I’d be expecting to pay about 3500 a month depending on what range of housing go for. Keep the other properties and continue to rent out

Option 2: sell all properties, this should net about 475000 when all is said and done. Use this to buy a primary residence and have 0 mortgage

Option 3. Rent out all my properties and rent a house in the new city. Spend a year is so till all the construction debt is payed off before I buy a primary residence. Hopefully interest rates have come down and I’ll know the new city a little better. 

Option 3B. My current primary residence is in a great location and Airbnb would be an option. I could take a risk and see how this goes for 6 months to see if it works.  

The new city is also relatively close to my properties, about 3 hours drive. I could still do most of the maintenance and outsource any emergencies if and when they pop up.

The parent is 70 years old, currently taking social security

Income: \~1000/month from SSA after Medicare is taken out

Checking+bank savings: \~$6000

Investments: $9000 in a Vanguard Roth IRA with a 2025 target date (years ago they put a 3000 in because I hounded them too)

Assets: 10-acre homestead (I am guessing it is worth over 120K) that is rented out for 700/month - basically it pays for its taxes, insurance and a little for upkeep, but not a money maker. The caretaker pays a reduced rent for mostly keeping the place up. One day I imagine my parent will sell it to pay for end-of-life care but hasn't parted with it yet. Also they have a car that is long in the tooth but all paid for.

Fortunately, they are good about living with in a budget and do not have a credit card.

Expenses:

Housing, utilities, food are covered because they live with me and my kids. They help with childcare and picking up kids from school and occasionally covers the groceries and gas for the cars.

So far medical expenses have been small (post cancer) and only has 2 prescriptions

They have no debt, but cancer wiped out their life savings 5 years ago. Survived but can no longer work a job. My understanding is that disability was not an option because they screwed up with paying social security while self-employed before cancer (something about not having enough quarters paid recently and back paying social security didn't make sense I guess).

Has a term life insurance policy that will end in 2032 and costs \~2,000 year

What are their options? What should I be thinking about as basically their ""retirement plan""

**Update:**  
I get ditching the term insurance, I think they thought that it would be helpful to me and my family  
What do I have to worry about regarding medical debts at the end? My understanding is that it does not transfer to the offspring.

1. I am looking to Elder Care resources for Ohio and will try to talk to an elder care specialist.
2. Term Life insurance:  He got it before getting cancer. My dad wants me to have the money from the term life insurance to help with the kids, especially for my special needs kiddo (he wishes he could have given us more).     I will see if I can help pick up some of the premium or try to invest that same amount of money for him.

I think he did not expect to live this long especially after cancer and still thinks he will die before it is over.
3. His homestead: He also doesn't want his land to be developed. It is good farmland that has not been sprayed with pesticides in over 25 years. He wants to keep in food production for the local foodshed. The actual farmhouse is basic (1200 sqft with no AC, Solar powered, propane heaters and refrigeration).

personalfinance,Thoughts on leasing vehicles as a luxury expense,"I’d love some thoughts on this - to clarify, I’m not looking for anyone to confirm my thinking or talk me out of it, I’m just curious how others would approach this.

My business has done fantastically well in recent years, with my income going from under $30k in 2019 to well over six figures this year and the last few years. I have been cautious to not inflate my lifestyle but at this point I want to spend some of that money on things that I want.

I got my finances together partially by listening to Dave Ramsey, and he is against any way of using a vehicle that does not involve buying it in cash. I think this is great advice for people struggling with money, or if you look at it from a purely practical standpoint.

The big caveat is that I am looking at this as a luxury expense, not a practical expense. I don’t “need” a nicer car but I want one lol and I can easily afford it. Practical advice would say that’s fine, but pay cash. 

My pushback is that I want a new vehicle every few years, and I don’t view vehicles as an asset because their value goes down so quickly and drastically in most cases. I got burned by buying a $30k used car at the peak of Covid-era used car inflation that is now worth under $15k.

All that is to say, I’m failing to see the downside to leasing a vehicle under the following assumptions:

1. I have no other debt
2. I am saving and/or investing 25% of my income
3. I have enough cash reserves to pay off the lease and buy a used car cash in a worst-case scenario
4. I understand that this is purely a luxury purchase and the money spent is never coming back to me
5. I don’t plan on keeping the vehicle for more than three years

I would like to give my parents $2k because they have helped me with a lot of bills during this time. That will leave me with about $40k. What should I do with the rest?

personalfinance,All personal financial information compromised - what should I do?,"Hello! This is sort of an IT/personal finance question, but I thought I'd ask it here since you all probably know a lot about protecting your money or may have been in a similar situation. I will probably crosspost to other subreddits.

My place of work was recently the target of a cyber attack. In response, my employer shut down the internet and access to other utilities while they figured it out. When this first happened, they told us they had acted quickly and our personal data was likely not in danger. However, it has been three weeks, they have given us zero information about what is happening, and I am growing increasingly dubious of their ability to protect my financial information.

Here is the information my employer has that could be potentially compromised:

* All personal information (full name, date of birth, social, address, etc.)

*Checking account 

*Retirement accounts (403b and pension)

*Health insurance accounts

*Life insurance


I froze my credit through the major three bureaus, and am in the process of freezing my bank account, but I don't know where to go from here. Even if I freeze my accounts, wouldn't it be easy for hackers to bypass those freezes with everything they could have gained from a breach?

personalfinance,What is the smartest way for me to go about securing a home for parents?,"I'm planning to secure a home for my parents-in-law so that they can live near us which will be a good psychological benefit to them and to my spouse, and will also simplify our lives in terms of childcare in a pinch or caring for them as they age.  I'm trying to think about what makes the most sense for how to actually do this.

Their situation is such that I think they will have trouble securing the mortgage without help.  At their current income, they could probably get the mortgage they need and have a reasonable downpayment for a first-time homebuyer when they sell everything in the old location.  But they will be moving cross-country and needing to find new jobs here.  One of them will be able to get hired immediately given his particular job skills, but the other probably will not get hired right away.  Getting hired late career is no easy feat if you don't have high-demand skills where the employer can't be picky.

Anyway, I'm financially in a position that I can buy this second home without jeopardizing my own finances.  I'm curious if anyone has any ideas or resources that might be useful for understanding this situation better.  Given that they are maybe 10 years from retirement, I'm even trying to consider what makes sense from an estate planning perspective or the asset testing that goes into end of life/nursing home care.

The trust level here is high and financially, I'm comfortable with carrying the house on my books or just helping them get the house onto theirs, but I would not be in a position to just pay cash and let them live there.  If we do this, I'd probably get a mortgage on the place and then figure out the way that makes the most sense for them to contribute to the carrying costs of the house.  I don't need to make money on the house each month, I just would prefer not to treat it as a full blown gift.

The options I'm considering:

* Co-sign their mortgage, they get a mortgage in their name and they own the home

* I buy it with the plan of eventually having them assume the mortgage

* Setting it up as a lease to own where I carry the house with a plan for them to end up owning it via the lease payments

* Buy the house and treat it like an investment property and them like a tenant with no plan for them to ever own the home

Does anyone have any thoughts about how to navigate this situation on the finances?  For the purpose of this discussion, I'd prefer not to hear advice about why I should or shouldn't help them.  That is a lifestyle decision that's already made and now it's just about being smart on the best financial path to achieve it in the areas of minimizing interest costs, maximizing tax benefits, etc.

personalfinance,I paid off my student loans and my credit score actually went up. Is this weird?,"I recently paid off my student loans (about $43k total) thanks to a very generous gift from a family member. I was preparing for my credit score to plummet once the account closures hit, but according to Credit Karma, it's actually gone up?

It's only been about a month since the payment went through, but my TransUnion jumped from 754 to 769, and Equifax from 754 to 775. There had been little change in my scores for many months prior, and nothing else has changed for me finance-wise, so it was most definitely this.

What I am trying to determine is if this is a fluke, and I should still expect to be hit hard in the near future, or did I somehow accidentally cheat the system? These were my oldest accounts (some over a decade old), and the only other accounts I have are from within the last 5 years. 

These include a couple of credit cards that I regularly pay off, and a car loan that's currently at a little under $20k. I do choose to break up my car payments into twice a month, which I have found to be beneficial for bumping up credit scores in the past, but I'm not sure if that would even be relevant now.

That somehow my account had been accessed and totally drained, along with 3 other employees’.
The 401k accounts are managed by Merrill aka Merrill Lynch. It’s some sort of small business 401k group plan consisting of 3 to 5 separate 401ks.

My former boss told me that my money would be returned to my account, but that I would have to wait “fifteen days”.

My former boss told me this on October 28, 2024.

It’s now November 15, 2024, and I still am not able to access my account and Merrill still claims that I don’t have an account. 

I have done a lot of internet searching trying to find any Merrill policy involving “fifteen days” to no avail.

The only thing I have found is a policy someone mentioned on Reddit pertaining to rollovers. Apparently, retirement plan administrators must make retirement plan accounts accessible by the fifteenth day of the following month once a rollover has been requested/initiated.

My former boss has stopped taking my calls, which is disconcerting to say the least, so I am not getting any more information from him.

When I call Merrill customer service, every person in every department tells me that there is no record of my account, even though I was logging on to Benefits Online prior to October 28 and viewing my account just fine.

Please comment if you have any feedback or advice!

I just talked to my former boss and he is now claiming that I “never had a 401k” and asked me to “stop bothering him”. 😳🤬

personalfinance,Dual citizenship (American German) and tax/inheritance consequences,"TL;DR - how can I ensure that dual citizenship doesn’t negatively impact my tax and possible inheritance situation?

_______

I recently learned that I am, technically speaking, a German dual citizen by descent. 

Long story short, under German law if you are descended from a German citizen, under certain circumstances (especially if by paternal heritage) you may be have been born a German citizen without even having known it, and are eligible for a German passport with only a few bureaucratic hoops to jump through, which is my situation. 

While I’d love to have the benefits of dual citizenship, my biggest questions of course have been around tax consequences. I need to find a tax specialist that is well versed in understanding the consequences of having American/German dual citizenship, particularly around inheritance issues. Both my parents and my spouse’s parents were very fortunate in life, and as I understand it both of us can expect some kind of inheritance when our parents pass. My spouse has no claim on dual citizenship and is purely American. Both of us are considered fairly high income by American (and German) standards with incomes over $120k, with significant room to grow in the future. 

I did speak to a German immigration lawyer, who said my case was effectively a slam dunk for dual citizenship and “in 99% of cases would not effect taxes due to treaties” but recommended I speak to a specialist to confirm. Of course, I’d like to ensure I don’t fall into that 1% of cases where it has negative financial consequences. 

What would be the best path forward in finding someone that can speak to this situation with authority? I don’t want to leave this to purely internet research, and it seems challenging to find someone with good knowledge on this particular subject from both a German/EU standpoint and American one (I live in the US and up until this point have been purely a US citizen).

personalfinance,Buying land with a loan and building a home with my own cash.  Do I need homeowners insurance?,"Greetings,

I live in Florida where home owners insurance is extremely expensive and so is the hosing market in general.  Fingers crossed for the market to come down in 2025...

I will soon be in the market for a home and am interested in buying a more rural area of south Florida.  
I am considering Agricultural land because I like farming and gardening etc.  

One scenario Im thinking about that I'd like clarity on in regards to Home Owner insurance.

Scenario  
\- Purchase an Agricultural land with a USDA loan.  
\- Build a house on this land with my own money.  
Since I built a house on land that is financed, will that mortgage require home owner insurance even though the house is fully paid for???

personalfinance,401k + Simple IRA rollover within the same year?,"I have a question about rollover limitations.

personalfinance,Finance a Newer Car or Cash for Older Car,"Hi,

I am looking at getting my first car! I am looking to get a Prius to save on expensive California gas prices. Here are the two options I am considering:

1) Buy an older used car 2009-2013, 130k-180k miles, $6-11k (Pay in cash)

2) Finance a newer used car 2018-2022, 40k-100k miles, $19-23k (Finance  \~7.5%)

  
Alright here is where it gets a little more interesting. If I were to finance a new car I would also look to get a Prius Prime (plug in model). This Prius qualifies for the 4k [used EV tax credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit).  This credit would essentially cover dealer fees and interest payments (assuming a 7.5% APR on $17\~20k, 48 month loan) So in essence I would be taking a 0% APR loan. As someone who likes to invest my money the opportunity cost here seems very enticing. I would be looking to put down like 5K just to bring the total loan amount down.

  
So here are the pros and cons of each option:

1) Buy older used car with cash

Pros:

* No car payments (extra point for mental health lol)
* Cheaper
* Cheaper registration fees
* Cheaper insurance

Cons:

* Higher maintenance costs (not sure how to attach a dollar amount to this, plz help!)
* Lower resale value

  
2) Finance a newer used car

Pros:

* 4k tax credit
* My work has free EV charging
* Less maintenance
* Having a newer car is nice lol
* Car loan is good long term for credit score

Cons:

* More expensive
* Higher registration fees
* Higher insurance costs

  
TLDR: Should I buy a cheaper older car for cash or finance a newer used car at 0% APR b/c of a tax credit.

personalfinance,24 and trying to figure out my life after getting a new job,"After all the benefit deductions and taxes, it works out to about $4180/month, or 50,256/year. Pre-everything, closer to $70k. My previous job was netting closer to $40k, so I'd prefer to avoid the ""wow I feel rich"" effect. 

I have $40k in savings from working all through uni and $26k in student loans. Although they're in special forbearance until Feb, I'm planning to throw a minimum of $200 per paycheck at them. If nothing major happens, might start tossing extra in from savings once payments resume but idk if it's a good plan. 

My rent is $1100/month and includes utilities and parking. No car loan, but I pay an average of $20/week for gas. Insurance is $150/month bc I live in the DMV area and we can't drive lmao.

My groceries are $60-70/week and are largely produce, tofu, and snacks. The go-to is hmart or a local chinese grocer (and that's non-negotiable). District I've recently moved to has a lot of quality takeout. On average, it costs $15 if you're buying a vegetarian dish, plus $6-7 if you want boba. A big sticking point for my discretionary budget is how often I can dine out. Rn, I dine out weekly bc my friends and I do bar trivia.

My subscriptions are crunchyroll, spotify, the disney/hulu/espn bundle, amazon prime, viz app, shonen jump, lingodeer/cake. Crunchyroll may get dropped bc new anime isn't interesting anymore.

I'm also eyeing some mandarin and korean 101 classes for winter. They're going to be group ones for the social aspect. Still waiting on the schedules but I've been quoted $240 for the korean class and $375 for the mandarin class. Both are useful in my region and I don't really have a preference, so it'll come down to scheduling issues prob. I work a 9-5, have a social life, and dabble in game dev, so I can only realistically handle one.

My main vices are $70 video games and celebrating big professional achievements with kpop and anime merch. Tbh I often buy games I want on day 1. But even though I play gacha games like Star Rail, I prefer physical merch and never buy in-app purchases. Anyways, my office may have about $100 in blind-box figurines rn.

Today, I see that he traded positions in that exact account YESTERDAY, the day we talked! No mention on the phone, no asking me if I want that! In the past, he ALWAYS confirmed with me!

Given that I asked to move positions into unmanaged account should be obvious indication alone that I would NOT AGREE with selling/buying of stuff by him.

On top, he bought some stocks that I was planning to sell at a loss. Now I cannot do that or it would be a wash sale (for 30 days).

personalfinance,Please guide me around HELOC as I need some cash for the next 6 months ,"
Hi everyone,  

As the title suggests, I’m seeking guidance on HELOCs.  

My wife and I both have stable incomes. However, due to recent changes in our household finances (buying a house, daycare costs for our baby, car expenses, insurance, etc.), I anticipate being short on daycare fees—approximately $2,000 per month—in about three months. For now, I’ve set some money aside to cover this gap.  

I’m actively job hunting for a better-paying position, but there’s no guarantee of when I’ll secure one. My next pay raise, scheduled in six months, will only be a 6% increase, which won’t be sufficient to address the shortfall.  

Recently, I was contacted by BoF about the option of a HELOC. This got me thinking that it could serve as a financial cushion if I’m unable to find a higher-paying job within the necessary timeframe.  

I’d appreciate any advice or insights on whether a HELOC might be a good option in this situation.

I just didn't realize I have lost that much, and the fact that if I had invested them in index funds I could even be up double that . Those thoughts and the fact that I only have $50k in savings at this age crushes me. 
I graduated from a top 10 college, all my college friends are now multi millionaires and am at this sorry state.

My wife has $600k saved and we are were planning to buy an house next year with $300k down. We split the finance 50:50, so I would have to put down $150k.

I am working because I love my job but it’s incredibly painful, and I’m getting through the day with pain meds.  My husband and I want to have kids and my doctor recommended I take a leave of absence from work for my whole pregnancy.  I do have disability insurance so as long as my doctor signs off on it I can still get close to my monthly salary while on disability, but being new to my job, my union rep said I can really only be out from about month 5ish to 3 months post pregnancy.  Ok so with all that background info:

- settlement will be $165k.
- we are currently buying a house with a $525k loan and 6.5% interest rate.
- monthly mortgage payment is about $4500 and my husband and I take home $11k a month after retirement, insurance, ect
- we have no other debt, but our cars are a 2010 ford truck and a 2015 Mitsubishi lancer
- my husband will also receive a settlement for having to care for me through multiple surgeries
- we have health insurance that has a policy they will not assert a lien on our settlement

Since I will be able to collect disability, does it make sense to just keep paying the house and invest the whole settlement?  Make investments in the house (like use maybe $50k towards the house and invest the other $100k, and use $15k for other life things).  So we put the whole thing towards the house to refinance the monthly payment down, or possibly try to switch to a 15 year mortgage vs 30?

Let me get straight to the point here. I recently received an email from email address citicards@info6.citi.com stating “Hi, OP. Welcome to your new Citi Strata PremierSM Card, with a $13,000.00 credit limit. Your account is considered open as of, November 14, 2024.”……okay I’ve never applied for a Citibank card ever..

The next email states “OP has successfully registered with Citi Online. Now it's easy to take advantage of all the great benefits of Citi Online, like paperless management, alerts, online bill pay and more.” This was from citicards@info6.citi.com….again I never applied for a card.

The last email of that day stated “Hi, OP. As requested, the security questions used to help verify your identity in the Citi Mobile® App or Citi® Online have been changed” and this was from citi@info6.citi.com. 

This was all yesterday, I didint call a number on any of those email but rather the fraud department straight from the website 1-800-950-5114 and all the representatives have a deep accent. They tried to ask me for the answer of the security question to access the account for me and I told them I don’t have an answer because I never created an account with them. The fraud department stated “okay we closed the card and this won’t affect your credit. The account is being forwarded to our investigation unit” ect ect 

Lord behold today 2 emails… one from transunion stating that CBNA pull a hard inquiry on my credit report. I froze all 3 of my account’s immediately , last email was from citi stating “your new card is shipped!” Like okay didint they say it was closed yesterday?

I do have a Citi buisness travel card since I am in the armed forces for work. That card was provided to me. I looked into that account and nothing there reflects what was said in the emails. I called the number on the back of that card and they stated that they don’t work with the personal credit cards section of Citibank and redirected me to the number I called initially. 

I called again and the lady told me again “okay op we cancelled the card” I asked if I can get an email stating that and she told me “no we will mail you a letter”…or we will give you a call. Like common I am currently overseas aswell. I don’t have access to any of that. 

I am extremely worried because I fear identity theft overall and this situation is making me sick to my stomach. ",1731704816.0
personalfinance,Mid 20’s traditional vs Roth 403b and what to do with leftover money? ,"I am a 26-year-old nurse and have been working for a year and a half.

I’d love to hear what you’d do in my situation. Here’s a bit of context:

* **Location**: Los Angeles County
* Age: 30 and 29
* **Household Income**: $280k (DINK)
* **Current Situation**: My husband and I bought a house last year with a 5% down payment and a 5.75% interest rate. The house has an ADU, so we’ve been house-hacking by living in the ADU and renting out the main house. Our tenant covers about 70% of the mortgage, and we’re paying less than we did for rent in the past.

Now, we’re ready to move to a bigger home in a better neighborhood and have a kid. This time, we won’t be house-hacking and plan to rent out the ADU at our current property for extra income.

* **Savings**: We have 20% saved for a down payment on the next home.
* **Questions**:
   1. Would it be better to do another 5% down payment instead of 20%, and invest the rest in index?
   2. Should we consider renting instead of buying and invest the difference between rent and mortgage payments?
   3. Should we wait for the housing market to cool down?

Here's the situation:

* Income: 160-180k per year
* Retirement Savings:
* Maxed out 401k with a 5% match
* Pension that will pay ~4.5k/month
* Government pension ~500/month
* Estimated Social Security: 2k/month
* Currently have ~1.4 million in retirement accounts
* Other Savings: Maxing out HSA
* Expenses: Living with parents, no debt (no car, house, student loans)
* Location: Midwest, medium-high cost of living

The Dilemma:

I'm itching to move out, buy a house (around 500k), and get a new car (around 60k).  Ideally, I'd like to relocate and eventually get married, but honestly, I feel stuck.  I'm unhappy living with my parents, but I'm hesitant to make changes that could significantly impact my early retirement plans.

My Questions:

Am I sacrificing too much of my present for the future?
Should I loosen the reins on my savings and start living a little more?

personalfinance,Shorter or longer term HELOC if not planning on staying in house,"So long story short, my spouse and I were rather reckless with credit card usage between life/wedding/hospital expenses and we're in the hole pretty badly. To about the tune of $70,000 or so. 

As a last ditch effort to relieve some of the crushing interest (only on 1 income) my idea is to take out a fixed rate HELOC on the house (which has a mortgage about halfway paid down). This will allow me to get everything financially back on track at a much lower rate, SHRED and cancel all but 1 credit card, and actually have spare money at the end of the month to save/pay down extra/vacation/etc. The options are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years. Adding to this, we are not planning on staying in this house since it's very much a starter home in size, ideally within the next 2-3 years we want to sell and find a new one to move into to raise a family. 

So that being said, which length should I do for the HELOC? Generally I know the shorter term is better, you pay less interest overall even if the amount per month is higher. However, given that we are planning on selling in the near future, would it be better instead to do a longer term like 30 years for lower monthly payments now? Either way the remaining mortgage and heloc get paid off once a sale goes through, and I could use extra money in my pocket each month now vs realizing a bit more back later on when a sale goes through. 

Any opinions? Not really looking for other alternative financing options, just which length would be better to do. Thanks. ",1731751371.0

He's insisting that I get the discover card, a Chime card, and take out a secure loan from ESL. He says that Self is a prepaid loan which checks out, but I still am upset he did all of this without asking me.* ***To clarify: he did not actually sign me up for four. That's what I thought he did. He signed me up for 2 things without asking: Discover and Self. His plan is to get me a discover student credit card, continue using Self for a loan which you get the money back for, open a Chime card for me, and take out a loan to be paid over 6 months at ESL.*** *He says Chime is 0 risk, that he'll pay the difference for the ESL loan, and Self will give the money back in 2026 as 1,000 dollars. The only risky thing I see is Discover, however if i link that to my own bank account (see below), I think I should be ok. I declined the application which is good, so that if i change my mind, i can log in with my own info... but if hes already made an account and everything, idk... I feel that many people here are overreacting a bit, but I do agree with some of the sentiments. I know my dad and know that he can be pushy, so I'm setting boundaries. I can tell that he really does want to help, but I'm worried he's not going to be able to make some of the payments (like for Self) thanks to his poor financial circumstances.*

I know it's important to build credit, but waking up on my birthday to an email saying my application for a Discover student credit card was received was not what I was expecting. He also signed me up for Self (no idea what that is), and is demanding that I sign up for Chime and another credit card for my personal bank account I use for work.

Here's the other thing--I have a bank of America account, and he's using it for his own work deposits/withdraws. It's essentially an account in my name that he's using. We made it when I was 17, so I guess he legally has access, but I'm worried about having someone else's paychecks and what have you in an account under MY name.

My father does not have a good credit score and has gone bankrupt multiple times. Apparently he knows what to do though, because he's ""taken multiple classes,"" and to be truthful, I do believe he helped improve my stepmom's credit score immensely.

I'm not sure what to do... I canceled the Discover student credit card application, I have no idea what Self is so I'll have to look into that, and tomorrow he's gung ho on getting me signed up for Chime and a credit card with my other bank account that he does not have access to (at least for now...). For now the only credit card I want is with my own bank account. I know people get more as time goes on, but 4 at once seems like overkill, and I don't want him in control of that.

I'm afraid that he's using my own name/bank account/cards for his own personal use because he can't due to financial instability. I don't expect him doing bad with the cards, but also, I don't really want to have 4, and I don't want him touching my stuff, and I want to do things myself, and for the love of God I do not want anyone signing me up for things without my knowledge in MY name!!!",1731731989.0

personalfinance,Selling assets at a loss to cover backtaxes,"Hello all,

*automoderator made me take out $ amounts and other helpful details,  but let me ask my question anyway!*

  ------

I have been confused about this for some time. I traded in and out of crypto at a gain from 2019-2022. I got wise to taxes and logged my transactions to pay backtaxes for that bull run in 2023. 

I sold at a significant loss to cover the backtaxes. My tax guy didn't take this loss into consideration and I didn't know any better, so I sold and wrote a check which amounted basically to my entire balance given the lower asset value.

 It was pretty traumatizing and I wrote the check after minimal research. I also don't know enough to tell if my tax guy did a bad job or a great job. My only other second opinions were coinly and HR block which aren't really the sharps either.

  I'm wondering, now that I'm feeling more grounded.... is there some way I can claim a loss or something to regain some of my cash losses, or file an amendment? Is there any way or hope that an amendment could gain me some sort of a refund from the IRS and my state DOR? I sold at the end of 2023.

  Can you all give me some advice on selling at a huge discount compared to where my taxes were being calculated? I really don't understand this stuff and I think my tax guy could have helped me more. Any help is appreciated a lot.

Another detail i can think of that will probably get past the automod is that there were two significant sales I made in 2021 that accounted for most of my tax burden, both were sales at the ""top"" and accrued short term gains, taxed at 35%. My assets were worth about 48% of this ""top"" when I sold to cover the burden. Thanks again for any help, I have also sent out emails to a couple tax pros",1731725353.0

The large premium difference and potential deductible/oopm costs seem like they would eat into potential tax savings but I haven't found a calculator that takes all factors into consideration.

If we stick with HMO, we would invest the money we would of spent on HSA/HDHP (premium, deductible, contribution) in a pre-tax 403b.

personalfinance,Looking for guidance with debt so I can move and go back to school,"23F I'm looking for guidance in how to bring my debts down while also getting the money for two financial hurdles I'm facing:  **1.** I need to move in a fairly competitive market where my credit score is really important and **2.** I want to pay off a school debt so I can go back to school, finish my degree, and get a better paying job in my field (healthcare management).

I have approx $3600 (26.74% APR) on a Chase credit card, $2600 (18% APR) on a Navy Federal card, and $575 (17.35% APR) owed on a personal loan.

The school debt is $9000 and I currently have a payment plan to pay $150 monthly over 60 months and it does not count towards my credit. Until the debt is paid in full, however, there's a hold on my account and I can't enroll at any public college or university in my state or get an official transcript sent to another institution.

I work full time and bring home approx $2600 monthly after taxes, the overwhelming majority of which goes to paying my rent+utilities of $1640, which I'm aware is way out of living within my means. I then pay \~$124 monthly towards the loan (usually more when I can) and approx $400 cumulatively towards my credit card balances.

My main goal in the moment to move in with roommates and thus reduce housing expenses, but that does require decent credit for apartment applications (>680) which is the norm where I live and work, and the money to move in the first place. The school piece is more of a longer term goal atp, but I still want to keep it in mind.

*The options I'm considering:*

My first thought was to take out a personal loan with my credit union where I currently have a loan and consolidate all of my debt there, but even though at a max 18% APR it would help with the credit card stuff, I'm concerned that this decision would hurt when it comes to the personal loan (unless I take from my savings and pay that off immediately) and school debt.

I'm also considering after reading this subreddit is to possibly apply for a low APR credit card and do a balance transfer of the credit card debt, but wouldn't necessarily solve the school debt issue, and I don't know if I could realistically pay off $6200 over 12 months before a low APR deal ends.

If anyone has any ideas or guidance to offer about how I can approach my situation and any glaring red flags I'm not considering I'd really appreciate it. Maybe I need to do a combination of the above ideas or there's an avenue that I'm unaware of, but regardless I'm aware I haven't made amazing financial choices in the past when it comes to spending and credit, but I'm hoping to make better choices now.

I know after 7 years the collections essentially goes away and it has on some of the stuff I already had in collections. 

I can start paying off the stuff in collections but I saw a TikTok (I know not very reliable haha) that said that you can pay off your debt in collections but the bad mark on the credit is still there. Is that true?

personalfinance,[Question] Retirement Withdrawal: How to be most Tax Efficient between different accounts?,"* Already Retired, currently 68 years old, filing single
* Current income (~40K/yr): Social Security Benefits (~27K/yr,) Pension (~8K/yr), HYSA bank interest (~5K/yr), this is enough to pay all the bills
*  Investments Accounts: Traditional IRA (401K Conversion) at ~200K, Roth IRA, Taxable Brokerage ~200K.

As I don't need any of the investment money right now, I am wondering is it worth it to do small IRA conversions from traditional to roth every year, just to get the money out of pre-tax and to lower the RMD withdrawal in a few years and the growth will grow tax free from this conversion, and my current  income will be the lowest it will ever be because of no RMDs. If so, any rule of thumb on how much should be converted to be most Tax Efficient?

My understanding is the taxable income is 13.5K (half of social security)+ Pension/HYSA interest (13K) =26.5K. So social security benefits will be taxed as it's greater than 25K regardless, as dividends from the taxable brokerage is not considered yet. Do I just base this off the general income tax brackets?  Based on my taxable income calculation,  I am at 26.5K, which means I am in the 12% tax bracket (this bracket is up to 47K in income), is it most tax efficient to do the conversion to bring my taxable income up to 30K or 40K in case to keep myself in that 12% tax rate?

At my current company, my 401k will fully vest on June.. by then this will amount to around $14k in only **employer contributions.**

If I start my new job in January and try and recover by maximizing my contributions, I will still be 5k behind by June.

This is where I'm at a predicament.

Is it worth waiting to start a new job for 5k in a 401k?

On one hand, im in my early 20s so I feel like that 5k have potential to grow into a sizeable amount by the time I retire.

On another hand, it might be best for my career to start the new job as soon as possible...

  
Any opinions?

I always perform a backdoor roth IRA, my partner is usually just able to do a roth no fuss.

I did not realize theres household MAGI limit on roth contributitions. We marginally do not qualify now for direct roth contributions. Problem is my partner already put money into a roth account. It is not invested yet though.

Can she in theory, move that money back into a traditional IRA, then back into the Roth to have it count as a back door? Or is the process ruined by putting it into the roth account first.

personalfinance,How Would HSA Know What I Spent Money On?,"I was recently charged with a $1,200 bill from Atlantic health for my cardiologist appointment from a few weeks ago.

personalfinance,IRAs as a foreigner in the US,"Some background info: I have a 401k through my employer and currently, I do not max out my contributions. I am not a US citizen and don't plan to immigrate or retire here. From my research on reddit, the general consensus for my country nationals in the US is to have traditional IRAs over roth (to take tax savings now rather than later) since my country will likely also tax withdrawals of a Roth IRA. My Federal AGI for 2023 was \~72k and it will be higher this year since I only started working in July 2023. This means that I will exceed the 87k AGI limit for 2024 resulting in no deductions. 

I want to hear feedback from this sub on my thoughts about having IRAs in my situation. My thought process is to open a traditional IRA (which will be non-deductible), basically treat it as a brokerage account for now; and when I leave the country, roll-over my 401k investments into it, and maintain the account. 

Is my logic sound? If that's good logic, I don't even know why I should invest into my brokerage account. I might as well put everything into my traditional IRA. ",1731691645.0

personalfinance,How to prepare for a minor future windfall?,"Throwaway alt for all the security reasons...

Hi all,  
I (47 yo) have a reasonably substantial holding in a pre-IPO startup. I think the IPO, in \~18 months ish, should land at around $15, which would be a gross sale on my side of just north of $1,000,000. I've held the exercised shares from my ISO plan for many years, so this would be capital gains (I think\*). Our typical family yearly income is around $350,000.

What is the best way to plan out how to allocate the proceeds? We have a 10 year old to plan a college savings for, I think we've got about one year of an upmarket (but not Bennington) school in our higher ed savings plan as of now, and anticipate the combined grandparents kicking in around another $50k or so. My spouse is looking at a pension of north of $100k/yr, and we have additional retirement savings, which while not meager aren't enough to do whatever the hell we want. We're tracking normal retirement years (63-67) as of now, due mostly to the pension vest requirements for maximizing the payout.

Additionally, I am now employed at a rocketship style startup, a real market darling, and could potentially have a second future windfall that puts another zero on what I might see from the first.

All in all, kind of a complicated situation taking everything into consideration at once. Before I talk to a financial advisor, I'd like to take the pulse of the kind folks here for some general guidance.

Thanks

\* I was recently informed of some sort of penalty for not holding \_unvested\_ shares that complicates the tax calculations. This was from a SmithBarney investment team that did an equity comp presentation for my company. They claim, and again I have never heard of this before, that the maximum tax benefit is accrued when you hold unvested shares for 12 months, exercise, and hold the exercised shares for an additional 12 months. For the shares I'm discussing here, I held many for more than 12 mo prior to exercising, but when I left the company I had to exercise everything I had vested or the options would have expired. This was ca. 2018, and I had vested shares for the prior 4 years. Sorry for the complication but there it is.",1731691314.0
personalfinance,I’m a 19 year old how am i doing so far,"
Hello, Reddit! I am a 19-year-old who started working full-time at the beginning of this year and decided to focus on improving my finances. I began investing my money in early October and wanted to share my progress with you all. I’d love to hear your opinions and get some constructive criticism.

I’ve learned a lot from reading other posts on this subreddit, and I personally think I’m on the right track. However, I’m eager to gain more knowledge and continue improving.

So far, my current goal is to prioritize maxing out my Roth IRA every year. Once that’s done, I’ll shift my focus to investing in ETFs on Robinhood. In my Roth IRA, I currently have around $6,000, which I’ve allocated as follows: FXAIX - 60%, FSPTX - 20%, FTIHX - 10%, and FXNAX - 10%. I think this split is fairly good, but I’m open to suggestions for improvement.

On Robinhood, I have about $3,500 invested, split between VOO, VTI, and GLD.

I also learned that having an emergency fund is an important step, so I set aside $10,000 in a 12-month flexible CD..

This is my progress so far, and I plan to continue growing my portfolio by investing around $500–$1,000 from my $1,500–$1,700 bi-weekly paycheck.",1731691220.0

Categorization setup is not something that would bother me doing manually the first time, so for example, if I connect a coffee shop with food, whenever I say, I spend money on a coffee shop, it should be categorized as food.

Why I can't save any money. 

Hi this is my first time posting to reddit for advice, I'll just run you down. I work a retail (kinda) based job and I make 15$/hr with tips (per week ranging 40-75$) work 38-41 hours. Live in 1bd apt with boyfriend who makes 19$/hr, works labor intensive job, pays for all the bills but we split rent at 450$ each. He works 38-43 hours depending on the week. 

We both have the same pay period and are full time. When his deposit hits, it's between 1000-1350 respectively and if I'm lucky I make between 790-900 a deposit (tips are done in cash and separately)

We both have a car we share and are co-owners on. This is the second car we bought within our savings in the last 5 months due to our first car we bought getting totaled in a crash just around 4 months of having the car but I need a vehicle for my job, he doesn't, so he had to get another asap so I could return to work. I pay for insurance for both cars because again I'm the one who needs the vehicle for my job and he essentially paid for both cars with his savings while I paid him back over time through other expenses (groceries, gas, etc)

Even with his help, I can't seem to catch up. He has done all the bulk spending to help me get to my job and help me live and asking for anything else causes more burden on our relationship on top of the financial stress. I want to properly pay him back and get myself situated where I'm not drowning, even if I'm constantly swimming, I don't want to drown anymore!

I owe 178,000 on my house and have at least $100,000 of equity in it. My mortgage is $1800 and I could rent it out in my area likely for about $2700.

Considering the cost for a Property Manager and other maintenance, I might make about $500 a month renting out my house. 

However, if we sell it, we can take that equity and use it toward another house or have a sizable emergency fund / extra money for investing.

personalfinance,House is paid off -- would you move right now?,"Tl;Dr: my husband would prefer a new home to remodeling the one we have. What would you do in this economy?

We fully own our house built in 1984. We've put a lot of time and effort into making it a home including new insulation, new floors, all sorts of new things to make it better and nicer. 

But the one thing that we cannot add or change is the amount of space and the bathrooms. They are small and a constant source of frustration for my husband because we do not really have a ""master suite.""

We also have a considerable plot of land for the area. Only 3/4 of an acre but it's three times as large as most of the lots in our neighborhood. 

Anyway, we paid off the house earlier this year but my husband appears to be getting stir crazy..

We could afford a new home even with a ridiculous interest rates these days, but I'm mixed on whether or not it is ""worth it.""

For reference, homes around here at the size we're looking at are going from anywhere from $350,000 to $700,000.

We could likely spend half of the cost of the kinds of houses that we're looking at and put an addition on our house. But, it would likely mean we couldn't live in it for a period of time while that was happening. This is all just spitballing we haven't gotten any designs or contacted a contractor or anything like that. The home being two story is also complicates things because the addition would have to be both stories as well.

When I bought this house I ensured that I could do it by myself because at the time we were not married yet. We both work in tech so I am very wary of one of us being laid off with no warning and taking on a huge investment when we don't absolutely 100% need to seems silly. But it would be nice to have a larger space to raise our family and be able to support both of our sets of parents as they age.

We have a considerable emergency fund and we've been saving all of the money that we used to be paying for the mortgage this past few months. So we're doing really well all things considered.

So yeah what would you do with interest rates being where they are and home prices being crazy in my opinion, would you move away from a fully paid off home into a new one at this point?",1731690079.0

I checked out the flowchart in the Wiki and tried to make a decent plan to tackle my finances.

**Loans (\~$43k)**

* $6k in car loan
   * 5.24% interest rate
* $37k in student loans
   * 2.75% to 3.75% for private loans
   * 2.75% to 5.5% for federal loans (mostly unsubsidized)

**Financial Situation**

* $16k currently in high-yield savings account
* $70k salary
   * $4k sign-on bonus
   * 5% to 401k to max out company match
   * $25 per paycheck to HSA

  
My current plan is to pay off my car loan (i know the interest rate is less than my larger federal loans) with some of the money I have in my HYSA, and leave the rest as an emergency fund ($10k). So that will get rid of my monthly car payment. Then, hit minimum payments on my student loans ($430 per month) which will set me up to have them paid off by 2034 :/. Then basically redirect what I was paying for my car loan to my Roth IRA (\~$250). Combining this with the budget I made, my expenses would be pretty much equal to my post-tax income. 

Given I haven't moved yet and really don't know how my budget will shape out, I'll probably hold off on contributing to my Roth for the first month or two to get a better feeling of what my budget looks like. Additionally, trying to furnish an apartment and everything that goes along with that. But ultimately, the goal would be to put any leftover money into my Roth. 

Does this plan seem like a solid way to tackle debt/retirement? I'm definitely open to any suggestions or feedback.

I'm currently reading ""simple path to wealth"" by JL Collins, and the author talks a lot about investing in VTSAX. I have a few dumb questions as a newbie...

First is, I currently have a charles scwhab account, and through research online I found out that scwhab has an equivalent to VTSAX, SWTSX. Will investing in SWTSX have the same effect as investing in VTSAX? It seems like the author is really emphasizing that people invest in VTSAX specifically. Is there some kind of penalty to having both a vanguard and schwab account?

my second question is, once you put money in a roth IRA, is there anything more you need to do with it? I think i've maxxed out the yearly contribution, but someone told me I have to invest the money in the account? I don't know, I'm confused.

Any tips would be appreciated, thanks!",1731687058.0
personalfinance,Need help understanding roth conversions and pro rata rule,"I have an employer 401(k) with pre-tax and post-tax money. For simplicity, let's say $2m pre-tax and $1m post-tax. I am hoping to retire in my 50s and do roth conversion laddering in my early retirement years. From my understanding, this is where you take a portion of your pre-tax (traditional) funds and convert them to post-tax (roth) funds but can't touch the converted funds penalty-free for 5 years, and the converted amount counts as taxable income for that year.

Do I need to check if my employer 401(k) plan will allow me to do these future roth conversions? MY company uses the financial institution: Alight. Would it ever make any sense to roll these funds to a Fidelity account to do my roth conversions (I have a Roth IRA and taxable brokerage account with Fidelity)? Am I going to run into any issues because my portfolio is a mix of pre-tax and post-tax money? I've never done a ""backdoor roth conversion"" and given my income/strategy/savings, I never plan to. And trying to research this, I'm running into a ""pro rata"" rule but don't quite understand it.",1731686637.0

personalfinance,American living in German - IRA?,"I am American living temporarily (2 years) in Germany for work. I have a 401k with a branch of the same company that I work for back in the states that I'm keeping as a 401k since I'll be going back to that company eventually. I also have a TSP account from when I was in the military. 

I've been reading some financial books and figured it's high time to bring my TSP to a different bank so I can actually contribute to it (I'm no longer a government employee, so can't contribute to it any more). 

When trying to sign up for a Schwab rollover, I was asked what country I live in. Yes, technically it's not the USA, but for the sake of where the money lives, it's the USA and I still have an address in the USA. 

But I also know moving money around when overseas can be... questionable and don't really want my taxes to go crazy or have the IRS coming after me. 

Any advice? I earn a small amount from a rental property and military disability, so while you could say ""What's the point of doing all of this while overseas when you can't contribute"", in my case, I am able to contribute still. ",1731685820.0
personalfinance,Need advice on a financial advisor or financial planner,"Hi, I'm 61, single (gray divorced), still working, living alone, no family  I have a 401k , decent savings, no debt other than rent.

I never had a financial advisor or financial planner. I don't feel going to a financial advisor who will charge me 1% of my current investments at this stage of my life. Am I wrong?

personalfinance,Overwhelmed and ashamed of debt,"Hello everyone

I'm writing from an alternate account, this is how terrified I am of anyone knowing how much I owe in CC Debt.

I'm 41 married with two young kids. I wake up every night at 3-4 am, overwhelmed with guilt and shame at how I've allowed us to get into this hole. I have been reading post from this account for a few weeks but first time posting.

I make 80k and my husband makes similar 70-80k (he's hourly so fluctuates but at tax time it's usually similar to my income)

We owe $70k in CC Debt. 25k in personal loan. (poor choice in paying off debt and did what was predictable-accumulated cc debt in addition to loan) 7k in car loan (0% interest and will be paid off next year). This debt originated from 2020-2023. Won't get into why we are in this much debt but I have done a lot of work to shift my mindset around money and addressing it now. We've always had CC debt, but it's always been just a card or two and we come out of it. Never have we ever been in a hole like this and I am terrified.

As of right now I am following the 'Get out of Debt' by Erin Skye Kelly. She recommends an emergency fund which I have at 5k. I have depleted and filled this account a few times due to car problems, dental visits, vet bills, house issues, etc. but have managed to not accumulate new CC debt since starting her program. I am also in therapy and have really done a money 180. I am a lot better with impulse shopping and sticking to a budget compared to years past.

However, I am feeling so overwhelmed. I am working a 2nd job and all of that money goes to replenish my savings and/or pay off a CC, however the work is not consistent month to month but I am really trying to get more work when I can. My husband also works overtime as much as he can as well and this really helps with paying the minimums per month. 

For monthly expenses, we have internet, cellphones, car insurance, life insurance, kids after school activities (150-200/mo) and a few streaming such as Disney, Netflix, and Peacock. The usual household bills, oil and electricity. I try to shop at Aldi's when I can but due to time constraints (it's 30 min away) I will shop what's on sale at supermarkets in town. We do order out on Friday nights but I we decided from here until after Christmas we will not go out to eat to save that money for Christmas costs. With our take home pay we are paying those household bills and all of the minimums but there is barely anything extra to pay off the CC. 

I am feeling so stuck. The interest rates are so high (18-29%) that I can't seem to dig myself out. I have called to lower interest rates but most of them say I have to apply through a credit agency. I am hesitant to do this b/c I've read how they're not always helpful in the long wrong. I am going to try again to call all of the CC and see if they will lower their interest rates. 

Any other advice? Anyone been in my shoes and can offer some hope? Can anyone commiserate? If nothing else, thank you for reading as I have no one in my circle to process this with. ",1731685018.0
personalfinance,How to invest $11k gift that I can’t touch until dad dies? ,"Background:
My 69 year old dad recently entered skilled nursing for dementia. He could die soon, or he could live for many more years, as he’s otherwise able-bodied and healthy.

As his POA for property, I’m working with an elder law attorney to gift some of his remaining money to me and my two siblings as part of his Medicaid planning. After purchasing a Medicaid compliant annuity to cover the penalty period he’s going to be assessed for the gift, my siblings and I will each get a check for around $11,300. We’ve signed a Family Settlement Agreement saying that we won’t spend the money until our dad dies, and that if he incurs costs between now and his death that aren’t covered by Medicaid, we’ll split the costs three ways from our gifted money. His needs are minimal at this point, so these costs aren’t likely to be very high. We each have to create new accounts to deposit the money, and my siblings have to list me as the beneficiary of their accounts (as his POA), and I have to list my siblings as 50/50 beneficiaries on mine. 

I’ve confirmed with the lawyer that we can invest the money, as long as we follow the beneficiary requirements. 

So, how would you invest the money? ",1731684911.0
personalfinance,How do I handle this dental payment out of my HSA?,"My understanding is that I can pay my dental expenses out of my HSA.

My dentist takes my insurance, but requires full payment for services up front. So for a $200 service, I would pay $200 up front, they would file it with my insurance, insurance would say they cover $150, and then I would get a check a few weeks later for the $150 that insurance covered. So the total paid by me is $50, and the total paid by insurance is $150.

I'm going to have an HSA next year and I'm trying to determine how I handle payment here. Do I pay $200 out of my HSA and then still get the insurance check back, or am I paying $200 out of pocket and can only claim / pull out of my HSA 3 weeks later the $50 I was responsible for? I'm guessing the latter but just trying to manage this niche case.",1731684764.0
personalfinance,Took a car loan to build credit. Trying to calculate how much to pay upfront.,"Hope y'all are doing well.

I am very ignorant about credit so please give comments and feedback.

I have practically no credit history. I took out a car loan to build credit (I took out the minimum amount the dealership would loan me). I am able to pay the entire loan off. Papers have been signed, I'll receive the loan in about 30 days.

Loan Details:
- Loaned Amount - $9,968.22
- APR - 25.46% (I know it's high)
- Loan Duration: 60 months
- Payment Amount: $298.36


My plan:
I set a limit of $500 for interest. I'm trying to build credit, but not kill my finances building it. 

If I can pay towards the principle, I plan on paying $9,300 towards the principle the moment I get the loan and can pay. Then pay the new monthly $20 for the full 60 months. 

If I can't pay towards the principle I plan on paying ~9,000 upfront then paying the last couple months at the $298.36/month rate.

In about 6 months I plan on getting a credit card for everyday expenses (I'll just pay it off in full every month).",1731684105.0
