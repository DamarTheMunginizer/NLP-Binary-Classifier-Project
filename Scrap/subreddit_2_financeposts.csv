personalfinance,ATM didn‚Äôt give me my cash ,"so I recently used an out-of-network ATM at a random convenience store in my area. Not the smartest choice, but I needed cash, and it was the closest ATM to me. I withdrew $200, but the ATM never gave me the cash, even though the money was deducted from my checking account. I went to the store worker, showed him my receipt, and explained that the ATM didn‚Äôt dispense my cash. I asked if he could give me the money from the register, but he said he couldn‚Äôt do that. He looked at the ATM and mentioned it might be out of order, but he wasn‚Äôt sure. When I asked how I could get my money back, he said he had no idea and gave me a phone number to call. I‚Äôve tried calling the number, but I haven‚Äôt been able to reach anyone. The ATM didn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúout of order‚Äù sign and seemed to be working normally, so I‚Äôm really confused about why this happened. How can I go about getting my money back?

personalfinance,Access to cash advice,"I may be the walking definition of cash poor/asset rich. 

I quit my job in tech sales at 31.  I am now 44 and have not worked/collected a paycheck since 2011, or 13 years.   Sometimes I joke my job is to not have a job. 

In 2013 I purchased a home with cash with my sales commission savings.   Could not get a loan obv without a w2, and while I understand the benefits of leverage, because it was a cash deal, this property provides me with $3k/month in passive income now which also works out to roughly a 12-16% guaranteed rate of return on the initial investment not even counting appreciation,  depending how you want to calculate the numbers (including/excluding property tax, insurance,  remodeling costs etc)

Have no desire to sell the property which is my primary/only source of income. 

Anyways,  in 15 years I can access my 401k/Roth which hovers around $1M.  I have a retail account roughly of $100k  that I sell off whenever I have cost over runs on my cc bill (which has been a lot lately) but effectively everything thing I sell off is not only present value but also the opportunity cost to compound.

So it's a balancing act. 

No kids except myself. 

Anyways,  TLDR, on paper,  house with no mortgage.   Between that and retirement accounts,  $2M in assets. 

$3k a month in income. 

Any ways to access more cash with no employment and no desire for employment?

Thanks for any advice and consideration.

personalfinance,"What‚Äôs my best route to $0 debt (401k withdrawl, 401k loan, personal loan, sell car etc)?","Hi all,

Long time reader, first time poster. I'll give the stats below and see if there are any suggestions from the forum. Bottom line is I am in pretty deep with debt, but the good news is I just got a new job with about a 40% pay raise. I just want to hopefully optimize getting out of debt, reduce interest, etc.

Income:

* $150k/yr pre tax
* $7100 per month post tax, 401k, brokerage investment etc.
* I put about $350 per month into my current 401k and $600 into my brokerage

Debt / Open Credit:

* $20,000 balance / $21,000 limit Personal Capital One Venture - Interest is \~$300/month at 17.75%
* $18,000 balance / $19,000 limit Personal BofA - Zero interest until 4/2024, then 15.7% after
* $0 balance / $25,000 limit Personal Capital One VentureOne
* $0 balance / $21,000 limit Personal Chase
* $0 balance Amex - shared with partner for shared daily expenses

Expenses:

* $2,250 / month rent
* $2,500 - $3,000 / month each shared expenses with partner
* $1,000 / month non-shared personal expenses

Assets:

* $83,000 - $88,000 in my 401k from last job (left about 2 months ago, so will likely convert it to an IRA soon)
* $2k current 401k
* $1.5k post-tax brokerage
* Car worth \~$6,000, paid off - GF has a car too

Other:

* Credit rating is right around 700
* Biggest thing bringing it down right now is I'm hovering right around 30% credit usage, and I think a tick over that which has brought it below 700 (698)
* Capital One offered 12 months at 0% APR on my ventureOne account for balance transfers 

My debt ultimately started with the memestonk debacle back in 2021, margin call, etc etc. My investing now is simply buying shares of market ETFs and I learned my lesson there.

I used to make about around $80k in 2020 / 2021, then $100-$105k a year for the last few years before I got my new job in September for a pay bump up to $150k. Unfortunately, I joined a startup and to be honest the future of the company is rather up in the air. Which comes up in my options below. The new company is ending their 401k match at EOY.

I keep track of all of my expenses from my shared and personal credit card on an excel document, so I have a good sense of where the money is going by category each month. We don't eat out more than a couple times a month, and I think we're done with travel until about April or so. I try to be frugal wherever possible but I also don't want to have this ruin my life and turn to living like I used to during college etc.

So, I think my options are:

1. Withdraw enough from my 401k/IRA to cover my credit card debt - which I think is the lowest stress option for me now and gives me a fresh start to contribute a lot to my IRA/401k down the line. Yes, I will take a big hit on my retirement savings but I am now earning a lot more and would be able to contribute more monthly with my debt being gone.

2. Roll my old 401k into my current 401k, and take a loan out on it to pay off my CC debt at a 9% interest rate - the problem here is if the company goes under, or gets acquired, or if I get fired, that amount is due within 90 days, or I have to then pay the tax penalties as if I just withdrew it.

3. Debt consolidation loan - I've been getting far too many emails and calls harassing me after trying to look for a loan here. General specs would be $1,800 a month for 2 years (14.7%), $1,300 a month for 3 years (15.3%, $1,000 for 4 years (16.2%). The other APRs don't seem to make sense given where my current balance APR is at. I'm leaning away from doing the 2 year because that is a huge monthly payment. The 3 or 4 year payments seem more palatable given my expenses but still very unsure about this option.

4. Sell my car to put a big dent in the capital one balance, then try to control spending and pay down the Capital One balance first, but in April I'll start getting interest charged on the BofA balance, and will need to strategize after that. Capital One has offered a year of 0% on balance transfers, and I'm seeing how long that will last before transferring my BofA balance there.

5. I suppose I could also zero out my 401k contributions, zero out brokerage contributions and pay it down that way, but I‚Äôm eating interest payments. 

Are there other options I should be considering?

Should I just take the risk to take the 401k loan out, and do a big enough loan to keep enough to cover the taxes in my brokerage etc if something bad does happen with my job and I have to pay the penalties? I could take a \~$45k loan from my 401k, pay off my two balances and then stash the rest in my post-tax brokerage account in something stable, just in case I have to pay off the taxes and penalty if I get fired / the company goes under.

Part of me feels confident in making enough money in the future where I want to just take the taxes and penalties from taking out enough from my 401k, just to wipe everything out and have my mind at ease. No credit hit either.

I appreciate any input and help! ",1732081098.0

personalfinance,Laid off: What to do with 401k?,"My wife was laid off and we don't know what to do about her 401k?

**BACKGROUND:**  

We're in our mid/late 50's and we were hoping she'd be able to retire in 2-3 years (I'll keep working for another 10 years or so).  Obviously with her income going from pretty decent to zero puts a wrinkle in the plans as we just don't have enough saved and living solely off my income will be tight but possibly doable (I'm self employed, so I don't have a 401k or pension).

Besides the modest size 401k, we both have an IRA that we opened 3 years ago (1 is pre-tax, one is post-tax = because we had no clue what we were doing).  The IRAs have preformed amazingly well, but even so, the total dollar amount isn't huge (the contribution's were capped, and there has only been 3 years of contributions, though at our ages I think we put in a little more than someone younger could have).

We have a pretty low COL and aren't material/money driven (which is good in that we don't need a ton of money to live on, but bad in that we don't have a ton saved up either).  With our ""retirement funds"" (401k + IRAs + Savings) I estimate that we currently have about half of what we need to get by on in retirement.  

Our plan had been for both of us to continue working and to continue to max 401k and IRA contributions for 2-3 more years (at which point we'd hoped to have our house paid off and our kids be financially self sufficient).  Then she'd retire and we'd live off my income for another 7-8 years until we both hit 65, with the hope/thinking that that money saved would grow some over those years without us having to put more into it (thus giving us a much more comfortable retirement, especially if it came close to doubling over those years).  But now with her income zero, it changes things. 

I'll also note that at her age she doesn't want (nor does she think she can get) a corporate job like she had, and ideally would like a fairly ""low stakes"" position (part time would be ideal to try out partial retirement, but we may need her to work full time just to gain access to healthcare) and thus likely she will be making about half of what she used to.  Month to month that should be OK (assuming Obamacare isn't too expensive if she doesn't get a full time job) but it will limit (to zero?) how much we can support the kids and likely we won't be able to add any to our retirement funds.

**QUESTIONS:**

1. Do we leave the 401k where it's at (and I assume pay the company some sort of management fee)?
2. Do we move it to one of our IRAs?  And if so, do we have a choice of which one?  (I think hers is the post-tax one but I'd have to double check)
3. If we have a choice, is Fidelity or Charles Schwab a better choice?  (my IRA is at Fidelity, hers is at Schwab)
4. For years we've maintained keeping 6 months of living money in a savings account (with crap yield, but it's our safety net/emergency fund).  With the upcoming year and all the unknowns, we're unsure if digging into that to make IRA contributions is something we're comfortable with, so likely won't contribute anything.  Is that dumb?  Our kids are both fairly recent college grads with low paying jobs and we still help them financially a decent amount.  1 lives in a MCOL area and is pretty close to being able to live off her own income, but the other is on the East coast in a HCOL area and she doesn't make much more than minimum wage (plus she's applying to grad schools, so her expenses may go way up while her income goes down some).
5. Sort of related:  At what age do parents stop helping their children financially?  Neither of our parents helped us at all past 18, but we're trying to help our kids avoid the struggles we went through.  Our plan has always been to help as much as we can (which was a decent amount) up until they're 26 (and forced off our health insurance, which seemed like a good age to plant the flag at).  We don't want them stressing about our finances, nor do we want them to get into a pinch and us not be able to help them.  So how do (decent) parents handle the financial ""separation""?

We've got about 647 more questions, but at the moment those are the ones we feel the most worried about.

Thanks and I appreciate any/all advice!

I don‚Äôt know anything about loans, and I‚Äôm pretty scared to have absolutely any debt for fear of not having enough to pay it back before the interest causes me to pay even more, like I‚Äôll never be able to pay it off.

I want to be able to afford the car and pay it off quickly, and my main issues are these two. 1) If I get a loan sooner, and get the car, the loan will be a lot bigger, needing $6,000 or so, it would make work commute much easier, and allow for more flexibility, but I would need to pay monthly for insurance, the loan, gas, and other car expenses, which may make it difficult to feel comfortable with my savings/income. 
Or, option 2) I can try and work as much as possible before the weather gets worse, which the work isn‚Äôt hard, but I chance a lot of risk having to ride a bike upwards of 20-30 miles daily, which is mentally and physically exhausting, and I would be doing it nearly everyday, but it lets me save money for a car.

I (F19) in my senior year of high school decided to open a traditional IRA to get started early on my fiances (I believe either around the age of 17 or just as I turned 18).

Now I'm not really financially literate, (I understand the concepts of things but when it comes to the depth, a manual for dummies does their best), but I know closing an IRA account can get you taxed a pretty penny. But idk if keeping it open and empty can get me in financial trouble as well.

personalfinance,Buying your own car and path to adulthood,"Hi guys,

I am 28M, single, and live with fam in the bay area. I use my family's car to commute and I make about $100K a year with savings.

I'm getting to the age where I feel like (also with societal pressure) I should have my own things i.e. my own car and my own place to live. However, I am happy living with family until I have even more money saved, and/or until I meet someone to move out with. With that said, I recently found a car I really like (mazda cx-50 hybrid), and I wondered to myself if it's time to buy my own car. With tax, fees, etc the car would likely be \~$45K, which I can afford. However, it doesn't feel like a need but more so a want. My family don't really use cars that much, except for me. We have a 2014 subaru forester and 2007 toyota camry which are very robust cars.

As I have implied, I feel like having my own car would be a boost in the current dating world. Though, I also recognize that it could also be my own ego/confidence talking. Would you buy a car in my story? How else would you use this money? I'm curious to see what other people think and if they have any advice for my scenario.

She would've been able to on her own only if we weren't going to move in since the amount she could've put more towards the down payment was used for the construction of our space. So his name is on there for 10% but he didn't put any down payment or contribute to anything beforehand. We moved in about 6 months after the property was purchased and started paying my mother rent. Not sure if this is important info, but any home reparirs, like a new roof, have only been funded by my mom. All my ex partner has paid for is rent. We had plans to get married but unfortunately something in his mental health declined and he is undiagnosed for whatever can cause auditory hallucinations and paranoia which in turn have made him aggressive and I ended the relationship. He's been refusing to leave on his own until his name is taken off. We've been living as roommates for over a year due to trying to figure out when we could actually apply for a quit claim. We applied a few months ago to see if my mom would qualify on her own but it was rejected and she was told if she took care of clearing/ lowering some debts it would be possible. She's done so now and got the paperwork to try again and now he refuses to sign. He's been adamant on just wanting to get his name removed and signed the first time around but it seems like due to his condition and these feelings of animosity he has, he's refusing now. Seems like lawyers are going to have to get involved.

Last month I got 

\- New tires at $1.1k out the door 

\- New MacBook that is $1.2 out the door

Last month I lost $730 as I pay rent a day early for this month as well. 

I've paid all my rent and utilities for this month. My next paycheck on Friday would get me to $2300 in savings this month. 

Here are some other expenses that I still need to make.

\- Iphone 15: The battery on my 11 is on its way out. I was thinking to upgrade on Black Friday to take advantage of the gift card discounts for the Apple Store (more on that below). This is around $780 after taxes. 

\- Apple care for the MacBook. My plan is to get the apple care for my MacBook using the gift card to pay part of it. It is either $70 a year auto renewed or $200 for 3 years. Which one is a better deal? 

\- Microsoft office. I'm unable to transfer my old Microsoft word onto my new one, so I have to get a new one on my Mac. That is $130 at least. I've been relying on google docs for now. 

So here, it is about $1110. 

$2300-1110 =$1,190.00 savings this month.

  
I think I'll be spending another $250 for the rest of this month on food, groceries, gas and a haircut. This is a very conservative estimate. That would leave me with $940 of savings this month. If I combine that with last month then I would only end up saving $200 for October and November combined. 

I technically have about $200 I can get reimbursed from my HSA for expenses but right now the insurance wants to reprocess my claim so I don't want to be reimbursed and have to pay back.

personalfinance,Buyer's Remorse? Thinking of selling my new car for a cheaper one.,"Hi everyone, 

I'm seeking advice on of it's a sensical decision to sell my current car that I bought new for a cheaper one that I'll have paid off sooner; or if I should just keep grinding away and accept the sunk cost.  

Long story short, I got divorced a year ago and was in need of a car. Maybe hastily, I bought a 2024 Subaru Crosstrek. I'm overall pleased with the car. I don't really want to sell it, but I hate having a car payment more than I thought I would. I'm definitely feeling the strain on my wallet. And, I'd rather use the funds for savings and travel. 

I split the financing between an auto loan at 5.39% and a HELOC at 3.25%. The total original balance was around $32,000.

The current balance on the auto is \~ $11,800 and payments are $300/mo. 

The current balance on the HELOC is \~ $14,200. Minimum payment \~ $140, but I am paying $300. 

The reason I'm paying more on the HELOC is because I'd like to free up the funds to actually use for my home improvements. 

So total debt against the car is \~ $26k. I've paid down around $6k in a year and a half. 

Between the two loans, trying to pay it off early,  I am paying $600/mo for it, which I can swing but I'm definitely feeling the pinch. Auto insurance is about $80/mo. 

For simplicity's sake and not having a back up car in the meantime, I'm assuming I would end up trading at a dealership and best case, break even on the debt against it.  

I do also get a small bonus in the new year where I'd apply at least $1,500 towards the auto loan. 

  


A couple of options going on in my head to get out of this loan:

1.) Trade and get a $10-$15k car---then I have to worry about breaking down/maintenance without a back up car or person. I estimate this would be \~ $10k less of a loan though.

2.) Decrease 410k contributions from 11% down to 5% which is the company match- this would free up \~$200/mo to apply to a loan. I am currently earning 8% on my 401k though. 

3.) Just keep my head down. Eat beans and rice. Apply any extra funds to the auto loan. 

  
Any advice/input welcome! Thank you!!

This year has been tough to say the least. Between switching jobs, getting residential treatment for a medical condition, my father dying unexpectedly with no will/assets or life insurance, and an 10 day hospital stay (all of which resulted in significant unpaid time off of work), my family is destitute and in massive amounts of debt.

Currently, I am unemployed and a full-time college student, about a year away from finishing an Associate's degree. I want to complete my classes.

For context, the mistake I made was allowing the company to think my secondary insurance was my primary. Unfortunately, they don‚Äôt accept my primary insurance, and my secondary insurance won‚Äôt pay because they are not liable (which I completely understand). Please don‚Äôt make my mistake!

personalfinance,asked to co-sign parents' bridge loan,"edit: confirmation is all i needed. wish i could help, but i don't think this is the move. here's hoping they don't hold this against me.  
  
Hi all, hoping you can all help me out here with a sanity check.

My parents currently own a \~900k home with no mortgage. They worked with a builder to build a $500k home. The plan has been to sell the old home and buy the new home. The new home finished much earlier than expected and the builders are trying to close ASAP. My parents just found out so they're listing their existing home this week.

My parents want to get a bridge loan, here's how it works from my understanding:

This loan company will give my parents a loan for the 500k for the new home. They have also made an offer to purchase the old home for well below market value. My parents will have a few months to try and sell their home for more, but if they can't, they're stuck with the below market sale, but at least the sale is guaranteed.

They are okay with all these terms. I would not be if I were in their position. The closing cost fees and the lowball offer are what I would consider predatory, but the difference between the offer they've received and the value of the new home is more than enough to pay these ridiculous fees. They're aware of it, they're okay with it.

But due to my parent's terrible credit, they need someone to cosign on the bridge loan. It kind of blows my mind that their credit is so bad, that they need a cosigner for a bridge loan where the sale home is worth almost 400k more than the new home. It must be really bad.

I want to help my parents, but I need to understand the risks involved. My original concern was ""what happens if/when they can't sell the house?"" The answer seems to be: my parents get bent over a barrel and sell it for much less than market rate but still walk away with something extra. But at least I wouldn't be on the hook for making any kind of mortgage payment.

What questions should I be asking? My wife and I are close to being able to buy our first home, our timeline is Fall 2025 at the very earliest. What can go wrong that can affect our ability to buy?

Will co-signing on a bridge loan remove my eligibility for first time homebuyer programs?

Would this ding my credit rating, and if so, how long would it take to recover? My current experian score is 815.

Would this count towards my debt : income ratio?

Once the house sale is made, will the closing of the bridge loan ding my credit score?

Again, i see how awful this deal is for my parents. They're okay with it and willing to pay the predatory fees out of their profits. What are the worst case scenarios for me if I do decide to help them?",1732060525.0

I normally paid online every month with no issue. In June of 2022 I received a message on the HMF website ‚Äúerror cannot process payment at this time‚Äù. I called Hyundai and they informed me it was an error on the website and I could mail a check.

I mailed a check which was never cashed.

This issue proceeds from June-August of 2022. Online payment can‚Äôt be processed, advised to mail a check by Hyundai customer service which is never cashed.

I spoke to a representative on the phone about the possibility of Hyundai incorrectly reporting a late payment, and was assured that notes were made in my file about the issue and any issue would be corrected.

In September of 2022 Hyundai reports my account as 90 days late. I call for an explanation and am told my checks were not cashed because they are from a ‚Äúnon-eligible‚Äù bank account. I then am presented with the option to pay over the phone, which I do with my debit card from the same ‚Äúnon eligible‚Äù bank account. I then ask for the 90 day remark to be removed because I attempted to pay the debt on time and Hyundai refused to cash my mailed checks, and not take payment online.

I was assured the remark would be removed. I asked for this in writing and was told that Hyundai does not provide communications in writing, only billing statements are provided in writing once a month.

The remark is eventually removed and the technical error is fixed. I finish paying all of my payments on time online for the rest of the lease.

I turn in the lease July 2024. 6 weeks later I receive a letter in the mail from Hyundai stating I owe $977.50 in fees and repairs. I purchased wear and tear coverage from Hyundai. I call Hyundai and inform them the bill I have received is wrong because I have purchased insurance and to send me a corrected bill.

In October I receive a letter stating I owe $0. Today I get a credit alert Hyundai reported me delinquent on October 31 for an owed balance of $0, and updated my previously removed 90 day delinquency as back on my report with another superfluous December late payment added on.

What does everyone advise for a dispute letter to the bureaus?

I have some large paper gains on NVDA, all long-term holds, and I was curious if the smartest move is to sell some of this now to cover either $7,000 in gains, presuming that then I would not be taxed capital gains taxes on said NVDA sale, or at least $4,000 in gains, leaving me with $3,000 in loss for the year.

Since I am not working and don't plan to, it feels foolish to leave the money in the 401k where I'm just losing $30 a month (it doesn't look like there are any interest returns that I can see - if I'm mistaken, lmk). 

Should I withdraw the money, pay off my remaining CC debt, and place the rest in a HYSA (I would lose \~$8.5k to taxes/penalties)? Should I open an IRA where there might be more fees for holding a stagnant amount of money? What's the best situation if I won't be adding more money to the total for the next couple of years?",1732057340.0

Hello everyone, my family and I recently moved from China to Indiana, USA. My wife and I have two children, aged 12 and 10. My wife stays at home to take care of the children, and I continue to work in China, earning roughly $300,000 per year. Since we do not have employment in the U.S., we don‚Äôt have access to 401(k) plans or other typical retirement options here.

We would appreciate any insights on investment strategies, tax planning, insurance, or other approaches that can help us secure a stable future.

personalfinance,Am I crazy for not wanting to use a 401k for retirement?,"I know this is crazy and people might hate on me but I really don't see why you would save money in a 401k for retirement. I understand the tax benefits, but to me it makes much more sense to me to invest your money instead into things will provide you a return, such as businesses or real estate. Some reasons why I think so:

1. **There is no time limit.** This is one of the things that always confused me about retirement planning. You have to assume you'll die and stop needing money at a certain age. What happens if you live past that? With the way things are looking people my age (24) can't count on social security, I doubt it will look the same and may not even be there by the time I'm 80. Also what if I live to be 100? It just doesn't really make sense to me.
2. **You have something to pass on.** If all you do throughout your life is build up a treasure chest that you can live off of when you are ready to stop working where does that leave your kids and/or grandkids? When I pass away I would love to be able to leave a lot for my loved ones, and I hope I don't have to sell it off (As I would a 401k) just to pay for my lifestyle.
3. **You can use the money as you grow old.** For a 401k you are locked into using it at a specific age unless you want to pay penalties for taking it early. Instead of waiting until you are old I think it is better to be able to use your investment's returns as you are getting old. I understand that with compound interest a 401k account would grow also, but it is very hard to use it for specific opportunities such as a business or real estate deal.

I know I'm probably forgetting some, so I'll most likely edit this as time goes on.

**TLDR: Investing in real estate is better for your retirement than owning a 401k. Fight me bro.**",1732055965.0

We are switching to one of the two options that my work provides now instead, and I'm leaning toward ""Surest"", the 0 deductible option that a lot of co-workers have used and said good things about, but my company also added a $2000 hsa contribution, on top of the \~$1500 saved in taxes on my own HSA contributions, and since I'm not positive how much this birth will cost, I'm not sure how the math will work out and I what point I am ahead on either plan.

A co-worker said that they had a baby last year and literally just had a couple bills totaling to \~$700 in copays, that Surest was extremely easy to work with, and they were able to see exactly what the bills would all be before the procedure. We paid about $5,500 out of pocket last year on 20% co-insurance.

I think expenses would still be low enough that we wouldn't hit the out of pocket max on HDHP (which is effectively $4k lower than the Surest plan), but I could be wrong?

personalfinance,Participate is ESPP that provides 1 for 1 share match after 3 years if not confident I'll stay?,"This opportunity is for my wife. Seems like a great deal to essentially double that money plus stock rise (hopefully). Investment is 1-5% of salary over 12 months. Then the company will match the shares purchased 3 years after each purchase date. So, from the first purchase date to the last match date will be 4 years.

It's a large defense company, but where my wife works is a new manufacturing building and there are a lot of growing pains. She enjoys what she does but the struggle of getting everything going is eating at her. Difficult to say how confident she is that she'll stay for the next 4 years. Let's just say if something opens up in the area that she's interested in, she'd look into it. Not a lot of opportunities for similar work here though and we have no desire to move.

Stock price should be fine. Large defense company, with recent large contracts, and no sign of stopping.

Math I'm considering. Assume 100k salary. So, 5% participation would be 5k.
1) Assuming 401k goes up 7%/yr, in 4 years, that 5k would be ~6.5k.
2) If we realize the match in 4 years and the stock goes nowhere, that 5k would be 10k. But you are ""taxed on the value of your matching shares as wage income."" Assuming tax bracket of 32%, that 10k is actually 8.4k.
3) If we participate in the ESPP, the stock goes nowhere, and she leaves right before any match, we'd lose out on ~1k of growth if it had been in 401k with 7%/yr growth.

Do you think it's worth it to participate if it means removing that 5k from the employer 401k with the uncertainty of staying at the company? The 401k matching contribution will not be effected.

I have spent the last two years working with a therapist and studying financial literacy, and I have resolved a lot of my financial self-sabotage. Everything felt possible until April 2023, when my car got totaled. The car market was recovering from COVID-19, supply was limited, and used cars were absurdly overpriced. I instead leased a new 2023 Nissan Rogue. I went from having a paid-off 2011 Kia Sorento to a $564 lease payment. That was when I knew I had to change significantly to turn this pattern around.

Since then, I have moved from an extremely HCOL area to a LCOL area, which also cut my renters and car insurance in half, I haven't added any debt to my credit cards and stick to monthly budgets, I took on a second job and have seen a change in myself but no change in my finances. I used to need a car for work but now that I moved I wfh and could go without a car for a while, however it is not as easy as just selling it as its a lease.

So, the path forward seems to be that I should get a loan for the car, turn around and sell it, and then go without a car and put the car payments towards my CC debt. This is fine and dandy, except I have maxed out my CCs and can't get approved for the car loan. So I plan to cash out my 401K to pay off some CC debt, improve my credit score enough for the car loan, buy and sell the car, and then put the extra money towards rebuilding the 401K and CC debt.

Chase: $6,431.75/6,500 at 22.49% ($289.75/month)

USAA: $2,436.08/2,500 at 28.65% ($125.00/month)

She lives in Kentucky, and she has been with my stepfather (though they were never legally married) for over 14 years. During this time, he handled all financial responsibilities‚Äîhousing, bills, groceries, etc. Unfortunately, they are now separating on bad terms, leaving my mother without any financial stability or assets to her name, my ""step father"" is saying he owes her nothing and since they were never legally married he doesn't need to take care of her or help her anymore and is completely kicking her out on the curb so to speak. 

Here‚Äôs some background:

* She has been on disability and SSI her entire life and currently receives about $800/month in benefits.
* She has no work experience and has never held a job.
* She is 60 years old and has health conditions, including cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, which further complicate her ability to work. 
* She has not yet applied for food stamps or other assistance programs, and I‚Äôm unsure of her eligibility or the best way to navigate these systems in the state.
* She has no savings.
* She was looking at trailers to purchase but the high interest rates and cost far exceeds her income. 

I recommended public housing as a potential solution, as this was something we relied on during my childhood when she raised me and my sister with the same income. However, I don‚Äôt know how feasible, affordable or accessible that option is now. I also suggested she consider looking for work, but she is very resistant to the idea due to her health and lack of experience.

To be transparent, my relationship with my mother is complicated to say the least, and while I want to help her, I cannot provide financial support or a long-term living arrangement due to our past history. I‚Äôve told her that if she stays with me temporarily, it will be limited to 90 days and I would make her sign documentation and an agreement to be out after 90 days, as I am unable to take on the responsibility of supporting her indefinitely which I know would happen.

I am at a loss for how to help and would greatly appreciate any advice.

I racked up a credit card I got at 18 years old. Stupid, I know, and I've been paying $300-$400 a month for a couple years now, the account feels like it has hardly gone down. I don't use my credit cards anymore, but I have two with high interest rates. I also have a car loan with a high interest rate. Accounts are as follows, starting with the largest;

Credit Card 1. $15,700 owed left. 16% Interest, but I used it for Cash Advance a lot which is 20%. Monthly Mimimum is $350, I've been paying $400. (I've already paid over 2k in just interest this year)

Car Loan: $5,700 left. 18% APR. Monthly Payment is $190. I've been paying $200.

Credit Card 2. $900 left. 18% interest rate. I don't see a minimum on it, but I've been paying $100-$150.

As for assets, I have 22k in a retirement account compounding, but I haven't touched it and I don't want to. My dad told me I should use it, but I spoke to a free financial adviser awhile ago who told me not to, he said to pretend it doesn't exist. I'm in college, but I've been going to community college so my classes only cost $100 each + books and a few fees. I've been able to pay out of pocket for these classes.

I have no savings, I've been living paycheck to paycheck with my part time job, about $2,000 a month. I basically pay room rent and bills, and the rest goes to medicine for my dog and food for us.

I don't know the best way to use the money, I am doing better. I don't make impulse purchases anymore, I stopped online shopping, I only go to the shop when I absolutely have to, I buy necessities rather than wants. I even cut up my physical credit cards and froze them online. I feel very hopeful that I might finally be able to get out of this dark tunnel of debt. Talk about an expensive lesson!

personalfinance,is the tax on pulling money out of brokerage acct and roth ira the same ?,"idk a lot about finance, all i know is stick a decent chunk of money in something stable and never touch it. 

before this year i had tens of thousands of dollars sitting in a regular savings account, out of my adhd boredom i started watching all these finance videos and learned that i had been missing out on basically free money for years. 

I‚Äôm not that smart and i can barely make heads or tails out of how complex everything seemed so i gave up on trying to figure out and just started experimenting. 

i put half my money is a HYSA with amex, i left some money in my regular saving account for if i need instant access, i put some money in bitcoin, ethereum and solana, i invested some in a roth ira and invested some in a brokerage account. 

I was thinking of putting more in my brokerage account but i‚Äôm wondering if i might as well put it in my roth ira. I am 22 im not big on saving and i think its stupid when people tell 22 year olds to stick half of their money in an ira like tbh i don‚Äôt care if im rich when im 70 for lack of better or more mature phrasing i want to buy cool stuff now and enjoy my life as much as responsibly possible. As of now my priority is not to save, I only put my leftover money into savings. I might wake up tomorrow and want to buy a new car or i might not, point being I don‚Äôt have any goals as far as purchases i want to make or money i want to save. 

Which brings me to my question. I figure that on the chance that i don‚Äôt decide to make any huge purchases then its better to have the money in my roth ira than a brokerage account, but if i do decide to take the money out does it make a difference in whether it was in a roth ira or brokerage account in terms of the tax or fees i would have have to pay on my gains ? Is it that the brokerage account only taxes gains and the ira taxes the full amount withdrawn? or are the both taxed on the gains only

My plan is below, but I'm open to hearing from you all!

Basic details about our situation:

* Gross income is $210,000
* Loan on new home is $664,000. 30 years at 7.1% and monthly mortgage is $4,473. If rates go down in 12-24 months, we'll refinance.
* We have about $100,000 saved for retirement.
* We have two kids in the home with us, ages 16 and 5.

**Baby Step 4 - Save 15% for Retirement**

We currently are saving about 19% of our gross income toward retirement. These are our monthly contributions. The plan below allows us to max out employer matching and Roth, outside of my wife's contributions because she does not receive any employer match. Anything different we should be doing here, perhaps taking my wife's $250 and putting it toward a college fund?

* $834 that I contribute through my employer's plan
* $1,007 contributed by my employer to that same plan
* $250 that my wife contributes
* $1,166 that we contribute to our Roth IRA

**Baby Step 5 - Save for College**

I work in higher education, so it's completely possible that one or both of our children can benefit from tuition remission down the road. Our first daughter did this, and when I left for a different institution, the three of us were able to bankroll her tuition. As we're new to this stage, we are open to recommendations here.

**Baby Step 6 - Pay Off Home**

As mentioned, our monthly mortgage is currently $4,473. We plan to pay an even $5,000. Online calculations show that doing so will allow us to pay the home off 8 years early, even if we never refinance. I do wonder if putting that additional $527/month toward college would be more beneficial. If so, would there be a split that makes more sense to benefit our oldest, as he is 2.5 years from starting college and pour more into our youngest's account when he is done.",1732042654.0

personalfinance,Open enrollment has begun at work. Questions about retirement and HSA specifically.,"My work has open enrollment for 2025 benefits now. I'm staff at a public community college, so we get health insurance, a 457, 401k, an HSA, and a pension. Trying to figure out what's best for me--I'm 27, single, and only intend to stay here another 2 years maximum.

**General info:**

* I make $22.04 an hour pre-tax and work 40 hours per week. We are paid bi-weekly, so 26 paychecks a year. My pre-tax paychecks are $1,763.20. Post-tax I get $1,170.17. Rent is $615 and utilities are $120.
* Federal and state income tax is about $300, union dues are about $37, my health insurance is about $78 (premium + HSA contribution), 457 contribution is about $70, and my pension contribution is about $110. 

**Health insurance:**

* The premium (once per paycheck, paid bi-weekly) for 2024 was $15, and it's $33 for 2025. Not a huge jump, but still. The deductible is now $1,650, co-insurance is $650, and the maximum out of pocket is $2,300.
* My employer contributes $825 to my HSA, which leaves me with $3,475 left to contribute in the year. Divided per paycheck, that's about $133.65 per paycheck. This is a lot. I'm currently contributing $63--this will get me just past the maximum out of pocket by the end of the year. I felt it was the safest minimum amount to contribute.

**Retirement:**

* I have a 457 that I contribute to (always 100% vested) and a 401k that my employer contributes to. The sheet shows a 2% contribution by me for savings, and a 1% match by my employer; then a 2% contribution by me for PHF, and a 2% match by my employer. I don't fully understand the division since the 457 and 401k are not divided into savings and private health fund.
   * I'm currently contributing 4% to my 457 assuming I receive a 3% match from my employer.
* I also contribute 6.2% for my pension with a 6.2% employer match.

**Other:**

* I also have a Roth IRA and HYSA that I contribute to when I can, even if it's just a tiny bit. Usually, I dump as much as I can into the Roth from my savings at the beginning of the year, and then just contribute to my savings as the year goes on.

**Questions:**

* Should I prioritize maximizing my HSA contributions? I've heard this is the best thing to do before contributing to a Roth IRA, but I don't make a ton of money as-is.
* Which retirement elections should I prioritize? I've heard HSA, then 401k/457, then Roth IRA. Just want to make sure that tends to be correct.
* If I leave this job, will my HSA go with me or will I be forced to transfer it to my 457 or forfeit/withdraw it and take the penalty? I suspect this is a question for the bank that holds my HSA, just wondering if there's a standard practice.",1732041836.0
personalfinance,best credit card-type option for a family member who falls for scams?,"Hi. I have an aging family member (approaching 80yo) who seems utterly incapable of not falling for a scam -- constantly giving people her credit card info for faux virus protection, or answering deceptive texts that solicit money. Thankfully most of these have been caught by credit card fraud alerts -- though we've had to repeatedly cancel and get new cards for her.

Short of taking away her phone entirely and isolating her from those remaining loved ones who she does keep in touch with over the phone, I'm looking for ways to limit her downside risk with these scammers. 

My family and I have been considering removing any traditional credit cards from her possession and perhaps giving her prepaid cards to deal with day-to-day expenses. She's still very autonomous and likes it that way... and there's only so much babysitting we can do of her, and we're already spread thin.

We've frozen her credit so everything is flagged each time, thankfully.

personalfinance,Lost $7k in My Rollover IRA Due to Vanguard‚Äôs Mistake,"I‚Äôm trying to do a backdoor Roth IRA, but ran into some issues. I had too much income to contribute directly to a Roth, so I recharacterized it to a traditional IRA. The next step is converting it to Roth, but I need to make sure my Vanguard rollover IRA has a $0 balance by year-end (I have 1,225 shares of VTSAX).

I called Vanguard to confirm the price, and they said it would be yesterday‚Äôs price. That was wrong, which I discovered later after checking with others. I tried to cancel the transaction, but couldn‚Äôt. I sold the shares at $136, missing out on about $6-7k in potential gains. I‚Äôve learned that you don‚Äôt know the final price of selling mutual funds until after the sale.

Vanguard admitted the mistake and said they‚Äôll fix it, but there‚Äôs an issue. I already rolled over the funds to Fidelity for 167k, and now the balance is $166k due to market downtrun. Didn't think they'll take responsibility with this. Vanguard will adjust as soon as the money reaches my account (so I'll have 1225 VTSAX again, as if the transaction never happened).

The process:

* Vanguard tried to stop the check on Friday, but it was already cashed by Fidelity. Now my balance is $166k. This steps fails.
* Vanguard will ask Fidelity to return the money. I don‚Äôt know how long that‚Äôll take. They said it'll take 3 business days to just prep the letter.
* If above doesn't work, they'll go with reimbursement. I don't know what what this means.

If all of above doesn‚Äôt work, Vanguard will make an adjustment for the difference. I asked them to just give me adjustment, but they refused unless I go through all of the process. I asked them to speak with supervisor, but need to wait 48 hours. 

My questions:

* Should I leave the money in Fidelity and proceed with the Roth conversion?
* Should I wait for the process to finish, even if it risks missing the Roth conversion and paying taxes on the $7k roth contribution?

This is money I won‚Äôt need for 20 years.",1732039962.0
personalfinance,Sell off Stock Portfolio to Avoid Taking Out Student Loans ,I'll start with some background on my situation. I'm currently 25 years old in my first year of law school and I do not currently have a paying job. Going forward most of my tuition is covered by a scholarship and the remaining tuition that I have to pay is set aside. I have enough to cover tuition for my remaining semesters without taking out any loans so that is not an issue. Living expenses is another story. This year I was able to support myself with the money I had previously made at my last job but that will run out around the end of next semester (May). I have about 15000 in a stock account and I'm considering using that money to get me through living expenses for the second year of law school. That plus a stipend that I can likely get for a summer job should be able to cover my 2nd year then I will likely have to take out a loan once I hit third year no matter what. I'm wondering if it would be smart to sell off that portfolio to avoid taking out loans and racking up interest for at least another year. This stock portfolio was just meant to be a short - medium term investment and I still have a 401K that will not be touched under any circumstances. I'm looking to get some advice on what the best move is here? ,1732039722.0
personalfinance,Advice on what to do with $45K,"Hello, im trying to figure out the best plan for some additional income I've gotten from stock awards at my job. I personally like to sell when my stocks vest immediately and then reinvest in some blended stock such as ETFs, or use the money to work on my house which is a fixer upper. But I currently have:
- an emergency fund built up
- all my debts are paid off except for my mortgage (which is 6.75% with PMI, I just purchased about a year ago but I've been putting an extra $800 a month to attack principal) 
- no kids, no marriage, 26 year old

- I plan on contributing the max for a backdoor Roth later in the tax season
- I have about $24K invested in Robinhood primarily across a few ETFs and a handful of individual stocks, mostly tech heavy.

personalfinance,PERA Refund to payoff Debt?,"I worked in Colorado for the State for about 2 years during 2019-2021. I have just under $10k in a DB PERA account that has been sitting there since I left in 2021, untouched. 

Since then, I have stable contract work that leaves me with around $4800/month gross (I have to withhold the tax from each paycheck myself, I put ~20-25% of each paycheck in a HYSA for taxes). The pay is not great and I am struggling with my debt payments. My emergency fund was siphoned to pay for some unexpected medical bills. I recently committed to a budget that should keep me above water, but to be honest I have pathetic discipline and constantly find myself falling back into overspending and debt. Over the past 3 months, I have stuck to the budget and hope to continue to do so, but my CC debt is crushing.

I have about $6000 in CC debt at 26% that has been drowning me. I‚Äôve stopped charging anything to this card and frozen it, but the interest has been continuing to raise the balance.

I‚Äôm wondering how catastrophic of an idea it is to refund my PERA funds and pay off the CC debt and get the cloud out from over my head. I understand how terrible it is to use my future to finance my present, but the stress over these payments and having that balance continue to grow while I can‚Äôt make meaningful dents into it has been very hard to shake. I understand that I will have to pay income tax and an additional 10% tax on an early withdrawal so that $9800 I have would likely be somewhere around $6000 or so. 

At my current point in life, having that money seems like a life rope to get off a sinking ship. Of course I recognize that without commitment to changing my lifestyle and spending habits, i‚Äôll soon be in the same position but without $10,000 for retirement. I just can‚Äôt figure out what to do.

The other option would be to pull it out and roll over to an IRA and invest with those funds, but I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to do that either without incurring tax penalties.

Any advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated, even though I know /r/personalfinance might seppuku before suggesting that someone early withdraw retirement funds haha.",1732038554.0

My wife is a full-time student and doesn‚Äôt currently work.

I take home $640 a week with my current job.

personalfinance,Is it possible to have a conversation on the Roth vs Trad IRA question?,"I am long retired and worked before Roth IRAs were a thing and am a bit surprised by the love of the Roth over the traditional IRA here.    It seems to me to be a math problem.    Higher tax rates while working means use the deduction and lower tax rates in retirement means take advantage of the lower tax burden.   Yes there are RMDs but that is why you are investing for retirement to use that money when you are no longer working.

My career started out like yours I imagine.  Low 20% incremental tax rate, but as I got older I was able to make iit to higher brackets and lived in a state with state income tax, so typically paid an incremental tax rate in the upper 20% and occasionally lower 30%.

Now, my aunt's loan officer is pressuring my dad to refinance the mortgage because they just closed on a property. The issue is that my uncle, who‚Äôs still on the loan, has too much debt to close on his own property, so they‚Äôre asking my dad to refinance to remove my uncle from the mortgage.

The remaining loan balance on the house is $60K, with only 5 years left to pay it off. The loan officer is offering a 7.8% interest rate, which I think is too high.

personalfinance,Transferring both a roth and traditional 401k into matching IRAs - how do I avoid pro rata rule violations?,"Hey everyone.

I have been offered a new job that I am strongly considering taking.

With my current employer, I have both a traditional 401k as well as a roth 401k.

The new employer will offer a 403b, I'm not sure whether it is a traditional, roth, or both. 

I also maintain a POST TAX traditional IRA I have historically used *only* for serving as an account for performing a backdoor roth. I also, of course, have a roth ira. This is because of the sunsetting provisions and my pay being somewhat bursty, it was easier to contribute the max amount of POST TAX dollars into the traditional on jan 2nd, then once the funds had cleared, convert it all to roth. 

I think my plan is currently as follows:

1. Open a new traditional IRA that is set up for pre-tax dollars.
2. Perform a rollover of my roth 401k into the roth IRA.
3. Perform a rollover of my traditional 401k into the pre-tax traditional IRA.
4. In the new year once the dust has settled and jobs have been changed, I will invest into the roth IRA directly since I won't be earning enough to worry about sunset anymore.

I am specifically looking to avoid transferring my 401ks into the 403b as most educational services locally use extremely high cost 403b providers (equitable) and I don't really want to be paying 1-2% on my investments when I could be paying a much lower rate at vanguard where my IRAs are located.

The new position will not be earning as much as the old one, and so I believe I can avoid doing the backdoor roth IRA into the future.

Does this all make sense? I know rolling the 401k into the ira can trigger pro rata issues so I just want to get some eyes on this to make sure it all makes sense.",1732028530.0

We had state farm for years, but it was abruptly canceled when they learned it was a work-live (even though we had 10+ instances of documentation stating it was a work live including day one paperwork, but I digress), and now have a local bigger insurance who was fine the first year (zero claims), but then raised premiums by a thousand dollars which is a lot for a small business.

Or do I help my partner with their debt?","Hi there, I'm not used to posting on Reddit so forgive me if I worded any of this poorly Z\_Z.

  
So I'm (31) a small business owner in the creative/artistic/performance industry (technically a sole proprietor w/o an LLC if it matters), and things have gone really well for me. I'm saving thousands of dollars almost every month, mostly in hopes of buying a house one day. Up until last year, I've been pretty poor, so this is a new development for me, and one I have no idea what to do with (a good problem to have, though, admittedly). 

I figured at this rate I was going to be able afford a house sooner than later, so I've just kept it uh, is liquid the right term? in savings accounts with 3.5-5% APY, but now that I've saved up over 60k that way (and my partner is no longer in a financial position to help fund a house--most of which are fairly expensive here in the Denver market), I just feel like I should be doing something \*more\* with it while we wait/I save as it could be anywhere from 1 to 5 years. I also don't need to save up a down payment that large even if I wanted to keep a large sum of money handy. 

Seeing as I'm a freelancer and have always been a freelancer with no 401K, SS, etc, I've been advised to put the maximum allotment into a Roth IRA, but that's kind of about all the advice I've gotten. I've also been considering helping my partner out with their debt since that'll ultimately be a consideration that affects our loan options (and them paying 20%+ on interest is definitively worse than me earning an extra 5-10% through investments, or so I assume). Of course if I did do that, rest assured there would be a contract of some form of fashion. (I love them to pieces, but I'm careful with my money because I remember what it's like to work a lot harder for a lot less). And I have no debt to pay down personally. Other than that I already have about 35k in other savings/investments from previous years, not including the 60k+ figure above. (As a freelancer, I really just try to 'over-save' as much as possible haha. No health insurance, no retirement accounts, etc. Just seems really important to do I guess.)

What do you all recommend for me to best setup my financial future and/or house buying prospects? Preferably something that's really simple/easy to manage and/or access. I'm the type of person who hates having more than one credit card, bank account, and prefers to use apps for ease and accessibility of use (for instance, I have an Acorns account, and considered looking into Roots, at one point I invested into Crypto--good and bad that haha), but I'm definitely willing to hear out more complicated options if they're significantly better. I'll likely help my partner with some if not all of their non-student loan debt (16k on CC, 12k on a car), but I could technically wipe all of that and still have money leftover. (Which feels like a really crazy thing to say??? I literally cannot overstate how much I've never been in this position before.) So where else should it go?

The car equity was to pay for my wife's medical bills (we are in Canada) but her meds are not covered by my insurance plan and I had to pay out of pocket. She doesn't work because she is unable to due to her extreme health condition. I went to every payday loan that would offer me short term cash cause I had nowhere else to go. I paid over the loan. But this last month I got hit with all the payday loans. It erased my income and I NSF'd  -$800.00. this includes my consumer proposal which MUST BE PAID. I couldn't pay- my credit is 400 and my insurance just canceled me off the plan. Apparently they have a 15 day cancellation of no payment. I am in debt now effectively $3000. This doesn't sound like much to sum, but I have absolutely nowhere to go. My family wants to be repaid, my friends wants to be repaid. And I have -299 in my bank account from the consumer proposal.

personalfinance,Evaluating whether I should enter an employment program or not,"Just last year I went from being legally blind and having 95% of my visual acuity in my remaining eye to losing most of my central vision. I'm in my mid 20s and several years back I moved from Virginia to the Deep South after graduating college. Truthfully I've never found my footing career-wise. It's been floated to me that I should join the Blind Enterprise Program, which offers disabled people in my situation the opportunity to (effectively) operate food service and micro-retail businesses, think vending machines in government offices and state prisons. While I may prefer to become a teacher, the licensing procedure in my state takes four years on top of a Bachelor's degree, while this program takes about 20 weeks. Thinking long-term, I'd definitely not mind becoming a teacher.. but the time to get a licnese feels like a hindrance.  I have 3 years of experience in purchasing and am finding it difficult to get hired on by a company, so I see this as something to do for the next 4-5 years that can help me live on my own.

While I am going off of limited data, gross income for sites I have seen ranges from 60-90k/annum, net proceeds are about 1/2 to 1/3rd. Top-line national figures suggest the average is around 50k/yr. In a purely mathematical sense, it seems like a good idea.

 There are a few issues I can see arising:

1) Getting over the stigma of this not being a ""side hustle"" but, you know, basically a full time job. It's low-skilled gig work with a lot of government bureaucracy involved. I'm paraphrasing from some book, but ""it's hard to see a potential path out if you're stuck in a room without much opportunity"".

2) While startup costs are minimal, most locations I've heard of are located outside of my county and in general far from civilization (think a prison commissary). Logistically, I don't know how you service those without spending 4 hours in a car simply driving to the location 2 days each week. That's not feasible for most people even hired drivers.

3) Looming issues around tariffs. i previously worked in hospitality purchasing through COVID, I remember the whiplash of supply chain issues and it almost gave me a stomach ulcer. Rising costs way beyond projections and literally no way not to spend the money, the margins and top-line figures seem a bit too optimistic.",1732011282.0
personalfinance,Question about Charge Off and Settlement,"Hello!

Background:  I was self-employed and had a personal loan and credit card through Navy Federal that I defaulted on back in 2021 .. COVID didn't help either. So anyway, I went to apply for a mortgage recently and this negative mark on my credit is hurting me.  I have a few missed credit card payments from a few years ago, but other than those I have been steadily rebuilding my credit and it is rising (around 570 now). Navy Federal has this listed as a ""Charge Off"" on my report, and it just hit my credit report in Sept 2024.

 I contacted Navy Federal to get information about this and they said they are having a third party collect the debt (Apelles, LLC which is a collections agency). I contacted Apelles and they said I can either pay the total debt in full (around $26k) or they will settle with me and I will have to pay $8900 (I looked back through emails from Navy Fed and this is the settlement amount they gave me also, but I was stupid and ignored it). They said they are handling the payment, and once I pay it then they will give to NFCU and then the debt on my credit report will be updated to ""Settled"" and it will no longer be listed as a ""Charge Off"". Apelles also said they will provide me with a letter stating the debt has been settled and they are no longer seeking payment, which I can give to my lender.

My Dilemma: My mortgage lender stated that since Navy Federal has this debt listed as a ""Charge Off"", means they are no longer attempting to collect the debt and they essentially wrote it off and I should receive a 1099 (to essentially report it as income, but I haven't received one). He suggested that I write a letter to NFCU and Apelles to dispute the debt and state that they are reporting this debt incorrectly and that I do not owe it (since it was charged off) according to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. However, when I spoke to Navy Federal, they said they have not charged it off and they are still seeking payment but using a third party to collect payment.

I am confused by all of this, and honestly I want to correct this on my report so that I can move on, build my score again, and get a mortgage. I am able to pay the settlement for $8900. This is the only thing that is weighing me down. I am much more responsible with my spending and I pay my cards in full every month.

What do I do? Any advice is much appreciated! Thank you!",1732010754.0

personalfinance,Do I sell my condo or rent the extra bedroom?¬†,"Hi All,

Struggling with a decision I need to make in the next 24 hours (saying yes/no to a potential roommate).

I bought a condo back in 2022 (I've owned for exactly 2 years) in Southern California. Put 20% down, have a high mortgage payment due to interest rates at the time (and still have not fallen).

My industry also went on strike and I lost a LOT of work I thought I was going to have, and it all sort of ran dry. I can cover about half my expenses now with my limited income, and have about a year and a half of savings left.

It's been so hard to find a decent job and I'm going crazy seeing my savings drain. My condo is a 2-BR and I'm considering renting out the extra room which would cover about 1/3 of my mortgage payment. Definitely helps.

But, I don't want a roommate. This would be an easier situation if I was renting and could just move/downgrade, but I own like a big boy now. I was browsing ads for rentals and seeing prices for about 1/2 to 2/3rds my mortgage price in a great area and am drooling a bit. But if I were to sell ALREADY, would all the costs make this whole buying decision I made not worth it? Do I bite the bullet and get a roommate?

If I sold, I'd have access to a good amount of equity that I could rent with and invest in other areas while I continue looking for work. But then I miss the boat on owning. I'm a single male, and this isn't my dream home, it was meant to function more as an investment.

Do I drive myself crazy with a roommate just to keep my condo, or drive myself crazy seeing my savings drain a lot faster? That's where I feel stuck -- what's the price for the peace of mind of living alone?

What would you do? Thanks for reading!

EDIT: Some financial info:

Current mortgage: $4,000/mo.

Roommate portion would be: $1,500/mo.

Rent for a 2-br place I'd live in: $2,600/mo. (so the price would be about even for me, except no roommate and no owning).

I have about $80,000 in savings, and $225K-$250K in equity. Obviously subtract closing costs but most of that I'd be able to invest.

On top of that I have $28K in federal loans which I've stopped working on since the strike/lack of work...",1732005713.0

Right now she wants to start building her credit to get a small car loan in the future.

In researching guides on Reddit and elsewhere it was recommended she apply for a secured credit card. She recently did and was accepted. Are there best practices in how she utilizes the card? As in how much of her limit she uses at a time? I read that using 30% of a credit card limit is preferred. Any truth to that?

Would it be smart for her to also apply for other credit sources? Perhaps a really small personal loan she can easily pay off in a short period of time? Or would that have a negative effect on her credit score?

I‚Äôm so afraid of getting scammed or tanking my credit, but I also cannot afford to be almost over drafting every month. 

I have a budget I‚Äôm sticking to, and have stopped using my cards. But beyond that I have NO IDEA where to start in terms of consolidating. I am a teacher and make close to 100K a year, and heard I could take a loan out on my retirement, and I also have a very small 401k from before I became a teacher and got a pension. I ignore it because I don‚Äôt understand how 401ks work. I also hear of people getting loans through credit unions but I don‚Äôt really know what any of this means if I‚Äôm being honest. So here are my questions:

 1) after sticking to a budget, where does one start?
2) I am obviously an idiot when it comes to personal finance. Are there people whose jobs it is to help low to middle class people figure out their finances?? OR, related - how do I learn more about this stuff (including smartly investing)? I feel like every Google search brings me to disreputable places and it‚Äôs hard to figure out what‚Äôs legit 
3) if anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you get out?

personalfinance,Just Got Married - Need Some Advice,"People of reddit--my wife and I just got married!

We're going through the process of combining our finances and wanted to reach out to seek some guidance.

We need the following:

* Checking account to receive paychecks, pay credit cards, and hold no more than $5k in...our biggest need is for access to international ATMs at low / no fees as we travel a lot
   * Currently holding 2 credit cards - AmEx Plat & Chase Sapphire Reserve, will likely consolidate as it feels like a lot to have both at the same time
* Investment account for the vast majority of our money - brokerage, retirement, and money market accounts --> managed quarterly / monthly at most

Any reccomendations for easy personal finance stacks we could build on?

Current thought is to open checking account with Schwab because of free international ATMs and no minimum funding requirement and managing our investments in Vanguard.

personalfinance,"Best, low risk, place to park life insurance payout.","We put a life insurance payout into a 6 month CD (6 months ago) since we didn't have the headspace to make a plan for it. 

Now that its matured an edward jones employee contacted us and said we should put it back in a 6 month CD at 4.2%, or into a money market account (no FDIC insurance.)

Nearly 100% of my savings have been put into index funds or stocks so keeping this money lower risk seems smart. We will max out Roth IRA contributions this year regardless.

We do not need liquidity, but it seems like locking it away in a CD, or putting it slightly more at risk in a money market account are both worse options than a high yield savings account. We also just took out a HELOC loan at 7.2%, going up to 8.5% that is about 1/6th of the life insurance payout. I am hoping to pay that back aggressively out of income, hoping to have a job starting in January, but thats a bunch of hoping. 

Is the CD smart because rates are about to drop a lot?

Is there someplace that gives a bonus payout or startup payout for moving 6 figures in?

Is paying off the HELOC the smartest move since 8ish% is higher than 4ish%?

Are there smart questions im not asking? 

I have read the general guide, but think this is worth asking since we largely have the basics covered and im thinking more about maximizing low risk interest rate options.

I currently make $3400 monthly that will be cut to $3000 in January.

My concern is that my dog needs surgery and I will be paying between $6000-$8000, so I will likely need to take a loan to pay for it. The surgery is completely non negotiatable for me.

My options are:

1) Use my entire savings to pay for as much of the surgery as possible.

2) Pay off my car and use the remainder of my savings to pay as much of the surgery as possible and take a loan for the rest.

3) Don't pay off the car, pay half the surgery, and take a loan for the remainder.

I'm leaning very heavily to number 3. I'm very hesitant to drain my savings, especially since I will be needing to move out in February and need the money as a security deposit. Absolute worst case scenario is that I need to stay where I am. I am only moving because I hate my neighbors (shouting as I typing this). Not to mention that I will not be able to build my savings again very quickly leaving me feeling vulnerable.

I can possibly slash my expenses down to the absolute bare minimum along with doing 10-20hrs overtime weekly, however I will likely also be draining my mental health severely by doing so and now is not a good time with other things going on in my life, not least of which my injured dog.

Any advice or insight is appreciated. I'm likely going to just have to tough out the overtime but I still want to consider any options.

personalfinance,I‚Äôve Screwed Myself Over,"Long story short, this year has been horrendous. My dad died, my grandma died, my cat died, my SIL has cancer, my income dropped, one roommate moved for work and just stopped paying, and another I had to kick out because it was not good, and I was being taken advantage of (trying to help a friend who needed a place). I have fallen so behind on my bills, and I‚Äôm just not sure what else to do. I have a decent income (~$100k) but I‚Äôm so late on my payments that it seems impossible to catch up. I‚Äôm current on my mortgage, HOA, and utilities. I‚Äôm behind on all debt payments (which total $64k‚Äîabout $3k behind). I had already worked out hardship plans but still can‚Äôt afford those. I have two side hustles but have been so depressed that I haven‚Äôt been able to motivate myself to work on them‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already ruined my credit‚Ä¶ it was 843 and now it‚Äôs 476. Should I try to catch up or declare bankruptcy? Do I have any other options? 

Edited with numbers:
Monthly take home pay, after 22% is taken out for my pension, which is the minimum I can have taken out: $5,406, but I‚Äôve lost about $1,500 a month for 5/7 of the last months
Mortgage/Home Ins./Property Tax: $2,806 (rent is about $300-400 a month cheaper where I live if I were to sell and stay in same area, one of the cheapest where I live)
HOA: $109
Power: $102
Water: $60
Internet: $80

Car Ins. $145
Gas: $90
Monthly Subscriptions: $18
Groceries/Housewares: $350
Eating Out: $350
Pets: $100
Misc: $100 (hair cut, makeup, feminine products, clothes, etc)
Roth: $400 (on pause currently) 

It doesn‚Äôt look scary until you factor in that I have missed pay significantly more than usual this year due to everything going on in my life, so you can see how I got behind on credit cards. 

Here are my debts:
Credit Cards: $52,000, minimums: $1,300, interest: 6-10% (I‚Äôve negotiated this twice)
Personal Loan: $9,000, minimum: $330, interest: 8%

I‚Äôm 3 months behind in a week, so about $5,000. More than I thought üò©

As far as family goes, I don‚Äôt have any help or support. My dad had a will, according to what he told me the night before he passed, but when I ask my step mom about it she won‚Äôt answer me and literally changes the subject (I finally asked if he left me literally anything‚Äîeven just a tshirt or a massage gun, and she still avoids answering). It‚Äôs on my list to call a probate attorney, but I literally have no clue what the deal is. It‚Äôs hard to imagine he didn‚Äôt leave me anything; he and I were super close, and he was a surgeon, but my step mom is‚Ä¶ interesting? She and her sister are still fighting over their mom‚Äôs will, and her mom passed 5 years ago. I don‚Äôt really know anything beyond that. The lawyers I‚Äôve talked to all said I can write a note to include in my file if I declare bankruptcy. 

I am usually really good with money and super motivated. I worked 3 jobs for 12 years to pay off student loans and then saved another $85k to buy a house on a conventional loan in a high cost of living state to be close to my family. Prior to this happening, I had never had an overdraft on my bank account and never paid a bill late. I know how to get out of debt, but I guess I just don‚Äôt know what else to do to get caught back up. I‚Äôm burnt out and depressed (don‚Äôt worry too much‚ÄîI have multiple degrees in this area and know what I need to do). I‚Äôll get there, but I‚Äôm thick in the grief process right now, and this isn‚Äôt helping. I had a 3 month emergency fund, but I ended up going through that when I was roommateless. I would prefer NOT to rent out my spare bedroom. I have had the worst experiences this year.

I have talked to my financial planners, and they recommend bankruptcy if I can qualify for a chapter 7. I would keep my house and car according to laws in my state. I don‚Äôt anticipate needing credit for anything in the near future as I already have a house and reliable vehicle; honestly, at this point, I think my credit would be fixed faster if I did either form of bankruptcy. At least bankruptcy would restructure everything and get me caught up. I obviously am torn about doing this since I keep delaying it and trying to figure out another way‚Äîincluding here. I feel like such a failure.

ANOTHER EDIT: I COULD pull $5k from my Roth IRA to catch up and take the tax hit (I got a big refund last year). Ugh. IDK!

Married 17 years. We've contributed to my retirement SEP IRAs, but she has a school counselor job which will not bear fruit in retirement (came to it late).

We have about $950k in various IRAs. We have a house we paid $239k in 2007 at top of the market. I have a previous house that is a rental worth about $165k. We owe about $225 total on both houses. I make about $201k/year, plus $25k-40k extra by working my vacation time. She makes about $60k.

Question/opinions comparing which is more beneficial for us and current family situation. My husband‚Äôs adult son (currently in college) moved in with us full time this past January 2024. He use to be split 50/50 with his mother. My husband and his mom would alternate the child tax credit each year as well. Last year was my husband‚Äôs turn to claim for 2023 tax year, however the mother was upset due to reportedly having several expenses that were not split and wanted to claim the tax credit. Husband wanted an itemized invoice in order to split those costs instead of giving up claiming the child on his taxes that year.

Fast forward to present day. Since the kid lives with us full time, I am not sure if fair to continue alternating child tax credits. I could be incorrect so feel free to point that out (nicely). The kid is on the mom/step-dad‚Äôs insurance though he also has healthcare through Native American Tribe. They also pay for his cell phone service. We cover his car insurance, gas money, and the regular increase in utilities/food when adding another person to a household.

How would I go about comparing the increase in our costs versus what we would gain or lose with the child tax credit? Thx for any info!

EDIT: My apologies for my major confusion! Step-son too old for child tax credit and both sets of parents (mom & step-dad OR dad & step-mom) aren't single so Head of Household doesn't seem to apply.

In other words, the merchant doesn't have the money and neither does the bank--the funds didn't even bounce once they reached the closed debit card.  Every time I contact the merchant, they tell me to contact the bank to return the funds.  Every time I contact the bank, they tell me to contact the merchant because they can't even file a dispute on funds that don't exist.  I am out of ideas on what else to do or who else to call; I'm expecting a call from merchant leadership in a few days to try and discuss the matter further, but does anyone have any idea on what I can do to get this sorted out?  I have copies of the bank statement showing that the funds didn't arrive, and I have a copy of the refund statement saying the funds were sent.  I just have no idea who I can hold responsible for this problem since everyone is pointing fingers, or what I can say to them to make someone take this seriously and figure out where the money went.

personalfinance,Advice on tricky situation,"I hope this makes sense because it‚Äôs a convoluted situation. 

A retired F recently got divorced and had her son buy her ex out of 43% of their home. The son got a mortgage at almost 50% of his income, is living in the home and she‚Äôs currently renting a unit from another son but is only paying 1/2 of the rent because she only makes 2k in SS a month. So the other son has to cover the rest. 

The first son wants his mom to do a buy back and sell him and his GF the rest of the house for a monthly payment for the next 15-20 years. They can‚Äôt afford to get a loan for the remainder of the house. So if she doesn‚Äôt agree they need to sell the house. 

A few of us think this situation is a terrible idea but it‚Äôs such an emotional situation that no one is listening to reason and the first son obviously is trying to do whatever he can to keep the house which is way more than they can afford. 

My questions are the following:

- would this make sense at all to keep the house?
- what problems do you see with such an arrangement? 
- what is the best way out of this?

I feel like I know what everyone is going to say but as I‚Äôm not a pro in real estate or finance I need more information to show them the pitfalls of this arrangement.

I recently took a position at a new job. They offer a 5% discount on employee stock purchase plan, with buys twice a year, no look back, and no holding period.

Both capped at 25% of income.

She wants to purchase a lower mileage 2008 Ford Taurus X that we found about 2 hours from us that I found online. However, the cost seems really high to me. The price was $9999, but the total tax, tag, and title the Sales Guy gave me was $11,789. 

We have a decent amount of cash on hand, thankfully, so we could buy a new or a used car, but my wife doesn't really like anything that isn't $60k+.

However, I‚Äôve noticed that this practice causes my credit score to fluctuate, as the credit bureaus observe my credit card debt increasing and then decreasing frequently.

For background, I am getting serious with my girlfriend and she has expressed that I should start taking my (soon to be our) personal finances more seriously. We were having a relationship logistics talk and when we get on the topic of finances she is typically not satisfied with how I manage them (I don't). I've basically lived on pure impulse and things mostly pan out. I don't educate myself much outside my work and personal interests and don't know where to begin to put a plan together. Listed below are some of the problem areas we have identified together.

1. Budget - Don't have one, don't need one. I know how much I have coming in every month and I just spend less than that. This has been my strategy since I turned 18 and I have never rethought it (Im 31). The surplus gets saved to a savings account. I have 3 months of all my expenses saved.

2. Investing - All dollars above the 3 months expenses get split in two. My good friend built a ""trade bot"" that tells him how to buy stocks. Not sure how it works, I'm not that kind of engineer, He built the bot and I fronted the money for him to test it. So far its done well? There is more in there than the sum of all my deposits so I assume thats good. She asked me how its doing against the market? She thinks the trade bot and the fact shes never met this friend are sketchy and wants me to put it in a ""normal"" investment account. The other half I use to buy project cars. As I hobby I purchase and restore old cars. I can perform a full frame off restoration including electrical, paint, uphostlery and engine work in my shop.  I keep the ones I like and sell the ones I dont have space for. I love it and if we are being honest it was unironically my only investment ""plan"" when I was single. Old Mercs and Bimmers turn a good profit if you are not paying for the labor.

3. House - I bought a house in Massachusetts some time ago and have been renting out for about 7 years now. Really not sure what to do next. Its managed by a property manager and I have not seen it since I left 7 years ago. I don't know what to do with it and she thinks I should know what to do with it?



I am not lazy and I do have the desire to figure out how to be financially literate. I just dont know where to start. It just has never been something I have thought about and I am woefully behind the power curve of understanding and have not lived the lifestyle. I still fundamentally do not believe I need a budget.

To be quick and to the point as I am on my way out -

I worked for an LLC for several years as an independent contractor (1099). I found out the final year that I have been misclassified as a 1099 the entirety of working there. I got testy with my ""job requirements"" and was fired. I have yet to receive a final owed paycheck. So far I have really only lightly researched potentially charging interest owed for the paycheck, as well as pursuing legal action towards the company to recoup funds for prior taxes. I also have began reaching out to Attorney's in my area.

This feels like such a daunting issue with a lot of unknowns on my part. I want to receive the most compensation I possibly can - as I owed thousands each year for taxes (didn't learn how to do my taxes efficiently until the final year either üôÑüòÖ), and I just feel generally pissed off about being treated like a W2 without the benefits.

Just a small side comment - I was the youngest contractor working for the company, working with people twice my age who also likely do not know they were/are being misclassified.... better learning all of this late, but not double my age late, is definitely a positive from my perspective.

I retired 2 years ago at 70 and sold my small business for 7 figures.  I hold a 4% note and am collecting 10% of gross revenue (around 100k per year), the bulk of which is categorized as LTCG.  

For reasons I won't go into, my IRA with Schwab was not funded over past 2 decades the way it should have been, so I am currently sitting on 'only' about $450K in that account.  I was too busy running the business and spending earnings to think about retirement and investment strategies (belatedly remedied by reading r/bogleheads etc.)  

About 8 years ago I took some investing 'play money' and bought quite a bit of TSLA.  That stock is in an after-tax investment account and is worth, as of today, right at $680,000. 

My quandary is this:  How do I unwind from that single stock so I can move the money into bonds and index funds to pad my retirement income?  Clearly, holding such a large percentage of my net worth  ($2.8M) in a single stock is extremely risky.  Obviously, I could just bite the bullet and sell the bulk of the stock, either all at once or over months/years, but would pay 20% capital gains on the sale.  And that would also put me in a high tax bracket as well as affect things like social security IRMMA.

Was laid off from my job of 24 years, I was notified back in late Aug that I had 60 days to find a new job and then I would be laid off. I looked internally/externally during those 60 days and couldn't find anything (have applied for \~150 jobs) Was officially let go Nov 1st, and got 6 months severance + medical/dental/vision until May. So far I have had a handful of interviews, made it to final rounds of 1 role and didn't make it past that. I'm tired of looking, but I know I need to. This is the first time in my life that I haven't been working and so far it sucks. 

Wife is still working and we will use her open enrollment/qualified event to cover us on insurance after COBRA runs out. 

Should be getting unemployment soon which isn't much, but better than nothing.  ($450/week)

Own 2 houses, 1 is primary, the other is a vacation house we bought during covid, both 3.5% rate

Primary we owe about $500k, value is \~ $2.1- 2.3 million, vacation we owe $330k, value is \~$615-625k.

Trying to decide if we sell the secondary home or rent out, the second house is in a tourist area, and we have only ever used it as a vacation spot, but lately it's been to hard to get up to it. We could long term rent for or try the airbnb route and rent for more. 

I am overly invested in my company stock as I never really sold my RSUs/ESPP and they have a value of \~$1.85 million. I have a diversified 401k that is valued at \~$1.3 million that I need to move into a rollover IRA and will need to make some investment choices once it is rolled over. Also have 6-8 months expenses in HYSA. I also need to move most of my severance into something that makes a little money. 

Lost and don't know how to make sure what I do have will last us if I don't find something. 

My question is really, would I be stupid to sell 1/3 of my company stock and pay off my primary house if I can't find a new job in the next year? I know I could sell some to cover expenses over the next few years, along with our cash reserves, but something about being completely debt free puts my mind at ease.

personalfinance,Pay extra on Mortgage or HELOC?,"Hello,

We currently have a 20 year mortgage, with 17 years left to pay. Interest rate is 2.875%; balance is $158,000; payment is $1,000. (This does not include our taxes/insurance)

We have a HELOC with a $46,000 balance at 7.75%. We have interest only payments right now of about $300. 

We wanted to roll the HELOC into a new mortgage and refinance down to a 12 year mortgage to cut five years off our loan. Total payment would be about $2000 with a rate of 6.25%. However, I‚Äôm wondering if we should just pay extra on one of the loans because our current mortgage rate is so low. If we go this route, is it better to pay extra on the HELOC? Or our Mortgage? 

I‚Äôm hoping rates will come down next year, like everyone else of course. Maybe combine the two loans when/if rates ever get down to 4.5-5%.

Thoughts? 

ETA: I know, I sound dumb wanting to refi to a higher rate but liked the idea of combining the two to get them paid off in 12 years.  I thought with my HELOC being higher rate, maybe it would be a wash to combine them. But now that I say this all out loud, I realize how bad of an idea that would be. ",1731961562.0
personalfinance,Not very good with money - please opine on my plan...,"Hi All!  Thanks for taking the time to read.  I am interested in knowing the thoughts others who know more about money and depreciating assets.

I am recently retired and live alone in a 2020 year model RV.  I support myself with a pension I earned from the state, over the course of 35 years.  It is a modest pension; enough to barely cover my monthly expenses.

I chose this lifestyle (full-time RV living), because it best suits my needs at the present, and I need to have the ability to move locations on short notice.

The RV I am in now, I bought in 2021.  It's present worth is about $29,000 retail, and I have paid the loan down to $28,500.  APR is 7.19%.  I needed low monthly payments when I first financed, and am afraid that I am going to be upside down soon on this loan.  This RV also no longer fits my lifestyle and needs.  

My situation has changed and I have enough money to make some sweeping changes.   I want to purchase a ""new-to-me"" RV, which I will live in probably for another 4 or five years, after which time, I see myself settling down stationary.  

RVs I am looking at moving into run in the low to mid 40s ($41K to $46K).  Because I cannot sell my present RV without having a place to live, my thought is to pay off the loan on my current RV, thus avoiding the high monthly interest, purchase my new RV for cash, outright, move from the old RV into the new one, and then fix up and sell the old one.  While I will no longer be paying interest, the old RV will continue to depreciate in value while I own it, and there will be insurance and storage costs associated, until it sells.

Another concern is having $75K in cash tied up in two RVs.

So... opinions whether this is the best path for my situation, or should I buy the newer RV outright, and maintain payments on the loan on the old RV, until it sells and the loan can be satisfied.

personalfinance,Husband and I are $70k in debt (mostly credit cards) - how to get out of this mess? ,"Firstly, please be kind, I already have a lot on my plate, I dont want internet to make me feel even more crappy. Secondly, I am trying to gauge if I have exhausted all my options to fix this financial mess we are in.

I'd like to think I have a good understanding of budgeting/planning for finances etc. Regardless of the backstory of 70k debt, I am looking for ways to get out of this. I haven't been able to financially contribute too much in the last three years given I was pregnant and then on mat leave in Canada, which pays 55% of your salary. I also took that time to get my MBA, which further put us into debt.

Im done with th3 MBA and I now have a good job that pays well, my husband and I make roughly 18k month after taxes.

70k is mostly high interest creditcards. Other than debt relief, is there anything I can do to pay these down. LOC isn't an option since our credit isn't that great given our high debt, I am little lost.

  
Edit: I realized that I have given a very incomplete picture of my situation but what I was really looking for are the tips/tricks to pay this down quickly. Here is the context: we have dual citizenship, we had kids in Canada, so I could take advantage of one year long maternity leave for each of my kid, which I did. So, I was on 55% Canadian income for 2 years, we did put our expenses on the cards, which clearly has racked up now. I am now working in the US, and this money is earned in the US, our gross pay is actually $28k per month but our expenses are quite HIGH. 

Mortgage: $3900, Child care: $5500, Bills: $1200, Cars: $1800, Side business: $1500 all stated in USD, after all this, we are left with $4k per month, all of which will go to the creditcards but what I was really looking for was ways I can expediate the pay-off. 

  
And yes, the side hustle is costing money rightnow, hopefully it pays off.

personalfinance,Pulling SCRS PEBA Account Money for House Down Payment,"Hi all!

So I was a teacher a few years back and accured around $12k in the South Carolina Retirement System through PEBA. I know the general wisdom is to always rollover those savings into a 401k or IRA, but in this case, it could mean the difference between buying a home vs renting a year or two sooner and potentially being able to make a move when the market is more optimal. As I figure with the hefty tax penalties, I'd probably leave with $7.5k to $8k. This would allow us to put a down payment down while also still keeping our buffer savings (we have nearly 3 months of income each). We both make around $51k yearly and each have a car payment for the next 4 years of around $400 each. Currently paying $1400 in rent, but seeing that mortgages could be similar and would rather be paying to own a house so that money is going back to us instead of a landlord.

personalfinance,Saving for college or a future home and retirement?,"My kids are growing up fast and we have been investing on their behalf. I am looking down the road and it's clear that it is much easier to get a loan for college than a mortgage. Loans for college are also generally low interest. There shouldn't be a need to pay them off right away, and they can be deferred if the student is in a graduate program. That said, many families seek to pay tuition upfront or pay off the loans asap. 

I imagine my kids going to a 4 year college and following up with graduate school. This means that they wouldn't be in the job market until they are nearly 30 and they wouldn't need to start making payments on their loans until then. In the meantime, I can continue to invest on their behalf, growing their $15k accounts to $150k by that time. 

They will emerge on the job market with $150k that will help buffer their transition to work-life. They can buy a house - at least here in the Midwest - and start building equity asap. Sure, they will still have loan payments, and mortgage payments, but they will also have a nest egg that is growing at 8% interest that will compete against their 3% student loan. It will also allow me to keep principal in the market instead of the school's bank account. 

I'll have more money to help my kids out in their 30's and beyond. In the end, it seems like we should hold our money in the market as long as possible and let our kids pursue whatever education they want, preferably deferring payment while in graduate school so they can maximize their earnings in their professional life.

Hi, everyone.
I never thought I'd be in a position where I‚Äôd be asking strangers for advice, but here I am. Over the past two years, my life has completely unraveled, and I‚Äôm struggling to figure out how to pick up the pieces.

It all started during the pandemic. I was doing okay financially, working a steady job and saving little by little. But when the stock market dipped, I thought I saw an opportunity to grow my savings quickly. I went all in‚Äîeverything I had‚Äîon a few individual stocks, ignoring the warnings about diversification. At first, things looked promising, but as the market shifted, I realized too late that I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. I lost nearly my entire savings, around $25,000, which was everything I had worked for.

To make matters worse, my marriage began falling apart during this time. The financial stress, combined with other personal issues, became too much. My wife left and took our 5-year-old daughter with her. I don‚Äôt blame her‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt the person she married anymore.

I have been into personal finance for about 3 years now, but have more so been watching from the sidelines and learning since I haven‚Äôt had much income. With this being my first job I should now be able to actually invest consistently and am interested in recommendations on allocations given my goals.

I currently have about $9,000 in a brokerage $7,000 in my Roth, and $3,000 in an HYSA. My car is paid off and I have no debt.

I start my job next month and I‚Äôll make about $90,000 before taxes and deductions. The plan is to contribute 401k and HSA only up to max matching (3% salary and $400 for HSA).

After deductions and taxes I‚Äôll take home around $5,400 per month. I live with my mom and will pay half expenses so expenses will only come out to around $2,000 - $2,300 per month. 

$583 of my income after expenses will certainly go to my Roth so I can max it each year. However, how should I allocate the remaining ~ $2400? I do plan on building my HYSA to more than $3,000.

personalfinance,I‚Äôm an idiot who contributed to a tIRA while making more than the income limit. What should I do?,"I (32M) just paid off a ton of tax debt and was focused on maxing out my retirement accounts for the first time in my life.

I am covered by a retirement plan for the W-2 (CALSTRS, which is a 401(a) defined benefit plan where 10% of my W-2 paycheck is placed into a pretax retirement account).

Basically I'm about halfway through a loan for my car and it's worth about 4k with a payoff of 12k, got an insane interest rate when I got the car (26%) due to an old repo that has now been paid in full. all payments on time but principal hasn't moved and when I tried to talk to the bank they basically said my loan is setup to make me pay 100% of the interest before my principal moves at all. 
Car is 2013 Kia soul with engine recall and am super anxious about motor blowing up and me being completely fucked. (No GAP, I know it's horrible) What are my options with this loan? Really looking to get a new vehicle and it seems the ev tax credit can help with negative equity. Unfortunately credit score hasn't really changed since I got this loan. But my total debt has most definitely decreased by about 6-7k income is basically the same as when I got the car around 40-50k per year. Payment is 450 and am able and willing to have a higher payment. (700-800 is totally doable) No down payment money available. Possibly a consignor available. 
I know I got myself into this situation and I should probably just pray I can pay it off without it blowing up. Just looking for any other options/advice if any. Thanks!

personalfinance,To refinance or sell my car?,"So I have a loaded 2023 Tundra Limited that I bought in January of 23 with a 4 year loan and not that much down. My payments are $1223/month as I wanted to pay it off quickly. I did a budget before the purchase 2 years ago and it'd be tighter then my wife and I have run the budget before but we decided to go for it. Fast forward to nearly 2 years into the loan, I have $30,500 left on it, and the payments are causing issues with the household budget and are stressing the marriage. Value private sale is maybe $50,000 if I can find a buyer in this market. Trade in $48,000ish if I'm lucky. Carmax will give me $46,000 for it. 

If I refinance to a new 4 year loan from now it drops my payments for $1223 to $717 or so but the interest restarts. My CURRENT loan has a 5.49% rate and 2/3'rds of the interest is already paid. A new loan would probably be 6.5-6.79%. 

Alternatively I work more, get a 2nd job or just pick up hours at work. I work in an extremely taxing and stressful profession. My marriage is strained already for a couple reasons, finances being one, work stress (both of our jobs are very stressful), among other things. 

I'm not super keen on working more due to the stress that will put on me and the marriage but I need to figure something out as it was a BIG mistake to buy this years ago and the financial stress is really not good either. 

Do people think I should:

1. Refinance it? Saves paying Sales Tax again, pay a lot more interest. Drop payment by $500-ish for a 48 mo loan or $600 for a 60 month loan. I'd end up paying roughly $3500 more in interest then I'd pay just finishing out my current loan.

2. Trade it in for a cheaper vehicle? I could wheel and deal, trading it in keeps me from paying sales tax again. I could find something for a $500/mo payment or less ideally. 

3. Buckle down and work overtime like crazy to pay it off sooner? OR pick up a couple extra shifts a month to pay for the truck. It's not great either way, one way is 13 weeks of working 3 extra 12 hour shifts a week on top of my 3x12 hour regular shifts. I'd be a walking zombie as I'm already super tired and burnt out after 3x12's for a couple days, but it'd be paid off by next spring. This sounds terrible but I think the marriage would tolerate that better then a few extra shifts a month over the next 2 years which would prolong the fatigue and stress over a longer period of time. 

  
Sadly I do REALLY want a pickup truck, as my wife and I really like going out in to the wilderness to camp and it's super helpful with the dogs as well as for DIY home projects that we are both into but currently can't afford since the truck payment. The truck I have now has everything I'd ever want in one but I just should've done a 7 year loan and made extra payments OR just bought an old beater and not had a payment.

  
What does the collective think?

personalfinance,Preserving wealth while funding a large expense ,"My thought process with this plan stems from what I‚Äôve learned from wealthy people - Use other peoples money when you can (in this case the bank).

Quick run down on my scenario: me 38m, wife 32. Our combined income from day jobs $240k, rental income $36k year net, other income $100k yr. Assets - 401k $455k, IRA‚Äôs $246k, Brokerage $50k, crypto $332k, HYSA $80k.

We are planning a major home remodel next year that we‚Äôve budgeted $400k for. We have HELOC‚Äôs on our rentals to be able to cover this expense. My grand plan is to ride this current crypto wave and look to cash out the bulk of it around April of next year. Would transition crypto assets over to brokerage. Goal is to have $500k in brokerage invested in blue chip equities. Instead of paying for the remodel with cash / investments, I‚Äôd look to use the HELOC initially. Once I have my target amount in brokerage I‚Äôd sell covered calls off the portfolio to make monthly payments to the HELOC. Also would use our side income source to pay down the HELOC balance. Goal would be to have the full remodel cost paid off over a three year period. The whole purpose of this is to not deplete too much of our liquid assets, and benefit from the tax advantages with the heloc (tax write offs). 

Does this seem reasonable, or am I way off course here?",1731955352.0
personalfinance,Help: 401K vs. Saving for a House?,"**Question**: Is it irresponsible/unwise to **temporarily** lower HSA and 401K contributions to save for a house in my current situation?  I know the common advice to never touch this--is this a situation where it makes sense to do this?  Conservatively (i.e., not counting any bonuses) if I stopped contributing for 3 years, I would have as much saved as I wanted to have for down payment + reserved savings.  More likely (i.e., based on low-end of bonuses previously received) if I stopped contributing for 2 years, I would have as much as I wanted to have saved.  Add 2 years to each time estimate with no change to contributions.

**Sorry in advance for the long post...really just don't know what to do.  Any and all advice/experience is greatly appreciated.**

**Current Situation**:  In a HCOL area.  Max out HSA and 401K IRS contribution limits; save/invest 27-30% of monthly budget + all stock grants/bonuses; rent is 25% of monthly budget; student loans are 13% of monthly budget; car payment 7% of monthly budget.  ""Monthly budget"" = 2 paychecks, post-tax/withholdings/HSA/401K contributions, so there are 2 ""extra"" paychecks per year that are saved/invested/put towards student loans.  Stock grants and bonuses after taxes = about 18% of annual salary and are saved/invested/put towards student loans.  Don't carry a balance on credit cards. 

I support both myself and my spouse, who hasn't had success job hunting/hasn't had steady employment to reliably contribute to shared recurring expenses since getting an MBA.  Goal is to pay essentially all expenses with one salary (my salary for now or forever, tbd).  We want children in the next year, so  goal would be to save most of my spouse's future income/use it to pay for childcare, or if spouse is unemployed, they'll be the primary caregiver even though that's not exactly what we want/planned.

Like so many others, I've been saving but cost of the houses/areas we're interested in have run up faster than I could save over the past couple years.  Prices are starting to normalize a bit, but they're still quite high.  It seems that we won't be able to have an affordable monthly payment without putting at 20% down, given the interest rates and increasing home insurance costs (plus high property taxes in our area).  

Our apartment is well-priced, but the location is beginning to wear on us (me especially).  My new car has dents and scratches from other careless tenants parking crooked in the lot and hitting whoever is next to them with their car door, there's been a notable increase in crime in the area in the past year, hallways constantly smell like weed and garbage, terrible to go for walks as it's on a main commercial road, and it's hard for me to justify paying more for a 2BR apartment with these conditions. At that point, I'd rather ""go for broke"" and really stretch our budget just to have some peace and be paying into an asset (but I won't actuallyyy do that, hence wanting to beef up down payment/reserve savings...).  The school system in our current town is also not good, but the towns around us where we'd like to buy are excellent.  Also, if my spouse does find employment, we would want to employ an au pair for childcare, which would require being able to provide them with at least their own room, if not their own bathroom.  If we have kids while renting, we will need to pay for daycare which can be more expensive than au pairs in our area, and will also make it more difficult to continue being a 1-car family (which we want to be).   

**Other Info**: I'm pretty disciplined when I create a savings goal--there's really no ""fear"" that I'd plan to save money and that I'd end up spending it.  I don't like the idea of borrowing from my 401K for a down payment because of the rules about paying it back and how changing jobs could affect paying it back.  ",1731955296.0

2-Once I get my green card (I assume could be around august) I want to go to Cuba and marry her, the wedding itself should not be more than 300, we want something simple, the honeymoon could be around 300-400, and the flight to Cuba and back could be around 300-1000 who knows lol, and also I want to go out with her and my friends a little so add 200 more xD. 

After that I want to start all the process for her to get to the us, prices may vary for everything, but definetely we are looking at +$2500 in the whole 1.5-3 years the process could last.

3-Shortly after marrying I want to continue my studies, I want to go 2 years in community college for my associate, and of course asking for student aid, in Miami-Dade College it should not be more than 2k per semester without the financial help. Then I would start with another 2+ years in Florida International University, but who knows if I would have the same job or the same situation.

How to achieve them?

What should I do every time I get paid? How much should I aim to save monthly, I was saving 1200 monthly but at work they told to cut off some of the overtime so I‚Äôm now around 800-1000 monthly.

Should I start investing some of that money? At least a little portion? Is there any way to make money online and add up a little? I already feel that I‚Äôm behind in my life and my financial situation is horrible, I would be graduating extremely late (I assume 25-26) and I really don‚Äôt know how to handle some of the stuff that‚Äôs coming

personalfinance,Employer Payroll Not Allowing Me to Reduce My Tax Withholdings By Any Meaningful Amount,"Hi all, I am planning on filing Ch 7 Bankruptcy in Jan or Feb 2025, and my attorney advised me to reduce my tax withholdings as much as possible, because the trustee can take possession of my tax refund as an asset come April tax refund time (for what its worth, my federal tax refund last year was around $2400 and my state refund was around $1200). In other words, I want to have as close to zero tax refund as possible, because the bankruptcy trustee will be able to take it from me. 

My current paycheck withholding is $934 federal and $240 state. Via my employer's online payroll portal, I submitted a new W-4 which literally reduced both federal and state tax withholdings to 0. (Given I only had 4 paychecks left this year when I did this 2 weeks ago, I felt I needed to reduce the withholdings to as close to 0 as possible), in order to align with the estimated total $3600 refund.

However, the paycheck I got this last Friday only had like $10 less withheld! How is it possible to collectively reduce federal and state taxes by $1170, but only had $10 reduction withheld in my paycheck?

I chatted with my employer payroll and they said that my marital status and # of dependents can impact how much the company can legally reduce the withholding for me. FYI I am single and have 0 dependents.

Can anyone shed some light on this and help me out? I want to be confident in my company's payroll, but I feel like they may not know what they are doing.

If I am single and have 0 dependents - and my W-4 is otherwise ""normal"" with no exemptions or anything, is it normal for it to basically be impossible to get any withholding reduction more than a negligible amount (ex. $10....?)

Thanks.",1731872775.0
personalfinance,Would you buy a home in my situation or wait?,"I don't know if I should buy a home now or wait.

I am in my early 30's. I currently gross 157k/year. My job is stable. My credit score is 805. I am single, live alone, and my monthly expenses are $2623, no debts. I have 198k in cash. My net is $8589/month, my gross is $13,097. I rent currently at ~$1500/month which will be going up by 5% when I next renew my lease in a few months. I put 6% of my gross into my 401k which my employer matches, I also max out my HSA pre-tax and put 7500 into a Roth IRA post tax every year. I live in a high income tax state so after everything this leaves me with NET of $7964 per month after taxes and retirement contributions.

I am what you would call frugal, though I don't try to be, I just have a hard time spending money. I currently live well beneath my means. I have no debt. My old car is paid off. Not counting my retirement accounts which I will not be touching for any reason for at least 30 years, I currently have 198k cash saved up rolling into 4 week Treasury bills yielding me 4.589%, this is the easily accessible cash on hand I have intended to use 150k of to purchase a home. Keeping the rest for emergency fund and job loss safety net as I have no friends or family in my life to ask for help if anything in my life goes wrong. I am adding $5341 to this pile every month.

The median price for homes in my area is 655k and they seem to be going up by 3-5% per year. Though this year they are the same as they were last year. If I bought the typical home right now putting 131k as the 20% down-payment assuming an 6.5% mortgage, (I assume if i shop around at least 3 mortgage lenders I can get a 6.5% mortgage rate since they are ~7% today) then my monthly payment will be ~$3871. This includes property taxes, homeowners insurance, mortgage interest and principle, and hoa. 

This would put my debt to income at 30%.

A payment of $3871 feels insane to me, and the Amortization schedule of the loan means I'll be paying in total 1.192 million for a 655k house, so I pay in just interest $668,333. I get that you can refinance assuming rates ever come back to earth, make extra payments, etc etc. to make this less insane.

As far as I can tell this is nearly the worst most expensive time to buy a house in the history of the housing market, and I don't need a house. I am under no pressure to buy. But I have always deeply wanted my own home and I feel like it would massively improve my quality of life. The cheaper houses under the median are very much starter homes and will require a lot of work, I'd rather get something around the median that is move in ready if I decide to buy. If I go down this path I will be a first time home buyer. The way I live right now, I should be able to continue to save around 65k cash each year if I don't buy a house. As for future relationships, I intend to remain childfree by choice. I also intend to remain in the home for at least 15 years maybe forever if I buy.

So, if you were in my situation what would you do?",1731878944.0

Not considering those debts in my monthly expenses for bills, I probably pay about $2000 give or take in bills. Not including fun things. (Minimum payments for CC and car are $405 & $705 respectively.) If I truly buckled down I could put $1358 monthly towards the CC and have it paid off in 12 months but that would leave me with not much left over. 

Should I just bite the bullet and pay off the CC? Or should I just try a little over the minimum payment? I've also heard talks about transferring to a different credit card or getting personal loans to pay it off with lower interest. Is there any merit in those options? 

What about debt relief companies? I don't want to shut this credit card down after it's paid off, so I'm not sure exactly what debt relief companies do.

I also want to start investing in ETFs and things that can help me be financially free at some point! I just worry about waiting because I am not getting any younger.

I have worked in the same medical office the past 6 years, but over that time I have tried to venture out in finding something new to make more money. After graduating, I thought I wanted to go into nursing school so I applied about a year later to a few schools but got denied, then tried another year and got denied again. I then went onto trying e-commerce, and I sold a product online but I failed to make money off of that. I ended up losing money cause I spent so much on inventory, photography, packaging, ads, inspection, and in return there was no profit. I sold all my inventory at a loss and that was the end of that. During that same time, I tried to make some money off crypto, I put in a few thousand but its been a loss, I have been negative for two years now...waiting for it to go back up to cash out evenly. Then, I got my loan license in my state thinking I can start doing that and make money but the market is extremely difficult in my area, and I was getting 0 leads. I have applied to thousands of jobs in my area, on and off for 3 years and rarely get a call back. I updated my resume with the help of Chat GPT and perfected it using the STAR method, thinking I would for sure get called back but still nothing. I am having a hard time getting hired which is so confusing to me cause I'm not sure how it is possible to apply to thousands of jobs and not get a call back? 3 years ago I opened up a ROTH and contributed what I could at the time but I stopped last year cause I can't contribute at the moment. I want to make at least 10k/mo and go up from there, I feel like I've tried a variety of things to be successful.

**What Happened?**

Today I started getting warning lights on my car that the transmission was having issues, took the car to a shop and they confirmed it would be about $5,000, about half of what the cars worth is on Blue Book. Not wanting to invest that amount of money back into the car, I sold it for around 8K.

I am looking to buy a car, and wanted to get some different perspectives outside of my family.

**Financials**

32 years old, make about 105,000 salary, living in DMV area (my exact location is not the highest cost of living in the DMV, I will call it moderate).

I save 1,200 - 1,500 a month without intensely trying to budget.

I have 70k in a HYSA , 15k in investments, and do not own property yet - although that is a shorter term goal if the housing market settles down.

I have no debt

I am not looking to buy anything frivolous, like an expensive sports car, but would like something ""nice"".

**Questions**

1. Am I insane for thinking it is a good idea to be looking in the price range of 20-25k for a used car with where I am at financially? This would be \~12-17K out of pocket (plus taxes and titles).
2. If the above is not absolutely insane, should I pull the entire amount out of savings and pay in full in cash? Do I finance the entire remainder cost? Or a hybrid approach where I would only pull out half of the amount of what's needed and finance the rest? My previous car was fully paid for, so I am not sure how I feel about adding a large monthly bill that was not present before.

Exciting, right? Unfortunately, company health is a bit questionable -- my increase in salary is coming as a result of greatly increased responsibility. My immediate supervisor is being let go basically for being too expensive (several times my own salary), other layoffs have occurred, fundraising is ongoing. Certainly the company will look much different in a year.

I have never been in such a position before, in fact this is my first for-profit org for which I have ever worked, and I could use some on advice on how to protect myself in this stage of uncertainty even as my income increases.

* Retirement Contribution: **15% to Roth 401k -- no match**
* Take-home: $3360 (insurance premium 100% covered by company)

The house next to my mom is listed at $210,000, though I think we could negotiate it down to $200,000. It needs some work, but I know a solid contractor who lives a few houses down. I‚Äôd likely set aside around $20,000 for initial renovations. However, the local public schools aren‚Äôt highly rated, which is a concern. There‚Äôs a good private school nearby, though, with tuition around $6,000 a year until high school, where it increases to $12,000 annually.

One hesitation I have is due to a major construction project planned near our current home ‚Äî one of the biggest developments in the area. This project could significantly increase our home‚Äôs value over time, so I‚Äôm worried about potentially leaving money on the table by selling too soon.

On the other hand, moving next to my mom would mean a lower mortgage at around 6% with a VA loan, making our new monthly payment roughly $800 ‚Äî saving us $1,200 each month. We could even opt for a 15-year loan and still have manageable payments.

Is the proximity to family and the lower mortgage worth it, even if we risk missing out on future appreciation of our current home? Any advice or personal experiences would be really helpful!",1731941869.0
personalfinance,Options to fund shares purchase in S-corp?,"I am the operations manager at a privately owned engineering firm in TX, USA. A minority owner is retiring at the end of the quarter, and the majority owner is offering me a chance to buy those shares and become a partner in the firm. The shares are a ballpark of $1 million.

personalfinance,Need help planning how to spend money beyond weekly budgetting,"
Help with understanding how to spend or save large amounts of money without running out, and why? How do people spend responsibly on big things?

We need help figuring out how to spend money. We used to figure out if we could buy something depending on how much money was in our account (not much at the time) but we could never get ahead that way, and freqentlygot im trouble with unexpected expenses. It was understandable when we only made a little, but we kept doing it even when ourpaycheck got better.

Now we finally figured out a weekly budget and for the most part don't go over that for small discretionary spending, but we got ourselves in trouble again by started an urgent building project with all our extra money, then being stuck home for a storm, missing work for being sick, and then both cars breaking at the same time. Now we have bills coming due that we can't pay on time, even though we make plenty of money. We're down to ""beans and rice"" again (and a few other things).

We've figured out budgetting day to day stuff for the most part, but how do people with lots of money budget the big things? How do you plan for large expenses like taxes or unexpected business expenses? How do you gradually get ahead?

Budgetting used to seem like arbitrarily picking limits to spend on certain things,and now I view it a lot differently as living within our means, planning for small unexpected expenses, etc. But now I'm having a hard time with how to approach large amounts of money and large expenses. Now that we're budgetting the small stuff, we can do the big stuff. But what else is it for? Why not soend all of it, other than an emergency fund? How much is the right amount to save versus spend? It all seems arbitrary to me again. A weekly budget makes sense now, because it's not arbitrary. I finally understand spending less than what you make, instead of whatever you have on hand. But the big stuff is confusing. 

How do people gradually become more wealthy without spending everything? Isn't the point of weekly and monthly budgetting so that you spend on big things? If we're saving extra for unexpected things, how much do we plan for? Is it arbitrary? I really need help with this conceptually. I know I'm missing something.",1731947739.0

personalfinance,Paying off all debt as soon as possible ,"Hey all looking for some advice 

My boyfriend and I are slowly paying off our debt. I am in my final semester of college and he has been helping me pay for school out of pocket. I put each payment on my credit card and then pay it off but of course due to other expenses my credit card is currently sitting at 3K. He has almost 9K on his credit card. Now in the spring I will have exactly 3 payments of about $450 that will be added to the card but we have been worried about his card growing so much so we are trying to decide on the best game plan for us. 

I make $2400 a month and he makes $2600 a month, our rent is $950. Starting this next month I will start paying all expenses in our house (besides his car payment, $270) and he will put his entire paycheck towards his card with the exception of his car payment. My school payments will be added to my card and I will pay the minimum balance due. It will take 4 months to pay off his card this way and after that we will switch and he will pay all expenses (besides my car payment, $273) at that point my card will be at at least 5K so it will take me at most 3 months to pay off my card. 

He has no phone payment and I pay $80 a month for my own phone plan (I have a separate bucket that I add money into each month so this can be left alone to pay for itself), all utilities except electric included in our rent, which is usually around $100 a month and internet is $80 a month. We are budgeting to keep $150 from each paycheck in our accounts for gas and groceries. We are prepared to be extremely frugal and do what it takes to pay this off as fast as we can.

personalfinance,College 529 Funds - rolling over to IRA,"So this post is not about the new rules in regards to 529 and rolling over to IRA but more about the tax scenarios involving earned income and how that affects contribution limits.

You can contribute - whatever is lesser of the two - your total earned income amount or the IRS-mandated contribution limit for a year. Separately, tax filing thresholds are almost twice what the contribution limit is for any given year. So, hypothetically, how would the IRS know if you max the IRA contribution limit from a college 529 rollover vs just against what you earned as income if you don't have to file a tax return?

EXAMPLE:

Earned Income: $4K   IRA Contribution Limit: $10K    Tax Filing Threshold: $15K    529 Funds: $100K

I roll $10K from my 529 funds into a Roth IRA - how would the IRS know I'm only supposed to rollover $4K if I don't  have to file a tax return? Say my earned income is all cash.

Perhaps the question is more general than relating to a 529 fund. I'm currently looking into opening a few for my kids so this was a question I was pondering.",1731947403.0

personalfinance,Enterprise/National Accident with no Insurance,"Hello, just looking for some guidance. A couple of weeks ago I flew home and rented a car from National picking the Emerald Isle option. There was a BMW X1 in the isle that they let me take for the same price. The next day, after burning the candle at both ends traveling, I was on my way to my aunts house and I fell asleep at the wheel. I ended up going into the median and I hit a dirt mound that caused front end damage and caused the airbags to deploy (see images). Overall I know its bad; I had a 2007 Silverado totaled due to a fender bender that you could barely notice last year, quoted $7,000 in repairs, so I can only imagine what this level of damage would cost on a BMW.

On the scene, OnStar (or something) came on asking if I was ok and that they were sending help. I got out of the car.... fine. I'm still fine, no concussion, etc.. The only lingering issue is the guilty overthinking of what could have happened... but that's a different discussion. On scene the officer came out and we did a sobriety test, blew a 0, and I admitted fault. She wrote me a $185 Reckless Driving ticket which I paid the next morning, but otherwise, everything was fine.

The next day I started digging into my rental details and discovered that that rental, and every rental I've had over the last 3 years (quite a few), has had all the insurance options declined. I have a code on my account from work (a perk) that I had always assumed took care of the insurance, but I guess it doesn't and I opted out of all the insurance options when setting up my online account with National, so when I go to reserve a rental online, it never asks. I currently live out of the country so I have no personal auto insurance, because I have no vehicle in the US. Luckily, I have a Chase Amazon Visa that I used to rent the car and in talking with them over a few day period, discovered that they are able to be the primary insurer with an uploaded *Statutory Declaration of no personal auto insurance.* The Credit Card states that it covers up to $60,000 in damages on non-exotic vehicles not valued over $125,000 USD. A 2025 BMW X1 is a small-luxury SUV that MSRPs around $42k to $52k. In the details, I dont see anything that would disqualify them covering me and I've already began the process with them

So how screwed am I?

Worst case the vehicle is a total loss? If that happens I imagine I'd basically have to buy the car if the card above for whatever reason doesn't do anything. If its repairable then I'd be directly responsible for all and any costs?

Lets say worse case, total loss, and I have a $50k bill to pay. Do I take the credit hit (currently 825) and settle the debt in collections? Do I just kiss my savings goodbye (which could cover the cost of one of those vehicles) and see the silver lining of still not having any debt?

Is there anything I could do in the aftermath? Lawyers or something. Work with my old insurance carrier to see if they can help, etc. I'm still waiting to hear back, so I have no idea what is to come numerically speaking.

Do I make 10% overpayments now until expiry of current mortgage term to lower the principal and simultaneously save up for a deposit...?

Or do I just carry on saving for the next property, not overpay, and just remortgage the HTB loan in 2027?

Dilemma is obviously rates are going to be much higher than when originally mortgaged. So likely to be around 5% when I remortgage in 2027. So do I just lower the principal now and not pay the hefty 20% equity loan, and just keep saving for another deposit

Or

Don't do overpayments, don't pay loan in 2027, keep saving for deposit and just buy another house and rent this one out when the term expires - this provides highest cash flow in the short term. Trouble with this is the impact of adding the 20% loan amount to the principal to a much higher interest rate

* You do *not* need *short* term disability insurance if you have a decent emergency fund?
* Long term disability is four times more expensive (for me) through a 3rd party vs a group policy at work.  The logic of ""you could lose your job, and therefore lose your insurance"" convinced me to switch from group to term for life insurance.  But I'm not sure if it's worth the cost for disability.
* If you have decent 401k savings, can or should you rely on ""hardship withdraws?"" instead of insurance.  I could contribute the amount that would be going to disability insurance to my 401k instead.

personalfinance,Trying to start fresh,"Have a baby coming in a few months and wanted to get a more family friendly vehicle, but come to find my DTI is way too high for approvals. I didn't account for them taking in my full mortgage payment instead of seeing it as a joint payment so now I'm screwed out of finding a vehicle without a lot of cash. I have some extra debts from a credit card and a car loan I'm upside down on that also aren't helping. 

I was looking into getting a debt consolidation loan to help me lower my DTI but I'm not sure if I'd even qualify with my current DTI. I made the plan to ask for a loan that'll pay off my credit card, cover my negative equity in my car to sell, and buy a cheap vehicle outright to cut all my monthly payments down to just the mortgage and loan.

In your experiences, would going to a credit union be my best option at getting someone to approve this? Is it even feasible going this route? Would they help me get things straightened back out so I can stop stressing and focus on this baby? ",1731922357.0

I am an Australian citizen moving to an EU country where I also hold citizenship. I have never lived there before, but have visited. I will have a passport but I need to live there for a minimum of 6 months before I can obtain an ID card which is an official form of identification there. 

I will be needing to apply for a personal (student) loan from a bank in the EU country. This loan may be (and is allowed to be) used for study abroad (ie. outside of the EU country). 

Can you foresee, generally, any issues I may have in obtaining a loan if I have just moved to this country?

personalfinance,Am I over leveraging on my monthly payments?,"In over my head with monthly payments?

Hello Reddit,

I am married, 24 years old, and I‚Äôm currently making ~$108,000 annually with RSUs for around $50,000 this year, and an annual bonus of around $10,000. 

Post- tax I take home around 4000 a month with 401k, and closer to $6700 without. 

I recently purchased a home for around ~400k, with a monthly payment of 3100. I was previously renting at 2100. 

Pre-tax 401k - ~$2000

House 7% - $3100 (400k remaining)
car 8% - $860. (39,000 remaining)
Utilities - $500. 
Student loans - $400 (25k remaining)

Unvested RSU value: $175,000

Is this over leveraging? I am afraid with a near 50% contribution to 401k while I will max in June next year for the first few months I will only be making ~4000 a month. 
Also, with kids I‚Äôm worrying about starting HSA contributions for daycare from pre-tax money. 

How would you handle your contributions? Is this too much monthly?

Do you have any suggestions for how I can improve my situation?

My priorities are getting out of debt as quickly as possibly so I can enjoy the income, and behind saving seriously without a constant monthly drain on my head. Work is enough. 

Edit: 401k: ~40k
Savings: ~5k

Currently, I rent and do not own a home or any rental properties. I‚Äôm trying to save for a home. I earn about $60,000 annually pre-tax, and my wife earns $29,000 annually post-tax. Together, we take home approximately $3,000‚Äì$3,200 per month. We live in Georgia.

I contribute 15% of my paycheck to a 401(k) biweekly, and my employer provides a 6% company match. My total retirement savings currently sit at $66,000: $9,000 in a Roth IRA and $56,000 in my 401(k), which is a Roth 401(k). My wife has about $3,000 in a Roth IRA, and that‚Äôs her only retirement account. We try to max out our Roth IRAs each year, but it‚Äôs sometimes challenging. Depending on the year, we might contribute $3,000, $5,000, or $7,000 in total.

My wife drives a 2023 Toyota Corolla with 26,000 miles on it, which is fully paid off. I drive a 2024 Corolla Hybrid with 13,000 miles. I could pay it off today, but that would leave us with only $6,000 in our bank account. We are prioritizing building our savings to $10,000 before paying off the car. Once my car is fully paid off, we‚Äôll be debt-free and able to save aggressively for a home.

If all goes as planned, I‚Äôll become a registered nurse in 2025, and my wife plans to enroll in dental hygienist school that same year.

My main concern is whether my investments are on track. Am I balanced enough? Are my fund choices the best available? What would you do differently? I‚Äôm 31 and feel worried that I haven‚Äôt yet reached the $100,000 mark in retirement savings.

personalfinance,Need help understanding why one would do an annuity,"So the other day a family member said I should pull the trigger and retire in a few years and setup an annuity.  While I've followed the FIRE path for a long time and am well vested with 401k/IRA, etc., I knew very little of an annuity.  So began my research.

Now here am I wondering, why in the world would anyone actually do this?  Is there a legitimate use case I can't think of?

Ultimately my thinking is boiling down to, if you have the capital to go with an annuity, why would you not just pay yourself out from that to begin with?  But rather you're trading a huge lump sump for steady (mostly..) income and losing control of your wad of $$$?

Me: 41M, Executive Chef at a retirement community.  Single with a 12 year old who I have 50/50 custody of though never married and I live alone in a 1 bedroom that I pay $1950/month for.

Annual income before tax and 3% 401K contributions - $74K.

Spent almost $10K on a lawyer to gain 50/50 and as a result have to pay that back $7K in loans on CC's as well as a friend who loaned me $3K.

I also owe about $4,500 in taxes after erroneously filing 2 years ago. (This is accruing interest unfortunately.)

I also have a car loan that has about $15K left.

And finally I have student loans from culinary school that I have not ever been able to pay on that are sitting at about $50K.

Any thoughts from anyone on any of this?  Besides filing for bankruptcy as I am not inclined to do this as it will only forgive portions of my debt.

Edit:
In MA...
Take home after payroll deductions: $4100/month
Rent:  $1950
CC payments (total): $500

personalfinance,HSA or No Deductible Plan for Upcoming Medical Expenses?,"Hi all. I‚Äôm relatively new to this so bear with me.

Long story short: I most likely have some form of IBD. For one reason or another, I haven‚Äôt had time to get it checked out but am planning on having my first colonoscopy this year. I‚Äôm early 40‚Äôs and have an HSA with a small balance and could technically afford any out of pocket expenses that might arise in 2025. In other words, I could continue funding it and reimburse myself later if need be. 

The issue is that my employer only gives me $500 each year and the deductible is $1500 in the HSA plan. In 2025 I‚Äôm being offered a no deductible PPO and the ability to use any remaining restricted funds that are the low deductible PPO account I had before I had an HSA ($1500 or so that accumulated some years ago when I was on another plan). In other words if I switch to the no deductible plan and work through my digestive issues next year I‚Äôll have no deductible and $1500 to use for anything health related. If I stick with the HSA I‚Äôll get $500 for free but will have a $1500 deductible and will forever lose the restricted funds in the PPO account. 

One additional piece of info: the difference in cost between these two plans isn‚Äôt much‚Ä¶$40 a month. So in my thinking it may be smart to do the no deductible plan for one year to figure out what‚Äôs wrong health wise and have free ‚Äúmoney‚Äù to use if I need it. But then again I could technically afford to pay anything out of pocket, invest money in an HSA, and reimburse myself later. Thoughts?

personalfinance,Taxable Brokerage versus 401K loan for remainder of down payment.,"We are building a new home, which is now ahead of schedule due to the two homes in front of ours either changing lots or not getting approved for financing. We do not need to sell our current home to qualify for our new home. We went into pre-approval with nearly all savings in our bank that would be put towards 20% down payment with some rolled into higher rate CD's that were set to mature the month prior to our original build date. We were told to expect some delays due to building over winter months, which is why the CD's were reinvested for another 6 month window before we signed our contract.

All good problems to have except that now being ahead of schedule means we are going to be short 25K or so with most of that from the extra two months of savings missed and the CD's. We fully fund our retirement, and would be able to repay a 401K loan in the coming year giving us more of a cushion if needed.  This is what my dad had initially advised if we were short on funds or if build went quicker than expected. However I have 45K in taxable brokerage mostly in SCHB and some initial firms from starter investing before I moved to ETF, these have turned a good profit since the pandemic and all are now firmly back in gains territory ranging from 13% to 117%.

I know I'd pay myself back the 401K loan interest, but wouldn't it be better to sell the taxable shares in 2025 which would mean the 15% long term gains tax would be due in 2026 and keep the 401K in market? I could then reinvest out of the original holdings fully into SCHB or redistribute from lower profit stock no longer of interest and it would lock in some of the profits earned in past 5+ years. This taxable account is long term holdings for retirement or additional savings cushion as an extended emergency fund as I also have a deferred compensation plan to augment any early retirement and most of my extra funds go there to the maximum each year.

No one can predict the market, and with recent election, the interest rates and other movement has been all over the place so just want to ensure I am not missing an obvious benefit or reason to take out the 401K loan versus cover any shortage if they remain ahead of schedule with the taxable holdings.

I doubt based on the current timelines if the schedule at this point would fluctuate more than a month and go back to original dates, so just trying to be ready for having to fund ahead of the CD maturity dates.

personalfinance,Pledged Asset Line for home purchase,"I have been investing for a while now and one of my accounts has a value of about $500k with a cost basis of roughly $150k . Within the next six months, I will likely need $250k for a down payment on a home but I am concerned about the up-front tax hit. The account is at Schwab and I was looking into a pledged asset line. My understanding is that a PAL does not show up on a credit report and I am free to use this money as down payment with no impact to my DTI ratio with the bank/mortgage company. 



I am considering pledging the full account and draw $250k for down payment with the intention to liquidate roughly $50k annually the next five years to spread out the capital gains tax hit and pay back the draw. I want to see if others has done the same with a PAL and if there is anything you would do differently? Maybe liquidate a different amount annually ($25k? $10k?) instead and spread out the loan even longer? Other than spreading out the taxes, another reason that I want to put myself on a liquidation schedule is to mitigate the risk of a black swan event where my portfolio declines over 50% and I'm stuck in a situation where I need to transfer funds from another account to Schwab to have sufficient collateral.



Another question I have is if it makes sense for me to pledge the full account? Since I only need $250k, would it make sense for me to pledge about $350k and draw the full available $250k (\~70%)?",1731889512.0

But the cheapest insurance I could find, for the lowest level of coverage my state allows (25/50/25), was $83 a month.

personalfinance,Wife is in hospice. We expect some monetary gifts that will be put to our children' 529 plans. Lots of questions.,"So as the title, my lovely wife (35F) has started hospice two days ago after fighting colon cancer for the past 3.5 years. We have 3 young boys (5YO, 3.5YO, 3.5YO). Due to costly medical procedures, we have never had extra money to put aside for the their education. We are expecting gifts (a few hundreds to a few thousands dollars) from relatives/friends. We already have funeral fund reserved, so we want to set this money aside for college if they so choose in the future. I have been researching for the past few weeks regarding 529 plans for our state Maryland.

However, there are a few questions I still have:

* Should I go with Maryland 529 plans instead of Nevada (or any other states) 529 plans? NV 529 seem to have the best reviews/recommendations due to their low fees, better yield/returns for investment. Going with MD 529 plans, I will have $2500/child tax deduction, which seem to be a minimal benefit compared to the better yield rates of NV 529 plans. MD 529 is administered by T. Rowe Price.
* It seems that I can open an umbrella 529 plan under my name (36 year-old) and name our kids as beneficiaries. Would that help with their Financial Aid situation in anyway? Any benefits of doing that instead of individual 529 plans for each child? From my understanding, if they have assets (529 plans under their names) during the FAFSA application, their Financial Aid amount will be smaller. I don't want to take advantage of the system, but I also want the best potential support for my children and maximize the value of our investment.
* If I choose MD plans, should I avoid MD's prepaid trust plan? It seems great on paper, but so many parents have issues getting money. Is that still an issue?
* Any other plans I should look at? Opening a 529 plans with Vanguard seems to be a pretty good investment as well. MD 529 (ran by T. Rowe Price) has higher fee (.64%) than Vanguard (.03%).
* My wife has been staying at home for the past 7 years, so she has insufficient social credits. Hence, the children will not get any survivor benefits. I am on my own to support them, which I have no complaints about. I just want to ensure the best possible future for them.

personalfinance,Rent vs buy when escaping foreclosure?,"Hello! If this is above Reddit‚Äôs pay grade I would love at least a direction to head in re: how to vet potential financial advisors.

So unfortunately the home I live in, owned by my mother, has been encumbered by a loan that is too large and has too short a deadline to be paid off (hard money lender). The foreclosure process hasn‚Äôt begun yet but it likely will by mid-next-year.

My cousin and I, combined, take home about $6,800/month after taxes + insurance and before any expenses.

The COL in our area is fairly high, so we can easily spend around $700/month on groceries alone for just the two of us before cat food and supplies. We already cook at home, and I usually eat fresh vegetables and canned goods, no meat, to try and pinch as many pennies as possible. Cousin requires a little more variety, so she eats meat, but overall we stick to versatile pantry ingredients. Internet is $100/month, phones are $120/month, and due to our current poor insulation, utilities are about $400/month and will likely go up as things get colder. We only drive to work, to the grocery store, and home, and gas is about ~$100/month.

We currently support my mother in full. She has no active source of income, and her bankruptcy should end in about 7 months. What we could be paying towards a mortgage is currently going towards storage units for things that were once held in a second house that has since been sold out of necessity. Money from that sale has been spent.

For my cousin and I, everything NOT OPTIONAL calculated together, including $30/mo in subscriptions and $130/mo for cat food and supplies but not including a possible rent/mortgage, our baseline lives cost $1,830/month to maintain.

For my mother, including her specific bills, subscriptions, health debt, gas, and groceries, her baseline is ~$1,350/month.

Storage fees are about $2,800/month. Assistance with these fees come from various one-off gifts from friends and family that are thankfully more well off.

Since the home we live in is definitely unaffordable, we have a disagreement regarding what the best option is for what housing everyone should move into.

My mother has no savings to speak of. She invested everything that divorce from my father didn‚Äôt take into starting a business, which failed. Any money she has is from either me and Cousin, or one-off handouts from friends and family.

My mom‚Äôs plan is as follows: Cousin and I purchase a fixer-upper house, which would cost up to $3,500/mo including mortgages and insurance (one mortgage for the purchase and one to cover the down payment; total depends on what we offer and what is accepted) but not utilities and I don‚Äôt believe taxes. There is no HOA to contend with. We pare down storage contents and dump the remaining objects into it. My mom moves in there, cousin and I follow temporarily. Mom improves a closed off section of the house with help from some connections she has (paid for by BARTER, not anything from us kids), and rents it out to cover the mortgage. After that is settled she would find her own employment in the nearby city. The moment my mother‚Äôs bankruptcy ends, we hand the rights to and monetary responsibilities of the house over to her and leave for our own apartment.

She is extremely domineering, opinionated, and difficult to live with long-term, so unless I would save up enough to retire by continuing to share a house with her, my immediate first move once possible would be to rent somewhere else with my cousin.

We could also just tell my mom we refuse to buy this house, and tell her that we could pay for part of her life, maybe a small apartment, some groceries, and her bills, but that would be the extent of our assistance. The average two-bedroom apartment in our area would be around $2,400/mo, not including utilities or any extra fees that apartment-hunt websites secretly omit.

My mom insists that it will always be more beneficial to everyone to own a property with a rental income, and NEVER rent from somewhere else. I understand where she is coming from, but I would prefer an option where I can disconnect from her and start reliably having my own savings. I already gave what few thousands I had squirreled away to support mom years ago‚Äîwe‚Äôve had monetary issues for ages. I can‚Äôt advance in my life without getting my savings built back up.

She very likely will not sell the current house before it enters foreclosure‚Äîshe insists on trying to fight the financers in court. We can assume any extra money from selling it will not be available.

So, assuming we all do the same things we are currently doing, just without any storage, which option would most likely provide more financial security in the long term?

* Cousin and I purchase house with up to $3,500/mo mortgage + insurance, live there and wait for it to be monetized, then hand off to my mother after 7 months-1 year so we can move out
* Cousin and I scale back assistance we provide and move into our own apartment as soon as possible, with $2,400/mo rent before utilities, with housing for my mother going anywhere between $900/mo to $1,400/mo depending on where she lives and before she gains employment or housing assistance

personalfinance,Pro-Rata rule can sometimes be desirable?,"I have read a lot about the pro-rata rule (in the context of Backdoor Roth) and this is my current understanding. It is not a penalty, nor is it double taxation. It is effectively just converting pre-tax money into post-tax money, which seems to be not always ""bad"" depending on your financial goals. If you have pre-tax dollars sitting in a IRA account, pro-rata rule will trigger when the backdoor roth is executed. But that means over time, the basis in that IRA account increases, meaning that in the future you have to pay less taxes on that money upon withdrawal (because your increasing your basis). Building up basis over time can be a legitimate financial strategy.

2. **Can he dispute any of these charges?** Is there any way to request an audit or speak to a consumer protection agency to look into whether he was overcharged?
3. **What steps can he take to avoid these issues in the future?** For those who‚Äôve been through the mortgage process, any tips on spotting hidden fees and negotiating better terms?

We also haven‚Äôt received any statements, details of key benefits, or other relevant updates regarding the product.  


The original documentation we have indicates some sort of ¬£20,000 per annum payout, but it does not clarify under what circumstances or when this would be claimable.

There are a few articles online, whereby people had issues in receiving the investment value: See Guardian Article, from 2007 titled:¬†Long-term care bond victory.

It would appear that 'Pru Intl review shuts LTC bond' in 2003.

If anyone has insights or additional information about this bond, I would greatly appreciate your input.

personalfinance,How much house can I afford?,"I thought there was a wiki in this subreddit that explains everything for first time home buyers but I can't seem to find it.

Right now I'm living with my father after graduating college making a salary of $110,000. Take home pay is 2700 bi-weekly and gross pay is 4069 bi-weekly.

The only debt I have is student loand debt. I have $40,000 remaining and just balance transfered 10,000 to a 0% interest CC that I have to pay within 2 years. I can easily pay it living at home with my dad because he's only charging me $500 a month to live here right now, so I have an opportunity to save money.

personalfinance,Looking for personal finance software to replace Quicken,"I've been using Quicken forever (20+ years now), but as the years go by, it just seems to perform worse, though it still has all the features I need to manage everything I need. My biggest gripe with Quicken these days is how slow it is to download the transactions for all of my linked accounts. It typically takes several minutes for about 5 accounts.

Over the past few years, I've looked at several alternatives (Empower, Mint, Rocket Money), and the biggest issue I've seen with them all is that none of them appear to let you manually add expected future transactions to linked accounts. I do this all the time in Quicken to plan out my expenses for the next month.

I'd love to find something that could link to my accounts like Quicken, but maybe perform a little bit better, and offer planning tools similar to what Quicken has.

Is there something out there that might fit the bill?

personalfinance,Looking for advice on house purchase at 7.5% interest rate vs staying in current home ,"Looking for some honest opinions on current situation. 

Current combined income month AFTER taxes: Oct-May $11,210 is and May-Oct is $10,250. Fluctuation reason is bc health insurance only gets deducted for 6 months out of the year from husbands paycheck. 

Currently own a home at 2.4% interest rate and have $170k left on the payoff. Current payment is $1049 per month. Super cheap I know.  

Found a new house I absolutely love. New mortgage payment after 20% down and considering the high interest rate now would be somewhere between 2,500-2,600/month factoring in taxes and homeowners insurance. 

We have 2 car payments, a camper payment, and other smaller debts. I‚Äôve ran the numbers and it appears that we can afford it, while still being able to save 1k per month, but it‚Äôll be tight. We also have 3 kids; one older barely adult, one heading to college soon and one in junior high. 

Husband will be getting promoted in January which will come with approx an additional +500 per month, plus ancompany truck and fuel paid for. And I receive general salary increase every July 3% which will be another $300 per month, approx.

I don‚Äôt want to bank on any increases though. And I don‚Äôt want to lower my savings amount per month. 

Here is why we‚Äôre considering the move. I am spending a ridiculous amount of time driving to the school multiple times a day for sports, anything is 15-20 mins away (we live rural). And also, we have some water issues as we have 5 people living in our home. We drilled a new well a few years ago but still during periods of drought it becomes a weekly issue that puts an undue burden on my husband. I could drill another well again, but there is never a guarantee we will hit good water enough to sustain this many people in our household. And I hate conserving water. I realize now we can buy whatever, save a lot , and go on trips, etc. but this is the trade off. The new purchase would mean no more water issues and no more extra spent on gas and time driving back and forth everywhere. 

I also work from home, husband does not.

Financial Stats:

Credit score: 770s

Debt: Around 60k (20k student loans, 30k new car which was absolutely necessary, unfortunately.)

Savings: $45k (I save $3k a month. Goal: $100k.)

Salary: $86k 

401k: Not positive. I believe under $10k. (I match my companies 5% which I believe gives me $300 a month.)

HSA: $1k (I get $200 a month from my employer.)

Thats all. My goal is to continue saving as much money as I can to aid in my retirement & future investments (like a house). 

I know it isnt too bad but I am so anxious that I am not doing more, I know I can do more, I just have a severe gap in knowledge. I see people post about having $700k in investments or stocks & I feel behind. Speaking of S&P500, bitcoin & beyond. I dont even know if that means they have $700k to their name fully or just hypothetically because its a stock. I grew up in poverty so I taught myself everything. I feel the knowledge I am missing is what isnt easily taught/told to do by, say, Google. 

What else can I do to better at, or add to my portfolio? If you recommend investing, could you please give me a resource I can start reading into? I am so new to stocks, I dont want to go in & waste money.

Much appreciated. Apologies if this comes off frantic. I have had anxiety for a month about this but today I woke up with chest pain & said enough is enough.

personalfinance,Would it be a bad move to purchase a home in this financial situation?,"My significant other and I are in our early 30s and have been considering purchasing our first home but we are very unsure as to how to gauge what would be considered affordable without becoming house poor.

We live in a high cost of living state (Hawaii) and have been renting the same place since mid 2020.

Current rent: $1800 + Electric (\~$200)  + Gas stove (\~$40) + Water (\~$80). In terms of rent, it is a very good deal, everything nearby for rent for a similar space and size is easily 2.2k+ at the minimum. Since mid 2020 our rent has only gone up $50/month with the addition of paying for water which we originally weren't. Landlord is great, they are aware we are planning to look for a home and are willing to keep rent the same and roll month to month if we decide to sign/renew a 6 month lease (December - May).

We by chance happened to see a listing for a new build for a home \~$985,000 which is to be finished by the end of the year which includes up to $40,000 in closing costs on the sellers end. Median single family homes here are \~1.1 million and condos \~520k.

Pre-approval for a loan was completed and the estimated rate is ""6.125% at 3.125 points"" after buying down w/ the remaining closing costs. Estimated monthly payments of $5,420 (Principal & Interest $4800, Hazard insurance $150, Real estate taxes $285, HOA $186).

Combined yearly income of \~225k (\~120k + \~105k). Planning to split 50 / 50 for everything.  
Combined \~$11,900 per month after taxes & 403b, but Person 1 only contributing 3% to 403b and Person 2 only contributing 5% to 403b (3% match for both of us).  
Combined $380k in HYSA, \~80k in roth IRA, \~100k in 403b.

Job security is stable. No current health issues. No student loans or debts aside from recurring monthly bills (phone, car insurance, roth IRA contributions, netflix, HBOmax, spotify, amazon prime). Planning to have children in \~2 years.

We are on the fence on committing and worried about ending up house poor in the future after having kids / as HOA fees rise / unsure if we are contributing enough to our 403b to be secure into retirement. We have heard about 0.28 DTI (pre-tax income?) and 50 / 30 / 20 rules (post-tax income?) but am not sure if there are other ways to gauge this situation and would really appreciate some advice or guidance. We have only gone to this one home and haven't checked out / given a chance to looking at other properties which feels silly for such a major life decision. It is likely we end up purchasing a used home/condo if we don't secure this place as there aren't any new developments nearby in the upcoming year. It's just more so that this offer to cover closing costs and it being the last model of it's release left puts the pressure on. This development plans to make a mix of condos/townhouses/homes over the next 9 years but there is no official word of which order/timing of releases.



TLDR;

$985,000 new build home w/ $40,000 closing costs covered on sellers send.  
Planned down payment of 20% (\~200k).   
Loan: ""6.125% at 3.125 points"" after buying down w/ remaining closing costs.  
Estimated monthly payments of $5,420 (principal/interest, hazard insurance, real estate taxes, HOA) before utilities.

Combined yearly income: \~225k  
Combined \~$11,900 per month after taxes & 403b, but Person 1 only contributing 3% to 403b and Person 2 only contributing 5% to 403b (3% match for both of us).  
Combined $380k in HYSA, \~80k in roth IRA (maxed yearly), \~100k in 403b (Person 1 invests 3%, Person 2 invests 5%).

No major debts / loans. Planning to have children in \~2 years. Worried about ending up house poor / costs of children in the future / if we're not currently contributing enough to retire safely and would really appreciate advice or guidance. Thank you so much.",1731860752.0

personalfinance,Camper/RV Loan Advice Needed,"Hi All,

  
I am currently looking to purchase a new 2025 Scout Olympic truck camper. I have a couple of options to purchase this camper, and we wanted to ask Reddit what would make the most sense. Here are a few details of my situation that may determine which route we should take.

  
Camper Cost: $34,000

Savings: $50,000 in 5% APY HYSA (Yields $208/mo - $2,500/yr)

Credit Score: 794

Debt: none besides mortgage all vehicles paid off no student loans.

Costs: $2,000/mo (utilities/mortgage/groceries/gas insurance etc.)

Income: $5,400/mo
  
1) Purchase in full.

2) Finance w/ BECU RV Loan @ a rate of 6.99%.

3) Make a substantial down payment and finance the balance.

  
I am not making any large purchases anytime soon besides possibly this camper. We do not have kids. We each make roughly $100,000/yr each, however this would be funded by just me. Resale value on these things would most likely be around $28,000-$30,000 if sold after 1-2yrs of using it (if we do not like the camper but I would expect to have this for years to come).

  
I've racked my brain, but wanted to get Reddit's thoughts on this.

personalfinance,"trying to rebuild after two injuries killed my career and my savings., and nearly killed me.  ","sorry, this is long. 

hey folks. I could use some help. I'm already beaten down into the dirt, if you could refrain from insulting me, I'd appreciate it.  I'm in pretty bad shape financially. doing my best to claw my way out of it. 

I'm 46. I started out as an art professor, but the pay ($32k in nyc), stress, and job stability was so bad that I moved into doing project management and 3D design for cabinetry, millwork, furniture, and interior design, mostly for high end flagship retail stores. Made about $85k/yr living in NYC. At the time, I was an active alcoholic with severe untreated lifetime depression, so I didn't manage my money well. **I'm now 7 years sober** and working with a good therapist, things are much better but my finances are worse, due to the fact that....

during the pandemic, after being laid off for a year by covid, I got severely injured riding a bicycle. Broke 8 bones, collapsed a lung, had a brain hemorrhage, had 3 surgeries, was on oxygen for 3 months, etc. Took a year to recover enough to go back to work. 

A year after that, I had a traumatic brain injury skiing. The TBI severely affected my vision and brain function, and I am no longer able to work as a project manager or designer, or many other things. I was out of work for almost two years and then initially could only work part time. A couple years later and after spending thousands and thousands of dollars (my entire savings), on treatment for the TBI that wasn't covered by insurance (meaning basically all of it), and after numerous false starts with trying to go back to my old career and various other jobs, I finally have a full time year round job that I can do, working as a maintenance manager for a Property Owners Association. 

fwiw, the brain injury makes decision making very difficult, especially when i'm stressed, which is why i'm here. 

so here's my current situation: 

* 46 yrs old. single, no kids, one small dog. $500 in savings, $1k emergency fund, no retirement, literally no family left except my mom who is 72 and has no savings or retirement besides the $600k house she inherited. 
* Live in a remote mountain town of 2k people. COL is somewhat expensive, but my AA sponsor is here, my therapist is here ($30 a session, basically pro bono), my job is here, all my sober friends are here, etc. I have to go to another town 30 minutes away about once a week for healthcare, groceries, walmart, etc. Moving somewhere cheaper would cost me several thousand and my pay would drop by half. I like it here and would prefer to live here permanently. 
* make $34/hr, about $70k a year, will get a stipend for health insurance, 3 weeks PTO, 10 holidays, IRA with 3% match. flexible schedule. I live 6 minutes from work. 
* starting a second job teaching skiing on weekends at $20/hr in a couple weeks. there is a chance that it will be too much with the TBI and I'll have to quit and focus on my main job. I also live about 5 minutes from this job. 
* Rent is $1250 a month for a 1bedroom during winter. In the summers, I live in a camper on a friends land and pay no rent. 
* groceries are about $400/month. I'm already mostly eating rice and beans, cheap eggs, cheap bulk frozen turkey burgers, and oatmeal, so it would be hard to get this cheaper. I maybe eat out once a month, usually at McDonalds using a deal on the app. 
* car insurance is $200/mo. I shopped around a lot and this is as low as I can get it. I've never had an accident, but I got three speeding tickets last year while visiting my mom on the east coast, just wasn't used to there being cops everywhere. This will get lower next year when my tickets fall off. 
* about $70/wk on gas.
* phone is Mint, it's $50/mo. 
* have a 2020 F150 that is financed. has 100k on it. I've paid about $17k on it so far, currently owe about $16k. 11% interest. payment is $435 a mo. I do need 4x4 and high clearance where I live as it snows a lot and they dont plow much, most of the roads are dirt/mud in summer, etc. I also do haul stuff several times a week for work. I'm trying to sell this but it's difficult because no one wants to deal with paying off the loan and waiting for the title, and I've mostly gotten lowball offers. I would ideally like to get rid of it and get a 90s truck I can work on myself (yes, I actually can, i used to be a mechanic). 
* I recently inherited a 2005 dodge diesel truck that doesn't run. It's prob worth about $15k running, but I need to put about $1k-$1500 into it to get it working again. I'm considering selling the ford and keeping this since I know the truck inside out and how to fix it, and i dont want to deal with someone else's used truck with god knows what problems, but also diesels are a pain and expensive. 
* have three maxed out credit cards due to being out of work and all the medical bills. I paid these off every month before I got injured but now it's out of control. 1 @ $6000, 1 @ $800, 1 @ $3500. 
* $90k in student loans at 6%. in deferment currently. 
* dont have anything else I can sell, except for a bunch of tools in storage that's worth maybe $3k, hesistant to sell these as they are potentially a source for additional income next summer, as I'm a skilled carpenter and those are in demand here at about $35/hr. Not something I can do full time, but part time for additional income is an option. 

Ideally, I'd like to get rid of all my debt and buy a small piece of land and build myself a small house so I never have to move again, but I realize that's a long way off. 

I think that's it. Greatly appreciate any help.

Here's the situation:

US citizen, early 60s, married and living with my Canadian wife as a PR for almost three years. Unable (unwanting) to work for a year until my PR status arrived, slowed by Covid. Mother died in 2022 leaving me about $350K US in an iIRA. Recent IRS rules give me a 10yr window to use the money. Now make over $200K CAD/yr at a corporate communications job so between the exchange rate and tax rate, I'm seeing a lot of this money potentially going away if I use it unwisely. My US advisor (basically my mother's former guy) who manages the iIRA is a little lost about what my Canadian status will have on the funds, so I find myself in a bit of a cross border quandry.

I had a healthy freelance video, design and film composition side business in the US and I'd love to use that money to transition from a corporate gig to a retirement gig that I thoroughly enjoy. Between my wife and I, we have enough but feel like a few more years of prudent earning/investing would position us for a comfortable post-9/5 life.

If I incorporated and built a studio (that could be sold as a studio or ADU) on our property, is there a way to move that money here and use it at a considerably lower rate? Are there other ways to save on taxes? I gladly pay out of my regular salary to support my new home, but for some reason I feel the desire to protect this inherited money as best I can and appreciate any ideas/input to do so.",1731852590.0
personalfinance,To Buy A Used Truck or To Not Buy?,"TLDR: I want to buy a vehicle before the end of year, is it the right move?

I currently drive a 2010 Nissan Altima with 250,000+ miles, I‚Äôve had the car since high school (now 24) and have planned on driving it to 300,000. However, starting last year I‚Äôve began having to put ~$3,000 a year in new parts into the vehicle to keep it running - this is getting costly for me.

I do not plan on selling the car as it‚Äôs paid off, I want to park it at my folks house (they‚Äôre willing to start/drive it when needed, air tires, routine maintenance, etc.) in Tennessee and over the next few years continue putting new parts into it. (I‚Äôm living Florida currently)

I don‚Äôt like and have never wanted to be in debt but the specific type of vehicle I want is a truck. I want a truck because it can be used as a tool for moving, will be safer, and I would be paying cheaper insurance than my current 2-door Altima. I would plan on doing all the regular routine maintenance on the truck as I have with my current car for it to last well over 200k. 

I would like to purchase a truck for ~$25,000 before the end of year as prices are the best for vehicles this time of year. Would this be a bad decision due to the major price point  or should I continue dumping the $3k annually into my car?

I‚Äôd like to pay $10,000 in cash and get a auto loan for the remaining $15,000. I have $0 in debt thankfully, $12,000 in a HYSA that I‚Äôll use for the cash portion, $3,500 in savings, $1,000 in checking, $33,500 in a brokerage account (about $10,000 in cash at the moment), and $22,000 across my 401k and Roth IRA. I also currently make about $80,000 a year and have a 879 credit score.

Would I be making a bad decision to purchase a truck for $25,000? My rationale is the money I‚Äôm spending on my current car would just go into the trucks payment every year. I would also now have a truck I can use as a tool, safer vehicle, and larger for if/when I do have a family. I also have to drive somewhat regularly for work.

My ultimate goal in life is financial freedom and a purchase like this is hard for me to make, but I feel like it‚Äôs a justifiable decision if I‚Äôm planning on keeping the truck for 10+ years, and that I will be paying around the same or $100 more for the trucks payment and insurance versus the $320 monthly insurance payment I‚Äôm making on my 2010 Nissan Altima 2-door.

I thank you all in advance for any suggestions/advice in this situation.

personalfinance,Emergency fund recommendations ,"
Good morning all,

I am a federal worker with small kids who has recently come into some unexpected cash.  I'd like to park it somewhere safe as an emergency fund for the sole purpose of government shutdown(s).  My goal isn't to be political here, but not getting paid for about 45 days was pretty damned uncomfortable in 2019 and that was before I had kids.  I'm confident that I'd still have a job even if they decide to do what they've said in reducing the federal workforce by some crazy percentage because I have a job that needs to get done somehow or bad and newsworthy things happen quickly.  

If/when we shutdown again my goal isn't to remain comfortable, but pay the necessary bills to keep my lights on and food on the table as we belt tighten as this isn't exactly a windfall.  So it needs to be liquid enough to be accessible within a week or so, but while we're at it make some money with it.  

I am thinking a HYSA or just parking it in a bond fund within my existing brokerage account.  I'm totally open to other ideas and that's why I am here.

Yes, I know the need for emergency fund stuff, but due to other life circumstances those have been recently  depleted and have shown us the need for a change.

personalfinance,Considering filing for bankruptcy [Oregon],"Screenshot of my Finances -
https://imgur.com/gallery/b9pbCql
The IRS website is down until tomorrow which is why that is blank. There is at least $1k debt, probably much more. 

I just started a big girl job this week and get my first paycheck next friday, $28.50/hour. Not making a ton but it will be nice to have a consistent paycheck and benefits. However right now everything I make is going to monthly payments, this isn't counting groceries and expenses just to live. My credit score is already low. I already have a nice reliable car, the RAV4, so I won't need a car loan any time soon. I told my partner it sucks I wouldn't be able to buy a house for 7 years but he said ""with this debt would you even be able to anyways??"" Good point. I'll sell the Subaru as soon as I can afford to replace the windshield, get it detailed, and get a mechanic checkup, so that will help with my monthly output a lot.

I have questions regarding bankruptcy, pretty sure chapter 7 is what I want to go with:

- Will my IRS taxes be able to be filed? And will my state taxes be eligible now that they went to a collections agency?

- Can student loans go on there? I'm pretty sure they can't but I thought I'd ask

- I want to keep at least one credit card to pay off and then have for emergencies. And then build my credit back up by putting all my subscriptions on that card and paying it off every month. I was thinking of keeping the Fred Meyer credit card because it has the lowest debt and the lowest interest, however it has the lowest credit limit so if something seriously expensive happens I'm fucked. REI has the best benefits but the highest debt ü´£. The care credit has saved me with my very expensive and sensitive kitty üò© so I'm unsure whether I should put that on or not, though that can only be used for medical stuff.

- PayPal credit will for sure go on, but a maybe slightly unethical question in regards to that. It's not maxed out, so if I plan to file bankruptcy anyways can I max it out paying my taxes or something else down and then file? I've been needing a laptop since my cat peed on mine last year, so I would finally get one.

- any other advice from those who are wiser than me. As you can see, I'm not very financially responsible or disciplined ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò© though a lot of this debt came from not being able to work for 3-4 months after a serious concussion and my cat getting sick right in the middle of all of that, of course the pet insurance came after that.

personalfinance,HSA - Payroll Contribute vs After-Payroll Contribute; How much am I really losing out on?,"I have had a HealthEquity HSA for about 8 years now.  I put the max in each year, and I don't touch it.  It is invested (everything minus 2000 which is the max allowed) in a Target Date Fund (best option I had, don't let perfection be the enemy of the good, etc.).

I have been informed that the partnership in which I am a member\*, will be moving to ThrivePass starting this coming year (2025).  My understanding is everything I had in HealthEquity (8 years and 2 different employers) will remain there.  New contributions, if I elect to go through ""payroll"" deduct, will now go to ThrivePass.  The cost of ThrivePass is $1.10 per month.  (My understanding is HealthEquity has no fee).

My personal situation:

\- Single, no kids/dependents  
\- Make much higher than the SS ""wage base limit""

I've scoured this subreddit and the rest of the internet which seems to think that conventional wisdom says you should do the payroll deduct because you save on the FICA tax.  But if I'm contributing on an after-tax basis, I'm really only losing out on the 3.8% Medicare tax (1.45%+1.45%+0.9%) right?

So on $4300, I'd be losing out on $163.40?  (Minus the monthly fee puts me at $123.2.) But I cam recoup some of that by increasing my ""time in the market"" by contributing all $4300 for the year on 1/1/2025?

\*Extra Credit: For those of you who have already made it htis far and are willing to help me think through this, feel free to ignore this section if it makes things too complex and just answer the questions based on if I were a regular W2 employee.  I'm actually getting this HSA through a partnership in which I no longer have any active activities.  I get a K-1 at the end of the year, but no W2.  I'm guessing the FICA tax would possibly not even be applicable to me since they don't do any withholding, but I'm not 100% sure how that works.

Question 1: Should I maintain 2 HSAs (HealthEquity and ThrivePass), or consolidate into just one?  If so, which one?

Question 2: I'm tired of managing multiple accounts.  If the conclusion is that I'm losing out on much by doing after-tax contributions, is there any world in which it makes sense to transfer my HealthEquity to a brokerage, say Schwab, and contribute after-tax to Schwab from here on out, to consolidate my account to one brokerage (and in the case of Schwab, take advantage of the lower expense ratios)?

personalfinance,Need help with my refinance,"So I‚Äôm at the end of my refinancing process and banking company I‚Äôm working worth has been terrible at responding or giving me any real answers, I want to see if anyone relates to this or does this loan officer just sound like he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing ?

So back in September I started this process and was shopping around for the best interest rates and closing costs, because this is a no money out of pocket refinance, I‚Äôm using my equity I‚Äôve gained in the first year and eight months of living here. 

I really am looking to get this done soon because my reasoning is for just a lower monthly payment and me and my fianc√© just had our first baby and two months not worrying about the mortgage and a lower payment would be huge for us right now 

Anyways back in September I got quotes after they took into account the propertys value, my debt, and my income, from the mortgage companies at 5.25% FHA (my current rate is 7.25% FHA) 


Now with this banking company they claimed to match other companies offers apples to apples. He said and I have it on email they can match the 5.25% FHA or offer a 5.65% Conventional. I decided to work with the banking company and take the 5.65% Conventional. And off course he said they can match it after he ran his number about the property value, my debt, and my income.

Keep in mind I have a 1st and 2nd mortgage 
I have 295,752$ left on the 1st 
I have 9,598$ left on the 2nd
I wanted to combine the two to save on interest 

Now keep in mind now that my appraisal came in at 335,000$

There‚Äôs some room here but no enough to combine them together 

95% LTV of 335,000$ is 318,250$
The new loan amount would be 322,593$ 
Which means I would need to come out of pocket 4,343$

Now the frustrating part is that I wasted all this time for his false promise ‚Äúlocking me in at 5.65%‚Äù when at the start of all this we already had these numbers and he dragged me along through this to say ‚Äú5.65% is still possible if you want to purchase points‚Äù 

No way! That means 1.5% is possible too right! I just need to probably drop 50 grand to buy my way down there ü§£ü§£

Anyway we‚Äôre half way through November and he still hasn‚Äôt given me a rate when he has all the numbers! Funny part too he only responds to my questions on Fridays at 4pm. 

I already did his job and did the math if I remove the 2nd Lein which at this point I‚Äôm going to have to do given the situation I‚Äôm in. It‚Äôll leave me at 93.4% LTV under the 95% LTV cap. 

Call me out on this if I‚Äôm stupid or not. This is a house we don‚Äôt see ourselves in after maybe 10 years. But we‚Äôd love to keep this house to rent it out to someone we can trust. Should I do FHA loan and refinance theoretically when rates go down and my property value goes up? 

Because I live in a housing market where prices are just tending to raise constantly every year and we‚Äôre  up 30,000$ in our first year and half of ownership 

Or should I go with conventional and after 10 years have that PMI knocked off automatically? 

Super hard decision to make but regardless I had my 7.25% rate and a 5% would definitely help our situation right now.

personalfinance,Home equity loan buyout advice,"I might be getting a divorce soon because of my husband's drug addiction. It is not 100% gonna happen, but I want to start preparing mentally and financially in case it does.

I'm still giving him a chance to quit on his own, but if it doesn't happen, I have to move on.

Our house is completely under my name and is paid off. If the divorce happens, I want to keep the house but give him the cash he put into it back so that he can move out and buy another house. He put in $350,000. And I plan on giving him that and maybe a little more if he needs it to buy his new house cash. His credit is bad.

I wont go into detail.about my condition and due to my doctors going back and forth on whose responsibility it was to sign off on my paper work and I passed the timeframe to give them the medical information signed off by my doctor. Mind you my doctors aknowleged I was sick but no one wanted to sign off, they kept saying it was someone elses responsibility and even told me to get a new doctor to sign off. With all the back and forth I got denied and I did try appealing. I did not apply for FMLA because i was so overwhelmed with the back and forth with my doctors, and I feel dumb that I didn't do it but here I am. Finally end of June I got fired because of the denial and in September i got a notice that I owe over 2000 dollars for STD overpayment. Now I'm barely on my feet and I used all my saving to get be through my unemployment period (i didnt get unemployment because they said I didn't try hard enough to keep my, what a joke...). I barley got a new job but it doesn't pay nearly enough to pay it off. 

I did try calling my old employer (its ADP specifically), and asked if they can reduce my balance because it would cause me fincial strain to pay it off by the deadline they gave me which is  December 2024. They put in a request and I finally heard back in mid October and all they said is I'm welcome to go on a payment plan as long as its paid off in full by December. Now I deffinetly can't do that even if I worked non stop because I have rent and need to feed myself. I've tried calling again but I can't speak to anyone who directly handles the overpayments, they told me they just did emails and they put in a request to have someone contact me. I'm worried this will go to collections and ruin my credit because they just aren't getting back to me. What should I do? My mom says I should I just mail them a cashiers check with whatever I can pay every month that way they can't send me to collection but I have no clue if that would work.

I am dabbling with the idea of a home equity loan, but rates are still a bit uncomfortable for me (Navy Fed quoted me at 9%). I tried to make the argument that they are virtually assuming zero risk as my house does not have a mortgage, but they were unwilling to budge on the rates.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation (Possibly HEL/HELOC),"I am looking for advice on consolidating debt and lowering average interest rate. I am married and our annual household income is about $110,000. Our mortgage company estimates our house at just over $400,000 and we currently owe around $235,500. The existing debt consolidation loan was used to pay off various medical debt. Credit Card 1 has been caring a balance for several years from overspending when I was younger and a few unplanned expensive, have already paid off over $4,000 on it this year. I plan on blocking Credit Card 1 and shredding it after it is paid off (I don't want to hurt my credit by canceling it). Credit Card 2's balance is from the last year or so primarily from a trip to visit family across the country (after paying it off I would block it and lock it in our document safe). The Care Credit has been used for various medical, and vet bills the last year and a half totaling aprox $4,000 that has all been paid off. I know addressing the reason for debt is always the first step which I feel we have done, and now I am just trying to consolidate and hopefully address the high interest accounts.

Debt:

Mortgage: $1,750/month at 3.625%

Credit Card 1:  Aprox $7,500 at 24.15%

Credit Card 2: Aprox $7,000 at 18%

Care Credit Card: $0

Debt Consolidation Personal Loan: $16,000 at 27.48%

Camper Trailer Loan: $24,000 at 7.0%

Mattress Firm Loan: $1,726 at 29.99%

Auto Loan: Aprox $40,700 at 7.94%

Monthly Bills (Insurance, Fuels, Utilities, etc.): Aprox $1,060

For just additional information both of our Credit Scores are in the 680-720 range.

Edit 1: I appreciate the many responses. I would say that I feel some of the advice was given after only half reading my post. I have no worries about paying off the current debt as we have already paid off over $4k of the debt this year. I also stated the current consolidation was  to pay off medical bills. Plus a large portion of the debt is from a few years ago when our income was in the $60-70k range and had lower credits hence the high rates. My goal with this was to possibly have a lower average intrest rate and overall pay less intrest.

Edit 2: Just want to summarize we have the abve debt and income. We have no issues making payments, I am just looking at options to pay less interest overall. We have a budget with not many items that aren't bills ( 1 streaming service and a gym membership) and am not looking to sell any items.",1731812659.0

I have a motorcycle payment, but is 2.9% so I really don't care to pay it off early although I could afford to pay it today. It's good to have this auto payment every month right? What I spend in interest I gain in credit?

I also want to open a new CC (amex platinum) that would have a spending requirement to earn the bonus points. Do I put motorcycle on the card and pay card balance then to earn bonus points?

Option 2: sell all properties, this should net about 475000 when all is said and done. Use this to buy a primary residence and have 0 mortgage

Option 3. Rent out all my properties and rent a house in the new city. Spend a year is so till all the construction debt is payed off before I buy a primary residence. Hopefully interest rates have come down and I‚Äôll know the new city a little better.

Checking+bank savings: \~$6000

Investments: $9000 in a Vanguard Roth IRA with a 2025 target date (years ago they put a 3000 in because I hounded them too)

The caretaker pays a reduced rent for mostly keeping the place up. One day I imagine my parent will sell it to pay for end-of-life care but hasn't parted with it yet. Also they have a car that is long in the tooth but all paid for.

Fortunately, they are good about living with in a budget and do not have a credit card.

Expenses:

Housing, utilities, food are covered because they live with me and my kids. They help with childcare and picking up kids from school and occasionally covers the groceries and gas for the cars.

So far medical expenses have been small (post cancer) and only has 2 prescriptions

They have no debt, but cancer wiped out their life savings 5 years ago. Survived but can no longer work a job. My understanding is that disability was not an option because they screwed up with paying social security while self-employed before cancer (something about not having enough quarters paid recently and back paying social security didn't make sense I guess).

Has a term life insurance policy that will end in 2032 and costs \~2,000 year

What are their options? What should I be thinking about as basically their ""retirement plan""

I get ditching the term insurance, I think they thought that it would be helpful to me and my family

At the moment, I am unable to use the card or access the funds, which is all the money I have with me. Is there any way I can retrieve my money or activate the card?",1731800635.0
personalfinance,"mentorship ""scams"" ?","if this isnt the right sub, pls lmk where to go. I would appreciate if you can read and help a young brother out.

For context, I am a full time engineering student interested in financial freedom, but not at the moment. Tbh, I just want good grades, a good masters program, and a job at this stage in life.

2 times now when around campus(city campus), I have had strangers spark up a convo and smoothly but eagerly try and learn about me and whether I am passionate to create a side hustle. 

5 minutes into taking in the target olive oil aisle, right when the guy is about to ask for a way to contact me, I literally shout out if there is any chance I can get your phone number or any sort of contact ;) lol

A few days pass and we meet on the weekend at the same location I met the first person(idk if its coincidence or just the business mentor spot). It starts similar, but better with the second guy bc he's actually also an engineer who works full time at a legit company. 

We talk, he catches my vibe and sees that I am genuinely just a curious kid. He talks about how important financial freedom is and it genuinely was a nice convo apart from the focus on entrepreneurship. However, I feel like there is something slimey about this business thing and mentorship that hes offering without outright saying it.. but he seems to have other mentees. Or maybe i am just a cynic who wont accept some people are nice and helpful.

  
Nonetheless, both times in these meetings, I did not take much out of either of them. They both felt me out, asked what books I read (I used to but don't anymore read business books that repeat the same thing over and over again, a whole lot of nothing), and then recommend a book they send by pdf. This most recent book is cash flow quadrants by robert kiyosaki whom obviously I knew from the past is kinda meh.

  
I search up the book and find [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/j0vvtu/i_think_i_am_being_scammed/) which awfully hit with me bc how similar the situations were. 

My time is not any more valuable than the next guy, but am I just gonna keep running into these guys? Is this a scam or am i just untrustworthy bc how I was raised? I did plan to continue with this guy more for his engineering career rather than his entrepreneurial hustle.

any help or guidance is appreciated, i hope i dont sound like too much of an jaggoff lol.",1731800195.0

personalfinance,Car lease early termination vs. voluntary repo,"I have to leave the US because I got a new job in another country.

I have a car lease with US Bank and have been calling them since I learned about this new job asking them to do an early termination of my car lease (two years left in the lease). However they always tell me that I will have an answer in two business days and to call them then (apparently they need to figure out the price for terminating the lease based on the market price of the car).

This has been going on for over a month now and I find it suspicious that every time I call them they suggest doing a voluntary repo (which would destroy my credit and is not ideal for me since I might come back to the US in the future).

My time is running out and I need to leave the country in a couple of weeks, so I am seriously considering caving and doing the voluntary repo. Would that affect my credit massively or impact my student loan? Has anyone gone through the voluntary repo route before? 

Have also thought about leaving the car in storage and just keep paying the lease for two years, but now sure if that‚Äôs worth it. 

Has anyone gone through something similar. Any advise would be greatly appreciated",1731799793.0
personalfinance,Money Was Returned After Receiving iMac.,"I received my iMac yesterday and today I checked my bank account and the money was returned. I didn't receive an email or anything. Of course I could leave the money there and just wait for Apple to eventually take the money back HOWEVER, I have an appointment on Monday to close the account that I used to pay for the iMac. 

Info as to why I'm closing down the bank account:

A couple months ago I decided to finally separate ""my"" account from my dads account as I'm already an adult and I thought that was settled but a day after I bought the Mac I went to make a deposit and I was informed that my account was still registered as a minor account. I couldn't close out the account that day as the purchase was still pending so I made the appointment for Monday. As I stated above, the money was returned and my dad is impatient so he wants to close down the account on Monday and he told me to keep the money because it wasn't my fault it was returned. However I was planning on setting up Apple Pay on my phone after I get my new account and I was wondering if they do charge me again/take the money back, would it be from the card used on Apple Pay? or would it be taken from my dads account as my current account is under my dads name?

Just incase whatever happens, I downloaded a file of my receipt where it states that they charged my card. ",1731799310.0

Wife and I really want to power pay off **ALL** of our debts over the next few years, but also while doing so start setting money aside into investments to help grow our money instead of it just sitting in our savings.

DEBTS:

* Car: $28,000 (edit: 6.49% interest)
* My Student Loans: \~$17,000
* Wife Student Loans: \~$50,000

We bring home roughly $110,000/year after taxes.

We have $28,000 in savings

I have $16,000 in my TSP, however I would like to transfer it over to my 401k since I am no longer in the military.

I have $2600 in my 401k, this isn't much but I just got out of the military in May so this is really just since then. I match my company with 6% per paycheck. I have also switched my investments to more aggressive funds than what they were as default investments. I also think I may up my contribution to 10%, I don't think I'll really miss the extra 4% out of my paychecks.

My wife has about $10,000 in her 401k.

BILLS per month:

* Rent: $1800
* Gas: $30-$50
* Electricity: $100-$300, ya'll know how electric bills go.
* Car Payment: $445
* Hulu Live: $77
* Storage Unit: $129
* Internet: $68
* Phone: $157
* Car/Renters Insurance: $219
* My Student Loans: No Payment as of right now, will start in Feb 2025
* Wife Student Loans: $300
* Childcare: $650
* Grocery: \~$1,000 (we nearly exclusively shop at Aldi and are usually around $110/week, plus a monthly trip to Sam's Club)
* Gas (for cars): \~$200
* One thing we KNOW we can reduce is eating out. Something so many of us struggle with.

We have a decent sum of money really just sitting in our savings account. I'd like to get it up to an even $30,000 and then take 10 of it to invest, leaving 20K as a safety net.

personalfinance,Thoughts on leasing vehicles as a luxury expense,"I‚Äôd love some thoughts on this - to clarify, I‚Äôm not looking for anyone to confirm my thinking or talk me out of it, I‚Äôm just curious how others would approach this.

My business has done fantastically well in recent years, with my income going from under $30k in 2019 to well over six figures this year and the last few years. I have been cautious to not inflate my lifestyle but at this point I want to spend some of that money on things that I want.

I got my finances together partially by listening to Dave Ramsey, and he is against any way of using a vehicle that does not involve buying it in cash. I think this is great advice for people struggling with money, or if you look at it from a purely practical standpoint.

The big caveat is that I am looking at this as a luxury expense, not a practical expense. I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù a nicer car but I want one lol and I can easily afford it. Practical advice would say that‚Äôs fine, but pay cash. 

My pushback is that I want a new vehicle every few years, and I don‚Äôt view vehicles as an asset because their value goes down so quickly and drastically in most cases. I got burned by buying a $30k used car at the peak of Covid-era used car inflation that is now worth under $15k.

All that is to say, I‚Äôm failing to see the downside to leasing a vehicle under the following assumptions:

1. I have no other debt
2. I am saving and/or investing 25% of my income
3. I have enough cash reserves to pay off the lease and buy a used car cash in a worst-case scenario
4. I understand that this is purely a luxury purchase and the money spent is never coming back to me
5. I don‚Äôt plan on keeping the vehicle for more than three years

personalfinance,All personal financial information compromised - what should I do?,"Hello! This is sort of an IT/personal finance question, but I thought I'd ask it here since you all probably know a lot about protecting your money or may have been in a similar situation. I will probably crosspost to other subreddits.

My place of work was recently the target of a cyber attack. In response, my employer shut down the internet and access to other utilities while they figured it out. When this first happened, they told us they had acted quickly and our personal data was likely not in danger. However, it has been three weeks, they have given us zero information about what is happening, and I am growing increasingly dubious of their ability to protect my financial information.

Here is the information my employer has that could be potentially compromised:

* All personal information (full name, date of birth, social, address, etc.)

*Checking account 

*Retirement accounts (403b and pension)

*Health insurance accounts

*Life insurance

personalfinance,What is the smartest way for me to go about securing a home for parents?,"I'm planning to secure a home for my parents-in-law so that they can live near us which will be a good psychological benefit to them and to my spouse, and will also simplify our lives in terms of childcare in a pinch or caring for them as they age.  I'm trying to think about what makes the most sense for how to actually do this.

Their situation is such that I think they will have trouble securing the mortgage without help.  At their current income, they could probably get the mortgage they need and have a reasonable downpayment for a first-time homebuyer when they sell everything in the old location.  But they will be moving cross-country and needing to find new jobs here.  One of them will be able to get hired immediately given his particular job skills, but the other probably will not get hired right away.  Getting hired late career is no easy feat if you don't have high-demand skills where the employer can't be picky.

Anyway, I'm financially in a position that I can buy this second home without jeopardizing my own finances.  I'm curious if anyone has any ideas or resources that might be useful for understanding this situation better.  Given that they are maybe 10 years from retirement, I'm even trying to consider what makes sense from an estate planning perspective or the asset testing that goes into end of life/nursing home care.

The trust level here is high and financially, I'm comfortable with carrying the house on my books or just helping them get the house onto theirs, but I would not be in a position to just pay cash and let them live there.  If we do this, I'd probably get a mortgage on the place and then figure out the way that makes the most sense for them to contribute to the carrying costs of the house.  I don't need to make money on the house each month, I just would prefer not to treat it as a full blown gift.

The options I'm considering:

* Co-sign their mortgage, they get a mortgage in their name and they own the home

* I buy it with the plan of eventually having them assume the mortgage

* Setting it up as a lease to own where I carry the house with a plan for them to end up owning it via the lease payments

* Buy the house and treat it like an investment property and them like a tenant with no plan for them to ever own the home

Does anyone have any thoughts about how to navigate this situation on the finances?  For the purpose of this discussion, I'd prefer not to hear advice about why I should or shouldn't help them.  That is a lifestyle decision that's already made and now it's just about being smart on the best financial path to achieve it in the areas of minimizing interest costs, maximizing tax benefits, etc.

I was preparing for my credit score to plummet once the account closures hit, but according to Credit Karma, it's actually gone up?

These include a couple of credit cards that I regularly pay off, and a car loan that's currently at a little under $20k.

The only thing I have found is a policy someone mentioned on Reddit pertaining to rollovers. Apparently, retirement plan administrators must make retirement plan accounts accessible by the fifteenth day of the following month once a rollover has been requested/initiated.

I want to stuff another $6k (or whatever the 2024 max is) into a Roth IRA through the backdoor Roth process.

However, after reading about the pro-rata rule (e.g. on [this article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/26/dont-even-think-about-a-backdoor-roth-ira-contribu/)), I'm not sure if I'll be stepping on a landmine by doing the backdoor Roth.

Outside of my 401k, I have a Roth IRA only. I don't have a pre-tax (traditional) IRA.

*Does this mean that I don't have to worry about the pro-rata rule when doing the conversion*? (because I don't have any pre-tax dollars in any IRA to consider as part of that pro-rata formula)

I've only done Roth contributions, then had to stop while I lived abroad for many years with no taxable US income (FEIE'd everything). Never had a non-Roth IRA, much less contributed pre-tax dollars to any.

Given my situation (have a 401k through work that I've completely topped off through pre-tax and megabackdoor contributions), are there any complications of doing the backdoor Roth IRA?

personalfinance,Dual citizenship (American German) and tax/inheritance consequences,"TL;DR - how can I ensure that dual citizenship doesn‚Äôt negatively impact my tax and possible inheritance situation?

_______

I recently learned that I am, technically speaking, a German dual citizen by descent. 

Long story short, under German law if you are descended from a German citizen, under certain circumstances (especially if by paternal heritage) you may be have been born a German citizen without even having known it, and are eligible for a German passport with only a few bureaucratic hoops to jump through, which is my situation. 

While I‚Äôd love to have the benefits of dual citizenship, my biggest questions of course have been around tax consequences. I need to find a tax specialist that is well versed in understanding the consequences of having American/German dual citizenship, particularly around inheritance issues. Both my parents and my spouse‚Äôs parents were very fortunate in life, and as I understand it both of us can expect some kind of inheritance when our parents pass. My spouse has no claim on dual citizenship and is purely American. Both of us are considered fairly high income by American (and German) standards with incomes over $120k, with significant room to grow in the future. 

I did speak to a German immigration lawyer, who said my case was effectively a slam dunk for dual citizenship and ‚Äúin 99% of cases would not effect taxes due to treaties‚Äù but recommended I speak to a specialist to confirm. Of course, I‚Äôd like to ensure I don‚Äôt fall into that 1% of cases where it has negative financial consequences. 

What would be the best path forward in finding someone that can speak to this situation with authority? I don‚Äôt want to leave this to purely internet research, and it seems challenging to find someone with good knowledge on this particular subject from both a German/EU standpoint and American one (I live in the US and up until this point have been purely a US citizen).

personalfinance,Finance a Newer Car or Cash for Older Car,"Hi,

I am looking at getting my first car! I am looking to get a Prius to save on expensive California gas prices. Here are the two options I am considering:

1) Buy an older used car 2009-2013, 130k-180k miles, $6-11k (Pay in cash)

2) Finance a newer used car 2018-2022, 40k-100k miles, $19-23k (Finance  \~7.5%)

  
Alright here is where it gets a little more interesting. If I were to finance a new car I would also look to get a Prius Prime (plug in model). This Prius qualifies for the 4k [used EV tax credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit).  This credit would essentially cover dealer fees and interest payments (assuming a 7.5% APR on $17\~20k, 48 month loan) So in essence I would be taking a 0% APR loan. As someone who likes to invest my money the opportunity cost here seems very enticing. I would be looking to put down like 5K just to bring the total loan amount down.

  
So here are the pros and cons of each option:

1) Buy older used car with cash

Pros:

* No car payments (extra point for mental health lol)
* Cheaper
* Cheaper registration fees
* Cheaper insurance

Cons:

* Higher maintenance costs (not sure how to attach a dollar amount to this, plz help!)
* Lower resale value

  
2) Finance a newer used car

Pros:

* 4k tax credit
* My work has free EV charging
* Less maintenance
* Having a newer car is nice lol
* Car loan is good long term for credit score

Cons:

* More expensive
* Higher registration fees
* Higher insurance costs

  
TLDR: Should I buy a cheaper older car for cash or finance a newer used car at 0% APR b/c of a tax credit.

If nothing major happens, might start tossing extra in from savings once payments resume but idk if it's a good plan.

District I've recently moved to has a lot of quality takeout. On average, it costs $15 if you're buying a vegetarian dish, plus $6-7 if you want boba.

personalfinance,Lost all savings trading and feeling lost in life ,"I'm 48 years old, I have a serious options trading addiction, and have lost loads of money over the years. Just yesterday night I sat and went through yearly statements and realized I have lost $424k since 2011. I just didn't realize I have lost that much, and the fact that if I had invested them in index funds I could even be up double that . Those thoughts and the fact that I only have $50k in savings at this age crushes me. 
I graduated from a top 10 college, all my college friends are now multi millionaires and am at this sorry state.

My wife has $600k saved and we are were planning to buy an house next year with $300k down. We split the finance 50:50, so I would have to put down $150k. My wife doesn't know of my loses and she would absolutely leave me if she comes to know . We have 3 kids. Coming clean to her is not an option. 

I make $160k at my job and can save around $4k per month going forward. At 48 years, I can't see a meaningful way to find a way to save $150k by next year and most importantly how do I get to retirement from such a life full of terrible financial decisions(I don't even have retirement accounts), is it possible to recover from this?


I have stopped trading a month back. I guess am here to see if anybody have stories of a turnaround at such a late age and what else should I be doing financial from now on.  I feel like such a failure in life. ",1731764932.0
personalfinance,What to do with a car accident settlement?,"Someone somewhere on Reddit once said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt get to pick how windfalls come to us‚Äù and I certainly never wanted a windfall this way, but I will be receiving a settlement from a car accident I was in leaving me with very significant injuries.  I am working because I love my job but it‚Äôs incredibly painful, and I‚Äôm getting through the day with pain meds.  My husband and I want to have kids and my doctor recommended I take a leave of absence from work for my whole pregnancy.  I do have disability insurance so as long as my doctor signs off on it I can still get close to my monthly salary while on disability, but being new to my job, my union rep said I can really only be out from about month 5ish to 3 months post pregnancy.  Ok so with all that background info:

- settlement will be $165k.
- we are currently buying a house with a $525k loan and 6.5% interest rate.
- monthly mortgage payment is about $4500 and my husband and I take home $11k a month after retirement, insurance, ect
- we have no other debt, but our cars are a 2010 ford truck and a 2015 Mitsubishi lancer
- my husband will also receive a settlement for having to care for me through multiple surgeries
- we have health insurance that has a policy they will not assert a lien on our settlement

Since I will be able to collect disability, does it make sense to just keep paying the house and invest the whole settlement?  Make investments in the house (like use maybe $50k towards the house and invest the other $100k, and use $15k for other life things).  So we put the whole thing towards the house to refinance the monthly payment down, or possibly try to switch to a 15 year mortgage vs 30?

* Pension that will pay ~4.5k/month

personalfinance,Shorter or longer term HELOC if not planning on staying in house,"So long story short, my spouse and I were rather reckless with credit card usage between life/wedding/hospital expenses and we're in the hole pretty badly. To about the tune of $70,000 or so. 

As a last ditch effort to relieve some of the crushing interest (only on 1 income) my idea is to take out a fixed rate HELOC on the house (which has a mortgage about halfway paid down). This will allow me to get everything financially back on track at a much lower rate, SHRED and cancel all but 1 credit card, and actually have spare money at the end of the month to save/pay down extra/vacation/etc. The options are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years. Adding to this, we are not planning on staying in this house since it's very much a starter home in size, ideally within the next 2-3 years we want to sell and find a new one to move into to raise a family. 

So that being said, which length should I do for the HELOC? Generally I know the shorter term is better, you pay less interest overall even if the amount per month is higher. However, given that we are planning on selling in the near future, would it be better instead to do a longer term like 30 years for lower monthly payments now? Either way the remaining mortgage and heloc get paid off once a sale goes through, and I could use extra money in my pocket each month now vs realizing a bit more back later on when a sale goes through. 

Any opinions? Not really looking for other alternative financing options, just which length would be better to do. Thanks. ",1731751371.0

My new job is not even half the salary of my previous one making around $95,000/year with bonuses. I have changed all spending habits and changed my mentality after the lifestyle creep. CC have all been cut up and placed on holds. Once balances are all paid off I plan to close the cards (only ones with high AF that no longer serve a purpose as I am not traveling like I used to). 

I am going to be getting a $10,000 end of the year bonus from my job soon and I am trying to figure out where to put that extra cash. I am currently doing the debt snowball to pay off the lowest balance first but wondering if this is the smartest move. 

  
numbers are approximate

2 - $4,000 - 27.74%

3 - $6,000 - 28.49%

4 - $9,000 - 28.74%

5 - $14,100 - 28%

Earlier this year I got laid off from my work, and they sent my 401k balance to PenChecks recently. It wasn only sub 5k since i didn't personally contribute to my 401k, and Penchecks didn't automatically roll it over to an IRA. They said they have the check waiting for me.

I was wondering if I could still put this check into a rollover IRA? Or is it too late?

If still possible, can I contribute to the rollover IRA since I had income for the first couple of months of this year?

Few days later and before receiving the card in mail, they‚Äôve sent me an email stating **On behalf of Discover Card, Equifax Verification Services has sent you IRS Consent Form 4506-C to Sign** requesting access to my last 2 tax returns which seems to be common based on a few searches. 

I called them and stated I don‚Äôt have any tax returns yet, so they asked me to send **last 3 bank statements** instead, before Dec 27 instead to avoid account closure. I tried asking the agent why they needed this, and they said it‚Äôs to **verify identity**. I also tried to ask if putting my dad‚Äôs income was the issue but they didn‚Äôt seem too bothered about that. 

I‚Äôm now coming across a few posts that state that putting my father‚Äôs entire $140k income was actually not a good idea, but now that I‚Äôve already done it, I‚Äôm wondering if I should:

a) call them again, say that I had a misunderstanding and ask them to modify that number, or

b) just provide the bank statements and hope they‚Äôre trying to only **verify identity** as they‚Äôre claiming?

c) simply close my account and apply for something like the Chase Freedom Rise instead?

personalfinance,Just turned 18 and my dad signed me up (without my permission) for four credit cards,"*UPDATE: I canceled the discover student credit card, I sent an email to Self to cancel whatever tf is going on, though I'm worried because it's already connected to my bank of America account (read below). He's insisting that I get the discover card, a Chime card, and take out a secure loan from ESL. He says that Self is a prepaid loan which checks out, but I still am upset he did all of this without asking me.* ***To clarify: he did not actually sign me up for four. That's what I thought he did. He signed me up for 2 things without asking: Discover and Self. His plan is to get me a discover student credit card, continue using Self for a loan which you get the money back for, open a Chime card for me, and take out a loan to be paid over 6 months at ESL.*** *He says Chime is 0 risk, that he'll pay the difference for the ESL loan, and Self will give the money back in 2026 as 1,000 dollars. The only risky thing I see is Discover, however if i link that to my own bank account (see below), I think I should be ok. I declined the application which is good, so that if i change my mind, i can log in with my own info... but if hes already made an account and everything, idk... I feel that many people here are overreacting a bit, but I do agree with some of the sentiments. I know my dad and know that he can be pushy, so I'm setting boundaries. I can tell that he really does want to help, but I'm worried he's not going to be able to make some of the payments (like for Self) thanks to his poor financial circumstances.*

I know it's important to build credit, but waking up on my birthday to an email saying my application for a Discover student credit card was received was not what I was expecting. He also signed me up for Self (no idea what that is), and is demanding that I sign up for Chime and another credit card for my personal bank account I use for work.

Here's the other thing--I have a bank of America account, and he's using it for his own work deposits/withdraws. It's essentially an account in my name that he's using. We made it when I was 17, so I guess he legally has access, but I'm worried about having someone else's paychecks and what have you in an account under MY name.

My father does not have a good credit score and has gone bankrupt multiple times. Apparently he knows what to do though, because he's ""taken multiple classes,"" and to be truthful, I do believe he helped improve my stepmom's credit score immensely.

I'm not sure what to do... I canceled the Discover student credit card application, I have no idea what Self is so I'll have to look into that, and tomorrow he's gung ho on getting me signed up for Chime and a credit card with my other bank account that he does not have access to (at least for now...). For now the only credit card I want is with my own bank account. I know people get more as time goes on, but 4 at once seems like overkill, and I don't want him in control of that.

I'm afraid that he's using my own name/bank account/cards for his own personal use because he can't due to financial instability. I don't expect him doing bad with the cards, but also, I don't really want to have 4, and I don't want him touching my stuff, and I want to do things myself, and for the love of God I do not want anyone signing me up for things without my knowledge in MY name!!!",1731731989.0

*automoderator made me take out $ amounts and other helpful details,  but let me ask my question anyway!*

  ------

I have been confused about this for some time. I traded in and out of crypto at a gain from 2019-2022. I got wise to taxes and logged my transactions to pay backtaxes for that bull run in 2023. 

I sold at a significant loss to cover the backtaxes. My tax guy didn't take this loss into consideration and I didn't know any better, so I sold and wrote a check which amounted basically to my entire balance given the lower asset value.

 It was pretty traumatizing and I wrote the check after minimal research. I also don't know enough to tell if my tax guy did a bad job or a great job. My only other second opinions were coinly and HR block which aren't really the sharps either.

  I'm wondering, now that I'm feeling more grounded.... is there some way I can claim a loss or something to regain some of my cash losses, or file an amendment? Is there any way or hope that an amendment could gain me some sort of a refund from the IRS and my state DOR? I sold at the end of 2023.

  Can you all give me some advice on selling at a huge discount compared to where my taxes were being calculated? I really don't understand this stuff and I think my tax guy could have helped me more. Any help is appreciated a lot.

I have approx $3600 (26.74% APR) on a Chase credit card, $2600 (18% APR) on a Navy Federal card, and $575 (17.35% APR) owed on a personal loan.

The school debt is $9000 and I currently have a payment plan to pay $150 monthly over 60 months and it does not count towards my credit. Until the debt is paid in full, however, there's a hold on my account and I can't enroll at any public college or university in my state or get an official transcript sent to another institution.

I work full time and bring home approx $2600 monthly after taxes, the overwhelming majority of which goes to paying my rent+utilities of $1640, which I'm aware is way out of living within my means. I then pay \~$124 monthly towards the loan (usually more when I can) and approx $400 cumulatively towards my credit card balances.

My main goal in the moment to move in with roommates and thus reduce housing expenses, but that does require decent credit for apartment applications (>680) which is the norm where I live and work, and the money to move in the first place. The school piece is more of a longer term goal atp, but I still want to keep it in mind.

*The options I'm considering:*

My first thought was to take out a personal loan with my credit union where I currently have a loan and consolidate all of my debt there, but even though at a max 18% APR it would help with the credit card stuff, I'm concerned that this decision would hurt when it comes to the personal loan (unless I take from my savings and pay that off immediately) and school debt.

I'm also considering after reading this subreddit is to possibly apply for a low APR credit card and do a balance transfer of the credit card debt, but wouldn't necessarily solve the school debt issue, and I don't know if I could realistically pay off $6200 over 12 months before a low APR deal ends.

If anyone has any ideas or guidance to offer about how I can approach my situation and any glaring red flags I'm not considering I'd really appreciate it. Maybe I need to do a combination of the above ideas or there's an avenue that I'm unaware of, but regardless I'm aware I haven't made amazing financial choices in the past when it comes to spending and credit, but I'm hoping to make better choices now.

* The ESPP allows you to purchase shares of publicly traded company stock at a 15% discount
* Funds will be deducted from your paychecks over the next six-month offering period (Jan 1- Jun 30)
* At the end of the offering period, the shares are purchased
* You can contribute up to 10% of your pay (Annual max. contribution is $25k or 1,000 shares per offering period)
* After the purchase, you may sell or hold the stock

28M with annual household income of $250K

Currently max out my traditional 401k at work for a total of ~$30K per year when including my 4% ($8,000) employer match. It is 100% invested in the S&P 500 index. 

Our income prevents my wife and I from directly contributing to a Roth IRA. I am completely aware that the Backdoor Roth is a possible solution. 

That being said, we are currently contributing around $4K per MONTH into an after-tax brokerage account in addition to my traditional 401k. Basically, much more than the $7K annual Roth IRA limit. 

Most of the brokerage investments are dividend ETFs, REITs, income focused investments, etc with the goal being early retirement and passive monthly income. 

I realize that the brokerage account is less tax efficient, however, I am willing to pay more in taxes and invest a lot more money in my brokerage account if it means I can access my money whenever I want and have no restrictions placed on my money by Uncle Sam. I don‚Äôt want everything tied up in a retirement account.

My take home after taxes is about $41,000. Have about 10% going into a Roth 401k with an employer matching 3%. Have about $8000 in savings across various places. Currently searching for a good HYSA. Wife‚Äôs take home after taxes is about $35,489. Her employer adds about 8% of her income to retirement on top of her take home. Has about 15k in savings (13k of which was a refund from school which she plans to pay straight back to the lender).

No House Mortgage or Rent. (Living with my Parents) 

No Phone Bill for either of us (Still paid for by parents) 

Wife waived all Health Insurance as she is on her parents plan until 26y/o

**Plans / Ideas:** 

1: Aggressively pay off these debts using the Avalanche Method while living with my parents 

2: Potentially look into my wife applying for an IDR to reduce minimum payments so we can put more towards the highest interest loan or pay minimums until Loan Forgiveness. Haven't found a solid answer on how exactly the forgiveness aspect of the IDR works. 

3: Extending the Terms of the low interest rate loans and putting the minimum payments saved towards the high interest loans to pay them off quicker. 

4: PSLF as she works for a Non-profit school. Paying off my car first as student loan interest is tax deductible

The cost in question occurred in about 2020. It was not during my tenure with the most recent HSA administrator (WEX) which started around 2023. 

I did some research and it says any cost that was incurred while the account was open is eligible for reimbursement. Where I‚Äôm confused is if that means the inception of my HSA account generally (2019) or the start of my current HSA account at my current job (2023). When switching jobs, the money has always been transferred directly from HSA to HSA.

personalfinance,[Question] Retirement Withdrawal: How to be most Tax Efficient between different accounts?,"* Already Retired, currently 68 years old, filing single
* Current income (~40K/yr): Social Security Benefits (~27K/yr,) Pension (~8K/yr), HYSA bank interest (~5K/yr), this is enough to pay all the bills
*  Investments Accounts: Traditional IRA (401K Conversion) at ~200K, Roth IRA, Taxable Brokerage ~200K.

As I don't need any of the investment money right now, I am wondering is it worth it to do small IRA conversions from traditional to roth every year, just to get the money out of pre-tax and to lower the RMD withdrawal in a few years and the growth will grow tax free from this conversion, and my current  income will be the lowest it will ever be because of no RMDs. If so, any rule of thumb on how much should be converted to be most Tax Efficient?

My understanding is the taxable income is 13.5K (half of social security)+ Pension/HYSA interest (13K) =26.5K. So social security benefits will be taxed as it's greater than 25K regardless, as dividends from the taxable brokerage is not considered yet. Do I just base this off the general income tax brackets?  Based on my taxable income calculation,  I am at 26.5K, which means I am in the 12% tax bracket (this bracket is up to 47K in income), is it most tax efficient to do the conversion to bring my taxable income up to 30K or 40K in case to keep myself in that 12% tax rate?

Am I overlooking anything else when considering making this decision?",1731692695.0
personalfinance,Start new job now or wait until 401k fully vests?,"Hi everyone,

I'm facing a decision and could use some advice to figure out which option would be best for. I recently received a job offer from a competing company with two possible start dates: **January, 2025**, or **June, 2025**. The new job comes with a 50% raise in base salary: 80k->120k.

At my current company, my 401k will fully vest on June.. by then this will amount to around $14k in only **employer contributions.**

If I start my new job in January and try and recover by maximizing my contributions, I will still be 5k behind by June.

This is where I'm at a predicament.

Is it worth waiting to start a new job for 5k in a 401k?

On one hand, im in my early 20s so I feel like that 5k have potential to grow into a sizeable amount by the time I retire.

On another hand, it might be best for my career to start the new job as soon as possible...

Can she in theory, move that money back into a traditional IRA, then back into the Roth to have it count as a back door? Or is the process ruined by putting it into the roth account first.

personalfinance,IRAs as a foreigner in the US,"Some background info: I have a 401k through my employer and currently, I do not max out my contributions. I am not a US citizen and don't plan to immigrate or retire here. From my research on reddit, the general consensus for my country nationals in the US is to have traditional IRAs over roth (to take tax savings now rather than later) since my country will likely also tax withdrawals of a Roth IRA. My Federal AGI for 2023 was \~72k and it will be higher this year since I only started working in July 2023. This means that I will exceed the 87k AGI limit for 2024 resulting in no deductions. 

I want to hear feedback from this sub on my thoughts about having IRAs in my situation. My thought process is to open a traditional IRA (which will be non-deductible), basically treat it as a brokerage account for now; and when I leave the country, roll-over my 401k investments into it, and maintain the account.

personalfinance,How to prepare for a minor future windfall?,"Throwaway alt for all the security reasons...

Hi all,  
I (47 yo) have a reasonably substantial holding in a pre-IPO startup. I think the IPO, in \~18 months ish, should land at around $15, which would be a gross sale on my side of just north of $1,000,000. I've held the exercised shares from my ISO plan for many years, so this would be capital gains (I think\*). Our typical family yearly income is around $350,000.

What is the best way to plan out how to allocate the proceeds? We have a 10 year old to plan a college savings for, I think we've got about one year of an upmarket (but not Bennington) school in our higher ed savings plan as of now, and anticipate the combined grandparents kicking in around another $50k or so. My spouse is looking at a pension of north of $100k/yr, and we have additional retirement savings, which while not meager aren't enough to do whatever the hell we want. We're tracking normal retirement years (63-67) as of now, due mostly to the pension vest requirements for maximizing the payout.

Additionally, I am now employed at a rocketship style startup, a real market darling, and could potentially have a second future windfall that puts another zero on what I might see from the first.

All in all, kind of a complicated situation taking everything into consideration at once. Before I talk to a financial advisor, I'd like to take the pulse of the kind folks here for some general guidance.

Thanks

\* I was recently informed of some sort of penalty for not holding \_unvested\_ shares that complicates the tax calculations. This was from a SmithBarney investment team that did an equity comp presentation for my company. They claim, and again I have never heard of this before, that the maximum tax benefit is accrued when you hold unvested shares for 12 months, exercise, and hold the exercised shares for an additional 12 months. For the shares I'm discussing here, I held many for more than 12 mo prior to exercising, but when I left the company I had to exercise everything I had vested or the options would have expired. This was ca. 2018, and I had vested shares for the prior 4 years. Sorry for the complication but there it is.",1731691314.0
personalfinance,I‚Äôm a 19 year old how am i doing so far,"
Hello, Reddit! I am a 19-year-old who started working full-time at the beginning of this year and decided to focus on improving my finances. I began investing my money in early October and wanted to share my progress with you all. I‚Äôd love to hear your opinions and get some constructive criticism.

I‚Äôve learned a lot from reading other posts on this subreddit, and I personally think I‚Äôm on the right track. However, I‚Äôm eager to gain more knowledge and continue improving.

So far, my current goal is to prioritize maxing out my Roth IRA every year. Once that‚Äôs done, I‚Äôll shift my focus to investing in ETFs on Robinhood. In my Roth IRA, I currently have around $6,000, which I‚Äôve allocated as follows: FXAIX - 60%, FSPTX - 20%, FTIHX - 10%, and FXNAX - 10%. I think this split is fairly good, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions for improvement.

On Robinhood, I have about $3,500 invested, split between VOO, VTI, and GLD.

I also learned that having an emergency fund is an important step, so I set aside $10,000 in a 12-month flexible CD..

Why I can't save any money. 

Hi this is my first time posting to reddit for advice, I'll just run you down. I work a retail (kinda) based job and I make 15$/hr with tips (per week ranging 40-75$) work 38-41 hours. Live in 1bd apt with boyfriend who makes 19$/hr, works labor intensive job, pays for all the bills but we split rent at 450$ each. He works 38-43 hours depending on the week. 

We both have the same pay period and are full time. When his deposit hits, it's between 1000-1350 respectively and if I'm lucky I make between 790-900 a deposit (tips are done in cash and separately)

We both have a car we share and are co-owners on. This is the second car we bought within our savings in the last 5 months due to our first car we bought getting totaled in a crash just around 4 months of having the car but I need a vehicle for my job, he doesn't, so he had to get another asap so I could return to work. I pay for insurance for both cars because again I'm the one who needs the vehicle for my job and he essentially paid for both cars with his savings while I paid him back over time through other expenses (groceries, gas, etc)

Even with his help, I can't seem to catch up. He has done all the bulk spending to help me get to my job and help me live and asking for anything else causes more burden on our relationship on top of the financial stress.

personalfinance,House is paid off -- would you move right now?,"Tl;Dr: my husband would prefer a new home to remodeling the one we have. What would you do in this economy?

We fully own our house built in 1984. We've put a lot of time and effort into making it a home including new insulation, new floors, all sorts of new things to make it better and nicer. 

But the one thing that we cannot add or change is the amount of space and the bathrooms. They are small and a constant source of frustration for my husband because we do not really have a ""master suite.""

We also have a considerable plot of land for the area. Only 3/4 of an acre but it's three times as large as most of the lots in our neighborhood. 

Anyway, we paid off the house earlier this year but my husband appears to be getting stir crazy..

We could afford a new home even with a ridiculous interest rates these days, but I'm mixed on whether or not it is ""worth it.""

For reference, homes around here at the size we're looking at are going from anywhere from $350,000 to $700,000.

We could likely spend half of the cost of the kinds of houses that we're looking at and put an addition on our house. But, it would likely mean we couldn't live in it for a period of time while that was happening. This is all just spitballing we haven't gotten any designs or contacted a contractor or anything like that. The home being two story is also complicates things because the addition would have to be both stories as well.

When I bought this house I ensured that I could do it by myself because at the time we were not married yet. We both work in tech so I am very wary of one of us being laid off with no warning and taking on a huge investment when we don't absolutely 100% need to seems silly. But it would be nice to have a larger space to raise our family and be able to support both of our sets of parents as they age.

We have a considerable emergency fund and we've been saving all of the money that we used to be paying for the mortgage this past few months. So we're doing really well all things considered.

personalfinance,Determining how to tackle my student/car loans as I start my first job out of college,"I'm moving across the country to start my first job out of college in a few weeks and am looking for some advice on how to tackle my budget/loans/retirement. I checked out the flowchart in the Wiki and tried to make a decent plan to tackle my finances.

**Loans (\~$43k)**

* $6k in car loan
   * 5.24% interest rate
* $37k in student loans
   * 2.75% to 3.75% for private loans
   * 2.75% to 5.5% for federal loans (mostly unsubsidized)

**Financial Situation**

* $16k currently in high-yield savings account
* $70k salary
   * $4k sign-on bonus
   * 5% to 401k to max out company match
   * $25 per paycheck to HSA

  
My current plan is to pay off my car loan (i know the interest rate is less than my larger federal loans) with some of the money I have in my HYSA, and leave the rest as an emergency fund ($10k). So that will get rid of my monthly car payment. Then, hit minimum payments on my student loans ($430 per month) which will set me up to have them paid off by 2034 :/. Then basically redirect what I was paying for my car loan to my Roth IRA (\~$250). Combining this with the budget I made, my expenses would be pretty much equal to my post-tax income. 

Given I haven't moved yet and really don't know how my budget will shape out, I'll probably hold off on contributing to my Roth for the first month or two to get a better feeling of what my budget looks like. Additionally, trying to furnish an apartment and everything that goes along with that. But ultimately, the goal would be to put any leftover money into my Roth. 

Does this plan seem like a solid way to tackle debt/retirement? I'm definitely open to any suggestions or feedback. Ultimately, I would like to pay off my loans as quickly as possible, but also realize that contributing to retirement is important.

personalfinance,"Need advice for fixing my retirement plan investments. I don't know where to start. Help, please?","I apologize in advance for being this clueless at my age, but please if anyone can give me some advice, it's be greatly appreciated.

I worked for my ex-employer for a little over 8 years. I believe by the 2nd year they offered a ROTH IRA plan, and then about a year or two later, they upgraded our benefits to offering 401K plans. They matched 100% of our contributions up to 3% of our salaries, and then matched 50% above that if we contributed 5% of our salaries.

Currently, I'm working for a smaller company that does not yet offer those types of retirement plan benefits, so I'm looking to start investing up to 10% of my salary personally.

I should have acted on this situation sooner, but some things in my life have taken all of my attention. With a baby on the way, I want to make sure I have this all sorted out. I'm not sure what my next step should be or even can be.

It looks like the person who had a contract with my old company to handle retirement benefits is no longer in charge of that. I used to receive mail from Capital Group with updates, and now I've started to receive mail from Voya regarding my account. I assume that means accounts have been transferred or sold(?) to another company to manage? It doesn't appear like I can just start contributing to this account anymore since I'm listed as terminated from that old employer (I quit), or am I wrong about that? I don't think I'm wrong...

So, if I can't contribute to that account, I start a new account, right? If I'm doing it personally (as in not through an employer), do I start a new ROTH account? How do I go about doing that? Do I contact Voya, or should I go through someone else? Do I leave my old 401K plan alone, or do I roll it over into a new account? Will I lose any investment that way?

I wish I was more financially literate, but I need some help here. Again I appreciate any advice.",1731687212.0

I'm writing from an alternate account, this is how terrified I am of anyone knowing how much I owe in CC Debt.

I'm 41 married with two young kids. I wake up every night at 3-4 am, overwhelmed with guilt and shame at how I've allowed us to get into this hole. I have been reading post from this account for a few weeks but first time posting.

I make 80k and my husband makes similar 70-80k (he's hourly so fluctuates but at tax time it's usually similar to my income)

We owe $70k in CC Debt. 25k in personal loan. (poor choice in paying off debt and did what was predictable-accumulated cc debt in addition to loan) 7k in car loan (0% interest and will be paid off next year). This debt originated from 2020-2023. Won't get into why we are in this much debt but I have done a lot of work to shift my mindset around money and addressing it now. We've always had CC debt, but it's always been just a card or two and we come out of it. Never have we ever been in a hole like this and I am terrified.

As of right now I am following the 'Get out of Debt' by Erin Skye Kelly. She recommends an emergency fund which I have at 5k. I have depleted and filled this account a few times due to car problems, dental visits, vet bills, house issues, etc. but have managed to not accumulate new CC debt since starting her program. I am also in therapy and have really done a money 180. I am a lot better with impulse shopping and sticking to a budget compared to years past.

However, I am feeling so overwhelmed. I am working a 2nd job and all of that money goes to replenish my savings and/or pay off a CC, however the work is not consistent month to month but I am really trying to get more work when I can. My husband also works overtime as much as he can as well and this really helps with paying the minimums per month. 

For monthly expenses, we have internet, cellphones, car insurance, life insurance, kids after school activities (150-200/mo) and a few streaming such as Disney, Netflix, and Peacock. The usual household bills, oil and electricity. I try to shop at Aldi's when I can but due to time constraints (it's 30 min away) I will shop what's on sale at supermarkets in town. We do order out on Friday nights but I we decided from here until after Christmas we will not go out to eat to save that money for Christmas costs. With our take home pay we are paying those household bills and all of the minimums but there is barely anything extra to pay off the CC. 

I am feeling so stuck. The interest rates are so high (18-29%) that I can't seem to dig myself out. I have called to lower interest rates but most of them say I have to apply through a credit agency. I am hesitant to do this b/c I've read how they're not always helpful in the long wrong. I am going to try again to call all of the CC and see if they will lower their interest rates.

I live in a mid-to-high COL area. I'm a design engineer in a very stable sector, and I make a bit over 90k USD, pre-tax. I have \~18k in my checking account and \~10k in my retirement accounts. I'm living with my folks and have no living expenses. I have 20k in student loans at 4.5%-5% interest and 25k remaining in car loans (additional details disclosed below).

I have a 2024 Toyota Corolla LE with a base price of $23,000, 4.75% APR, financed for 48 months with a total loan amount of $28,000, and I‚Äôm trying to determine if refinancing will affect the principal amount due. The financial advisor at my car dealership encouraged me to pick 48 months (with an associated total payment of 28k), and suggested I can refinance at any time -- I took this to mean that the total amount due would change with restructuring the loan terms, but I'm not sure if that was an accurate assumption.

I'd appreciate advice on my best options.

personalfinance,529 Plan Distribution for K-12 tuition,"Hello, I do not qualify for the state tax deduction for 529 contributions in my state, so I am happy to look at 529 plans for other states. My goal is to superfund contribution for my child and then withdraw $10k per year once said child starts attending kindergarten at a private institution. I know this $10k is considered a qualified expense for federal tax reasons, but different states vary. Now my question is, do I want to select a states plan that considers this distribution qualified expense or does it not matter if I live in/file taxes in a state that doesn‚Äôt consider it qualified? Ie let‚Äôs say I like in NY. NY doesn‚Äôt consider k-12 a qualified expense for 529 so if I withdraw, the earnings would be subject to NY state tax and 10% penalty.

personalfinance,I disputed a charge with Wells Fargo and got denied.,"I got approved for a Wells Fargo credit card back in September, but I never received the card in the mail. Then, I noticed in my Wells Fargo app that there was a $400 purchase at Home Depot in a town I‚Äôve never been to. I called Wells Fargo to report this, and they refunded the amount and sent me a new card with a new number.

However, I recently saw that the $400 charge has been added back to my account. I called Wells Fargo again to figure out what‚Äôs going on. Their fraud department informed me that the original card was activated using my phone number, so the charge was reinstated. (I never activated the original card since I never received it, and I have no idea how this could have happened.)

I also called the Home Depot where the purchase occurred and spoke with someone there. They told me the $400 purchase was for gift cards. They even sent me a photo of paperwork showing that whoever made the purchase had tried to use two other cards first, both of which were declined, before successfully using my card.

Wells Fargo said they would get back to me within 48 hours. However, they seem to think I made the purchase since the card was activated using my phone number. Lately, I‚Äôve been receiving strange spam calls and texts, which I don‚Äôt respond to, but I‚Äôm worried this might be connected.

I‚Äôm concerned that I won‚Äôt get the $400 refunded. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!


UPDATE #1: sorry i didn‚Äôt mean to put dispute. This was reported as fraud but was ultimately denied and i was still charged $400. I‚Äôm gonna do most of what everyone has suggested in the comments.

This probably means that my number was spoofed(?).

personalfinance,Balancing pay down mortgage vs financing a car,"My wife and I just sold our old house and finally have a decent chunk of cash. We were hoping to refinance the mortgage on our new home, but rates went back up to what they were when we bought (just over 7%) so refinancing isn't an option right now. We can take the proceeds from the sale of our old house and pay down some of the new principal (using something called a recast), reducing our monthly payment, but we'd be keeping the 7.1% interest rate.

We are also in the market for a new car. We can easily buy the car we want with cash, that would just leave less to pay down the principal on our mortgage. We could finance the car through the dealership (2.9% up to 36 months, 3.9% up to 60 months, 4.9% for 72 months). I understand that generally you want to pay down higher interest debt first. So should we just put down the minimum on the car and pay off as much of the mortgage principal as we can? Could someone help me with a formula so I can plug in the numbers to compare scenarios where we pay off more of the mortgage vs down payment on the car to try to optimize?

We already have an adequate emergency fund and are maxing out our retirement contributions, so those don't need to factor into the question.",1731679477.0

Option 3: Take the loan and leave after a year.  This is where I'm not too sure.  The loan might be prorated where part of it is forgiven for the year there.  Another question is if this loan has an interest rate of 6% and she has student loans at 8% and credit card debt, does it make sense to take the sign on loan and pay off the higher interest debt?

personalfinance,31 need some advice - Australia,"

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm looking for some general advice and help with budgeting as I am 31 and always been terrible with saving. 

I‚Äôm an engineer, 3 years into my career and just got a new job where I‚Äôve jumped from 90k/year to 130k/year (plus super) - with HECS I‚Äôm netting about $7,300 a month. 

I started my career kind of late and at 28/29 on my first salary I was living in Melbourne and wanted to enjoy having a non-hospitality job and salary so I did not live frugally. I recently moved back to the Gold Coast and had unfortunate car troubles which took all my savings. 

As I have just had a considerable jump in wage, I feel like I am in a position where I can start saving properly and feel like I am quite behind. 

My current financial scenario is:
- 7,300 a month
- $500/week rent
- 10k credit card debt
- 60k HECS debt
- I need to buy a new car and drive about 500km a week
- I am looking at 2 options for cars: 
Option 1: 10k car loan for a 2000-2005 Toyota hilux or Prado that does about 14 litres / 100km
Option 2: 25k-30k car loan for a 2010-2015 Toyota hilux or Prado that does about 8.5 litres/100km
- I have done some analysis and both options work out to have roughly the same monthly cost when you look at loan and fuel consumption - about $800/month
- I also am wondering if it is a good idea to put an extra 10k on the loan to consolidate my credit card debt and cancel the credit card so I have a singular debt to be looking after. 

I am concerned about having such a big loan with Option 2 (around 40k loan) - but it seems silly to be paying the same amount a month for a 20+ year old car. 


Looking for some answers to the following questions:
- What percentage of my income should I be trying to save? Two streams of saving: fun and house deposit
- What percentage of my income should I be trying to budget to for food and expenses?
- is it dumb to get an increased personal loan to consolidate my credit card debt?
- is it dumb to buy a 20+ year old car on a loan?

personalfinance,Unexpected changes leaving me with few options,"Please bear with the long post. Looking for some ideas for a solid plan. 
I‚Äôm  64 yo female. I was married to a financially stable man for 16 years. In 2019 I gladly quit my career job and helped with home improvements and building his 3,000 sf dream shop.  After the shop was built we went through covid, then I got a wonderful new job. We were financially quite comfortable, and I put my paychecks into our household instead of savings.  Fast forward: 8 months ago, out of the blue he asked me for a divorce. He asked me to move out (his name is on the title) so I complied. It was devastating. 

Today I rent a friend‚Äôs RV, which I keep parked on my daughter‚Äôs property in exchange for managing their farm animals, helping with my grandbabies, and house-help. 

My job was remote so I also did that full time from my RV.  However last month my company downsized; I got a pink slip and went through round two of unexpected grief.  I lost my home, my husband, my source of income, health insurance, and what was left of my dignity in 8 months. 

I put together a plan to buy, after divorce settlement, a newer RV to replace the one I rent. In addition to the 35-40,000 cost, I would spend another 10 grand on a porch, skirting, and a steel RV carport to cover all. Another 10 grand to bring down water and 50 amp power.  This would be my permanent home. 
Today I‚Äôm not so sure of my plan. (Is it wise to plan to live in a 40 ft RV til I die? What if I become injured or ill, RV depreciation, etc) 

So this brings me to my numbers and where I am now:
‚ÄîHealth insurance is covered: with divorce and no income I qualified for Medicaid til Medicare kicks in. 
‚ÄîI have no retirement. Only a tiny Roth IRA with 9,000, and 4,000 in the bank from my severance pay.
‚ÄîI can take SS for 1500 a month but it would be 2100 if I waited three more years 
‚ÄîI do get 1,000 per month in support. 
‚Äîmy car is paid for but is ready for some maintenance. 
‚ÄîI have no debt, but my daughter and SIL have paid for me to have an attorney, and I really want to pay that back: 9,000.

I could ask my daughter and SIL if they want to go in with me and build him a shop with apartment built in and enjoy a nice property improvement for half the cost‚Äîbut they really don‚Äôt have the funds to do that right now.

personalfinance,Potential First Time Homebuyer - If I Can Afford To Be?,"
Hello all. I‚Äôm looking to potentially purchase my first home and I‚Äôm starting to question if it‚Äôs a smart move or if I can even afford to.

Here‚Äôs a quick summary:

Income: $75,000
Living expenses minus housing: $2100/mo
Savings: $60,000
Retirement/brokerage: $50,000

I live in an area where the very modest homes I‚Äôd be looking at are going for around 200K.

Income will fluctuate with my new career. There will almost assuredly be years where I‚Äôm making quite a bit more, but I wanted to use a conservative number that lines up with what I‚Äôm bringing in this year. 

I know I could pull money out of a Roth as a first time homebuyer, but ideally I‚Äôd rather not touch any of the retirement/brokerage accounts.

I got excited because I finally had some money saved up, a seemingly solid job, and the will to make a purchase. Then I started doing some research, googling how much house can I afford, and trying to add up all of the expenses of owning a home and I feel like it‚Äôs out of reach.

So now I‚Äôm panicked and doing what‚Äôs sensible - reaching out to Reddit for advice and what my game plan should be.

personalfinance,prudent to finance a car at 0.9% APR w/36mo term?,"I'm deciding between lightly used car, or buying a new car and taking advantage of this dope interest rate.

Right up front - if this ends up being a bad bet, I'll still be able to make the payments, it will just be super annoying, so not so much a ""how much car can you afford"" question, but a ""how to maximize the use of $25-30K over 3 years"" question.

You may say, obviously the used car! but if prices are similar, a slightly more expensive new car, financed, may just be ""cheaper"" over the 3 year term, if I had that cash invested in a safe index fund, eg S&P 500.

can anyone help me do this math? or logic if it's totally obvious?

  
for the sake of example, let's say: 

used car at $25k OTD - still in warranty, less than 3yrs old, CPO

new car $30k OTD - financing at 0.9% for 36 months

$5K down, say (or should I put any down at all if not required?...) 

  
I have the amortization schedule (thank you Nerdwallet) to compare to, but... 

how do I determine what the opportunity cost of the difference is? I feel like this is some precalc that I hated in high school... but stick with me.

  
each month the ""principal balance"" is an amt I could have invested in an index fund rather than have paid cash for the whole car. This changes every month, of course.

Cost of loan ends up being less than $400 when all is said and done.

I feel like it's relatively safe to say an investment today in the s&p 500 will go up more than 0.9% over 3 years - though I know its possible it could be yo yo ing throughout the 3 years. I'll probably usually have $4-8K buffer cash in checking, so wont be forced to sell on one particularly bad day at least.

  
SO - having acknowledged that these numbers are all make believe, how can i determine, in the event of an  average 5% gain over 3 years, the real cost difference between financing and buying outright? Or is there a dope calculator site anyone can recommend? I thought I was brilliant just calculating the full principle, but obviously its a different amount each month. 

This must be something people weigh out all the time, no?

personalfinance,Past Employer Incorrectly Put Severance Pay into 401k,"Recently, I received a letter from the 401k manager of a place I worked several employers ago stating that when they laid me off, they incorrectly deferred some of my severance to my 401k and that the old employer contributed 401k match. They are ""requesting"" me to send the money back, but what I'm more concerned about are the tax implications. They are advising me to contact the place I rolled the 401k into and have the money simply paid out to me directly, but the problem is that *that* was my previous employer and I have no 401k there anymore. I can contact the place where I rolled that money into, but I am worried that this income will probably be messed up in some way (for instance, taxes are probably not deferred from it).

  
The timeline looks something like this:

Early 2023 - I am laid off and **Employer A** incorrectly handles my severance

Mid 2023 - I start a new job at **Employer B**, but soon quit. During my short stay, I rolled my 401k from **Employer A** to my plan at **Employer B**

Late 2023 - I start *another* new job at **Employer C**

Early 2024 - Not wanting to roll over twice in one year, I wait to roll over my 401k from **Employer B** to **Employer C** at beginning of 2024

Early 2024 - I complete my 2023 tax return, it is accepted by IRS etc

Late 2024 - 401k place from **Employer A** contacts me and says that they messed up back in 2023 and advises me to request a check from where I rolled the money into, then send a personal check to my old employer

  
Has anyone ever seen a scenario like this before? The amount which is ineligible is around $5k, and the employer match they're ""asking"" to have returned is around $1k. That's not a financial hardship for me and I don't have a problem paying it back since they *did* technically over-pay. I'm more concerned with what the process here should be or how to do this without messing up my taxes for my 2024 return.

The HDHP costs $136/month with a $3,300 deductible, while the PPO is $196/month with a $600 deductible.

I visit a therapist 1-2 times per month, with each session costing about $210, and I also see a licensed nurse practitioner monthly for controlled prescriptions at similar costs. (24 visits per year minimum)

I just met my HDHP deductible this past week, mainly because I started therapy and prescriptions partway through.

I currently have $3,000 saved in my HSA from the HDHP, which my employer and I contributed to (they contribute $2000).

Given that I'm in good health and have moderate healthcare needs, I feel I‚Äôm between the low and high spending spectrum.

I've always been adamant about having a renter to help pay a mortgage, and to make it more of an investment but most pre existing duplexes are out of my price range ($400k+) and after nearly a year of searching I'm really sick of waiting and want to buy.

For context, I take home just under $4k/month after taxes. Literally next in line to be promoted within 3-4 months which would almost double my income, but of course nothing is guaranteed. Also, I have a low financial risk tolerance, so I'm really not comfortable maxing out my monthly spending.

I easily have 20% down for $300-$350k

So options are:

. Purchase the only existing duplex in my price range (Has been on market for almost a year, bad area) I low balled earlier in the year and they didn't budge. (cheapest option/month)

. Just give up on the duplex/investment idea and just buy a cheaper single family home for myself to live in for now (most expensive/month)

I've got a home repair and renovation in progress that's grown a bit in scope, and I will need a bit of cash to cover the difference. I could use some advice looking at my current options, or any other suggestions ya'll may have. 

Estimated cash shortage: $35-50,000 

Resources:

- Employer stock - $32k (but need to wait for a selling window to touch, which is a few months out)
- Market accounts/Misc stocks - $370k
- Emergency Cash fund: $10k 

Retirement:

- 401k - $94k
- Roth IRA- $49k
- Previous employer IRA - $102k

Loan Options

- 401k loan - up to $47k at 9%, 12-60 month terms.  
- HFS - 9.24% for up to $100k, 30 year term, plus loan origination fees. 
- Home Equity of about 20% on a $670k house, has not been leveraged. 

Income
 
- Monthly Household take home pay $14,500
- Monthly expenses $9,500

Our cash flow is very positive, and I expect we'll be able to pay back any loan we take out pretty comfortably over the course of the next few years without major changes.

personalfinance,I need advice on my current car predicament ,"I currently have a 2017 Subaru Crosstrek with approximately 105,000 miles. I bought this vehicle in 2022 for $24,000 (the used car market was awful and this vehicle appeared to be the best practical purchase for safety and use). I put $10,000 down on the vehicle. I currently owe approximately $10,000, and make a monthly payment of $300. When I checked, the current Kelley Blue Book value of my car is between $10,000-$13,000.

Unfortunately, my car has started to have issues the passed year. I believe it has cost me around $3,000-$4,000 this year alone, and most of the issues have been the past couple months. I have fixed all the issues to date, but am concerned about the longevity of the car. My concern is that by the time I pay the vehicle off it will basically be time for a new vehicle, considering the many problems. I asked my mechanic about the state of my vehicle, and they said with a car this age/mileage, I should expect to spend $1500 on maintenance/wear and tear. 

If I'm already spending $300 a month for the car payment and I should expect to spend another $1500 a year ($125 a month) on this car for the next few years until it is paid off, I feel like I'm basically paying $425 a month for the car. 

I have the ability to pay off the remainder of this car at the end of the year. I am debating if I should pay the car off, sell it at the Kelley Blue Book value (I know I'll get less than those numbers most likely), and lease a car (credit score shouldn't be a problem). Locally, I have friends who have leased brand new EVs in the area for under $250 a month.

I bought a house a 20 years old, I started building a second house on the property. About 7 months ago, my loan got sold to Freedom Mortgage, my loan had been sold several times before and I thought direct deposit information always transferred over. This time I didn't check, and with all the money I was spending on construction, I didn't notice that the money wasn't being withdrawn. I feel so stupid for not noticing but alas its done.

  
Over those 7 months my credit score fluctuated slightly, but only by a point or two. I know its not a totally accurate process so I thought this was normal. Then, in October it dropped 200 points. I immediately went and checked and found my loan was in ""active foreclosure"". I immediately called and got a reinstatement started, but it took around 3 weeks from beginning to end. Luckily I had almost exactly that much money saved up. November 12th my loan was fully reinstated, but my credit score is only around 552 now.

I have some friends that deal with mortgages, and they said I should call Freedom Mortgage and beg for forgiveness essentially. Ive made a few calls to their service department with varying levels of sympathy from the agent. Twice now theyve sent me to the escalation line, but then I end up on hold for 30 minutes straight and eventually the call gets dropped. I understand they might not be able to expunge the foreclosure, but even a letter from them explaining the situation could help

  
My goal was to buy a few more properties in my twenties and build some more houses, but with such an awful credit score it seems like I might have to let go of this hope.



I feel so stupid, I have never missed a payment before this, I had all the money in my bank account, and resolved the issue straight away when I found out about it, but it seems like Freedom isnt going to/able to help me get this resolved. Is my only hope to try and call the credit bureaus? Thats my next step but I feel like they will have even less understanding than Freedom.

personalfinance,IRA to HSA Transfer - Advice Needed,"Here's the situation...

* Actively enrolled in CDHP and maxing out HSA contribution for 2024(family coverage). Planned to continue this in 2025.
* Actively enrolled in Charles Schwab 401k, contributing 6% to meet employer match.
* Sitting on a $9k traditional IRA with Betterment. I have not been contributing for more than a year because I don't qualify for tax deduction due to income limit. For context, this was funded by an old employer 401k.

With one Qualified HSA Funding Distribution allowed per lifetime, I am considering the following for **2025**...

* Transfer $8,550 (2025 HSA contribution limit) from the IRA to the HSA in January. This would meet my limit for the year, but in turn not allow me to contribute pre-tax dollars from my income for the rest of the year. At the same time, it would be a tax-free funding. 
* Increase my 401k contribution to make up the difference (if not more) of what I would have been contributing to my HSA to keep my taxable income lower.
* Rollover the remaining IRA balance to Charles Schwab 401k (if possible, I need to confirm).

personalfinance,Wondering which direction with property should be taken.,"Three and a half years ago, my wife and I bought a parcel of land in middle Vermont with a cash payment (overtime from COVID in both our jobs) that was originally valued at 100k from the seller but was knocked down to 70k due to her desperation from an imminent cross country move. 

This parcel is a very foliage-heavy secluded 5 acres with a well for water and power lines that extend all the way to the property. It lies near a ski mountain and an affluent town (about 7 miles away), and has already appreciated to about ~$150,000 based on listings for similar or smaller lots in the area. 

Obviously we appreciate the property value having gone up, and we know that property especially in a nice mountainous area should be seen as an investment, but we also are relatively financially illiterate. Would it make the most sense to continue holding onto this property or sell it for a healthy chunk of money down the line and have it grow elsewhere? 

We obviously have a vague image of ourselves retiring and building a cozy A-Frame cabin decades from now (both in our late 20s), but with an amount of money that is exponentially higher, we would be able to retire more comfortably.

personalfinance,Tax and investment advice to deal with 401k required minimum distribution,"Good afternoon everyone!  My mother-in-law asked me for some advice on her situation and I'd like to get some feedback if possible.  She's trying to maximize her funds, minimize her tax burden.

A little bit about her:

* Turned 72 this year and therefore next year she'll be required to take the minimum distribution.  She's not touched it yet, doesn't need the cash at present and is doing fine on her Social Security.
* RMD will be about $20k (and will almost double her current annual income).
* SS is about $24k a year.
* 401k is mostly in stocks according to her (she's not very savvy, I will be reviewing myself to better understand positions).
* Does not currently have a Roth or taxable brokerage account.
* Lives in CT.
* House is paid off but does have an property tax bill for it of $8k/yr.  CT gives a credit of $200 for her tax bracket towards home taxes paid.
* Not married or planning to get married, lives with long-term partner.



My thoughts:

* Start moving 401k funds into less risky investments due to her age.
* Open Roth and taxable brokerage accounts for her.
* Use RMD to max Roth, put rest in taxable brokerage.  Similar investments as the 401k, lower risk stuff due to age.

Do you think my plan is good?  Is there anything else you would do or something different?  In the short term to limit risk but maximize her return should I be looking for other vehicles like CDs while the returns aren't too bad on them (I know with the Fed rate changes this isn't going to last)?",1731608444.0

personalfinance,Auto Purchase Advice,"I purchased a 2015 BMW 328i xdrive as a certified pre-owned with 35,000 miles on it back in the summer of 2018 for just under $28,000. In 2018 I was making $70,000 annual, had student loans, and with the auto loan had around a total of $50,000 worth of debt. Yes, I know, I paid a lot of stupid tax and know it was not the greatest financial decision now. I was 28 years old then.

In 2019, I got serious about improving my financial situation. I paid off the car back in 2020 and have enjoyed no car payments and low insurance premiums ($730 annually now) since then. What I have not enjoyed is how expensive the car maintenance and repairs have been. Since the maintenance plan ended in the same year of 2020, I have spent just under $10,000 in car repairs / maintenance (tires, brakes, shocks, sensors failing, you name it, pretty much everything besides transmission or engine related). I have paid cash for all the repairs.

The BMW still runs great and is in very good condition with 107,000 miles on it now. I love the car, but have been reflecting on the purchase of it and wishing I bought a more practical car at the time. I bought a house in 2021 with my fianc√©e (we agreed to a cohabitation agreement) and the BMW hasn't been very useful around the household (needing to transport large boxes / items / bags, paying premium gas for long road trips to see family, we don't have kids but we have a dog that I don't let him travel with me in the BMW sadly.

I have been considering a compact SUV would be a better vehicle for me and family. My base salary now is $126,500. I paid off the students loans at the beginning of this year. My only debt is the mortgage. Total home expenses at $1900 a month (mortgage, escrow, internet, water, waste), other monthly expenses is $235 (auto insurance, cell phone, subscriptions), I save $2500 a month (15% retirement, 10% employee stock purchase). My monthly disposable income is $2200. Net worth \~$340,000 with around $30,000 liquid cash (savings / checking).

I have been looking at purchasing a new 2025 Hyundai Tucson Hybrid Limited. MSRP $41,195. I've done my research and the vehicle fits what I'm looking for - good 35 MPG, good engine, regular gas, normal 6-speed transmission, good repair cost / maintenance, leading cargo capacity and technology features. The Tucson is actually in stock at dealerships compared to RAV-4 or CRV and has more features in general. It would also come with a 3-year maintenance plan and 10-year / 100k mile powertrain warranty at no extra cost. Hyundai is also offering 48-month financing at 0% APR until the end of the year, so I wouldn't be paying interest on top of a depreciating asset.

From what I've read the Tucson would fit most of the generally accepted car affordability pieces of advice I've seen for me. No more than 35% of gross income. I would look at private selling or trading in the BMW for $6-9k and put it towards the 20% down payment. Looks like the monthly car payment will be around $780 a month (10% or my income) which I would pay extra money to pay off sooner when I can (as I did with the BMW).

Would this be a good, logical financial purchase? Or should I keep the BMW? Any advice would be appreciated.

(I am not really leaning towards buying used because all of the compact SUVs I'm interested in within the last 5 years (Tucson, RAV-4, and CRV) are still mostly above $20,000-40,000 depending on the milage, but could still be convinced)",1731607482.0

personalfinance,Should I liquidate holdings before transferring IRA & brokerage away from NWM?,"**TL;DR** \- Wanting to transfer a Roth IRA, a joint brokerage account, along with spouse's IRA and Roth IRA away from Northwestern Mutual to Vanguard. I'm planning to ditch every NWM holding for Vanguard's target date funds and hopefully forgetting it for several years. 

* Do I need to instruct NWM to liquidate before initiating the transfer? Are there any consequences to that? 
* Also, a bonus question about term life and long-term disability insurance.

Hi r/personalfinance. Longtime lurker, first time poster. 

I've realized the error of my ways in choosing to invest any money with Northwestern Mutual. The fees are approximately 1.7%, which I've now realized is insane. I‚Äôm looking for some advice/thoughts on this plan of action and my questions below.

I opened a new Roth IRA and joint brokerage account with Vanguard. In speaking with Vanguard about the current holdings with NWM, they explained that some of the holdings were not transferable and would have to be liquidated before the transfer. I then explained that I intend to liquidate everything and invest in a target date fund. The agent then said that I could then instruct NWM to liquidate everything first and then transfer.

I should also note: I have made no additional contributions to either accounts since their inception. I‚Äôm outside the bracket for IRA contributions now.

**My first question:** Is it accurate to say that I should instruct my NWM representative to liquidate the holdings to prepare for transfer? Is there a better way to do it?

**My second question:** What are the consequences of liquidation versus transferring the transferable holdings, for both the brokerage and Roth IRA?

* It will likely shock no one that the performance is shit. My Roth IRA has a dollar-weighted rate of return of 4.53% over roughly 3.5 years. (I don‚Äôt have my wife‚Äôs performance in front of me at the moment, but I believe it to be similar.) It‚Äôs also not a lot of money: Mine has a current value $45,000, gain of approximately $6,000. (My wife‚Äôs Traditional and Roth IRA account balances are higher, approximately $125,000 total.)
* The joint brokerage account is even worse: Just 0.67% dollar-weighted rate of return. (It was set up as a sort of rainy day fund to just beat inflation, but it clearly hasn‚Äôt even done that.) $25,000 starting balance, $600 of gains in 3.5 years.

**My third question:** My wife and I also have 30-year term life insurance and long-term disability (LTD) insurance through NWM. Should we keep these policies? Anything to look for?

* We opened both policies several years ago. While we haven‚Äôt had any major health issues since, I‚Äôm thinking that underwriting new policies would probably be more expensive.
* We are 36M and 35F with two young kids, one more on the way. The term life and LTD make sense, from what I‚Äôve read. If one or both of us passed, the financial burden would be big and that‚Äôs the purpose. When the policies expire in like \~23 years, the kids will be older and we‚Äôll hopefully have more financial independence by then.

I will say, to their credit, my NWM representative never tried to sell me whole life insurance. In fact, once I asked about it (as an idiot) once, and he told me no, it‚Äôs not for you. He said to ignore the mailings and emails from NWM corporate, that‚Äôs not a good idea for you. This is probably what lulled me into a false sense of security with the investments.

Appreciate everyone‚Äôs thoughts. Cheers.",1731605855.0

I was looking for advice for my situation. My credit score is in the low 600s and I have about 55k in debt that is taking a significant toll on my monthly income. The total amount I pay monthly is about $1800.

personalfinance,Should I stay in my very cheap (but problematic) apartment while paying off student loans?,"My gross annual salary is $130,000, before any bonus. Works out to about $7,500/month take home. I live in a very cheap apartment, about $600/month, which is about 8% of my take home pay. I live here because the low rent allows me to put more money each month toward paying off my law school loans.


But the apartment has issues. There are critters living in the wall and ceiling. The landlord has put down some poison pellets for rats, but whatever is hanging out in my wall/ceiling is still there, and it sounds bigger than a rat or mouse. Storm damage this year has caused trees to fall and take out power lines, and has caused a lot of damage to the roof and side of the building. As a result, the ceiling leaks whenever it rains. Until now I've always just put down a bucket and dealt with it. But it's gotten progressively worse, and this morning, part of the ceiling fell in and landed on me while I was still in bed. It was about a half-inch thick portion of plaster (like the popcorn ceiling you see in older buildings), probably about an 8 foot by 8 foot section, so it's not like the roof literally caved in on my head or anything, but still. I don't like my ceiling falling on my while I'm sleeping.


I tend to be very frugal and conservative with money, especially now, when I have student loans to pay down. I could move to a much newer, bigger, nicer apartment, and still not spend more than 25% of my monthly income on rent. But I tend to be a bit stingy, and I like the safety net that comes with living so far below my means. I'm wondering if I've crossed the line from very frugal to downright unhealthy. 


What do you all think? Would you continue living in the very cheap apartment and paying off the student loans as aggressively as possible, or would you move to a nicer place?

personalfinance,Putting Savings in Money Market/Mutual Fund inside Roth IRA to grow tax free and pulling out initial contributions when needed. Acceptable or bad idea?,"So I'm thinking of moving a chunk of my savings into a Roth IRA to grow better in a tax-free account. It's my understanding that you can pull out contributions themselves penalty-free (any gains are subject to penalty, but the initial contribution amounts can be withdrawn is how I've read the rules). I understand that the annual contribution limits are quite low, so the maximum tax implications for the interest in a savings account are not a major concern, but I have several thousand left for the year I could move over. I see it as not much effort to save a bit on taxed interest.
