dogs,Breed Suggestions,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
  
1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* No. We had three dogs growing up and I had a dog of my own when I first moved out. I've worked with dogs my entire life and specialize in dog behavior / training.  
  
2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* Either is fine but I'm most likely going to get a rescue.  
  
3)Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* A medium or large dog that has a mix of energy levels. I'd like to be able to go on walks with them but also chill around the house too.  
  
4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* I've always loved great pyrs. I feel like they would be a good fit for me.   
  
5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* Basic obedience stuff and maybe a few fun tricks.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* No.  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* I'm disabled and don't work so I have all the time I need. Realistically, it would be a few hours a day.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* We have a walking trail right next to our house that I plan on using for walks. Minimum walk is 30 minutes but can be a few hours.  
  
9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* I'm having to do a lot of brushing for my cat already so I wouldn't mind doing a daily brushing for the dog too. I do all of my own grooming and have done it for all of the dogs I've had in the past.  
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)What size dog are you looking for?  
  
\* Medium to large. I guess technically they might be considered extra large but nothing like a great dane or irish wolfhound.   
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* Ideally, shedding shouldn't be a problem, it doesn't really bother me. I don't mind a dog that barks, especially if people come to the door and such. I'm not a huge slobber fan but it's worth it for some dog love.  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* I don't really ever plan on having them off leash unless we go to my in-laws. They have a huge property out in the country. So... not really?  
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* Both but probably a more snuggly dog.  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  
  
\* Both to this too. They don't have to be over the top eager to please but I would like the dog to listen.  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
\* I do prefer if dogs bark at strangers if they're at the door or in our yard but I would want them to be a bit comfortable with strangers.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
\* I have before and I'm willing to again.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
\* The only other person is my husband and he doesn't have many preferences. He'll be helping with petting the dog and that's about it. He may help with taking care of the dog if I need help doing it but it'll mainly be my thing.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
\* I have a normal house cat.  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
\* No but we do live by an elementary school so I'd like for them to be okay with children.  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
\* No, we own our house.  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
\* Saskatchewan, Canada. There's a few breed bans in my area but not in my city.  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
\* 85F (29C) for summer and 10F (-12C). There's some days where it's much hotter and some days where it's much colder but those days don't usually last long.

dogs,Best donut dog bed from Amazon?,"Is there a donut dog bed from Amazon worth getting with a washable cover?

I see some that you can throw the whole thing in the washer too, so many choices but they all have some bad reviews.

Most reviews say the middle part flattens instantly and not worth getting, I know I can add more foam to it but do any last?

Also trying to decide on shag vs lux, some say longer shag fibers/strands matt down compared to shorter lux that is easier to care for.

Thanks for any help in advance.

dogs,"What dog would be good for an active lifestyle, but living in a smaller apartment? ","\*\*Introduction\*\*

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
ANSWER: This will be the first dog that *I* own, I have wanted a dog ever since I learned what dogs were. But due to different situations I have never been able to have my own. However, I grew up with a dog who lived with my grandparents. She was a big dog with a lot of energy in her early years, but we became very good friends regardless.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]**  
ANSWER: Right now I would prefer a breeder, however I am very open to rescue in later years!

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**  
ANSWER: I am looking for a dog who wants to go on adventures with me and come with me to the stables! Who is kind to other animals/dogs/horses/kids. I would like a dog who likes to learn stuff and just explore the world and be friends with me!

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
ANSWER:   
My favorite breed has always been **golden retrievers**, and I guess it has always been the idea, as well when I imagine the future it's often a Golden I see..   
They are very kind and work well with both kids and other animals. They are also, *from my understanding*, quite adaptable and just “happy to be here”. However, it is a big dog and I am questioning if it would be cruel to keep a Golden in an *apartment*, despite my active lifestyle..

I have also looked into **Australian Shepherds**, because I really like them but I don't think I'll be able to give one a fair life the way me and Aussie dog wants.  
  
I have looked into smaller dogs such as **Daschhounds** and **Cavapoos** (which is the dog my parents are gonna get next month.. do not ask about the timing of them getting a dog right after I move, when I have asked for a dog for 18 years xD) but I don’t think that of a small dog would be comfortable with the work and adventures I want to do.. However I'm open if you want to change my mind!  
  
**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
ANSWER: I really want to teach it fun and creative tricks and give it meaningful tasks. I am still learning a lot about trick-training.. I also have a friend who does “nose work” where her dogs learn to search and find stuff, which seems cool! I have also wanted to do agility ever since I was a kid, and I live pretty close to a “park” where you can do stuff like that!   
  
**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
ANSWER: Like I said before, I don’t have *that* much experience with dogs, but I learn very fast and I am very interested in dog training as well! I have a few people who I think can help me on the way too! I really want to do some trick training, not only “sit”, “paw” or “roll” but more fun, creative and difficult things!   
If it likes agility it's more of a bonus.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
ANSWER: I will try to be with my dog as much as possible, both train it and play with it multiple times/day. Of course it might vary if I like have the flu or something, but I have a lot of people around me who can help me so the dog will never be alone or forgotten. But like I said before, I am looking to bring it with me on adventures and also to work, since I want to work on some kind of farm where dog can roam free a bit.

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**    
ANSWER: I would like to think I am quite the active person. And when I don’t exactly enjoy running, it might be something that a dog will teach me to enjoy xD   
However I do love long walks through the neighborhoods, in the countryside and in the forest. I live in the “farmlands” of Sweden so we have a ton of forests and fields to play fetch! There is also (i think) a dog park pretty close to us, and like I said my parents are getting a dog, so once I get a dog it will be able to naturally socialize with both people and dogs.

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
ANSWER: I am used to groom- and care for horses, which isn’t exactly the same but I have still learned about animal care, brushing and stuff like that. And whilst I’m not exactly a professional I am pretty sure I will learn, and the things I don’t know how to do I will ask to someone who knows! 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

**10) What size dog are you looking for?**  
ANSWER: The ideal would be a medium size/bigger dog. Like a *Golden* or a Lab*,* but like I said before; I have the dilemma of living in a smaller apartment but still having an active lifestyle. I really do not want a dog who will be sad because it feels trapped or like it can’t zoom around in the inside.

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
ANSWER: Shedding is fine, I can vacuum and brush it outside. Slobber can be cleaned up as well. Barking however might make Mr. Landlord quite unhappy.. I mean, it’s a dog and it’s not like I can just make it not bark, but I would prefer a dog who doesn’t bark at every leaf that hits the window..

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
ANSWER: It is very important to me since I want to have it loose when I do farm work or hike in the forest. Therefore I can’t have a ""reactive"" dog or a dog with too strong hunting instincts.. Even though the first thing I will teach it will be “recall” or “leave it”, I still don’t want it to go run off after some poor hamster or bark at some toddler. Especially in the woods since Sweden has quite some wild life, like moose and the super pigs (the  evil ones with teeth). 

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
ANSWER: I love to cuddle and I don't mind having a dog who wants to be close.

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**  
ANSWER: I would love a dog who likes to work and learn new stuff. But I want it to *want* to do stuff and follow me around on adventures. 

**15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**    
ANSWER: I do not want it to be super reactive.. I would rather it asks a robber for belly rubs instead of barking and risking making someone angry. I will do the protecting in case of a robbery, and I would rather fist fight a bear than having my hypothetical dog get hurt.. xD 

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
ANSWER: No.

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**  
ANSWER: Like I think I said before, I don’t want it to have any super hunter instincts.. 

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
ANSWER: Not for long, maybe an hour or two at a time max. However, I will train it to be alone in case of emergencies as well as to prevent separation anxiety. If I have to be gone for long I will find a dog sitter because I do not want it to be stuck inside regardless of what dog it is

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**   
ANSWER: I will live alone but close to my parents and siblings. I think they’re willing to dog-sit unless the dog is mean to their dog or the kid. And we will definitely arrange play-dates too! 

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**  
ANSWER: I don’t want another inside pet, however it needs to be friendly with farm animals, especially horses and cats. But also other dogs.

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
ANSWER: Yes.

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
ANSWER: I will rent (i think is the word) an apartment, and as far as I know there aren’t any legal restrictions on the apartment, however I might get a few weird looks if I get one of those huge fluffy ones 

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
ANSWER: I live in Sweden, and as far as I know there isn’t any forbidden dogs. 

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
ANSWER: I live in Sweden so the winters are cold cold like -20 Celsius, but the summers can be quite warm as well some days.

dogs,Looking for new and creative enrichment ideas,"I am constantly trying to find new enrichment that my dog can do. He’s very happy working for his toys and food with our current activities, but I want to expand what we do. When I turn to the internet to find new ideas, most of it is the same: puzzle toys, lick mats, kongs. Those are great for some dogs but he doesn’t get a whole lot out of it. I am usually very creative with this but I am stuck atm and want to see if anyone has something we could try out. **I wanna focus on engagement, building up and reducing arousal level, strengthening our bond, and independent problem solving.** 

some information about him: He is a senior german shepherd mix. he’s still very active but because of his age, I obviously want to avoid anything high impact. he reacts to bikes and joggers (but has improved so much since we got him), and I don’t know if that’s relevant but I figured I’d add that. He is highly intelligent and gets bored easily, so I am looking for something with a bit of a higher level of difficulty. when we are inside, he seems uncomfortable doing these activities, when either him or I, are standing or moving around. We don't know anything about his life before we got him, but we think he was confined to a small kennel, and overall wasn’t treated well. so he does most enrichment activities on the floor, except for tearing apart boxes and newspaper, scent work, and when I throw a treat across the room and recall him. 

What we already do that works:

* scent work and scatter feeding
* fetching, herding, and racing to basketballs
* loose leash walking and skill practice on a long lead
* walks specifically for sniffing and exploring-around our neighborhood and wooded areas, and walks more focused on obedience 
* tearing apart boxes and newspaper
* free shaping: resting his head on the ground, stepping up on a platform (I really want to do more free shaping exercises)
* obstacle courses
* relaxing outside of our property and observing surroundings (still working on)

What hasn’t worked, not interested in:

* retrieving objects
* playing with toys, other than basketballs, outside
* flirt poles
* he breaks most puzzle toys 
* rolling food up in a towel
* anything that involves him getting wet, unless it’s with the hose

I know this is very limiting but I figured I’d see if anyone has any ideas.

dogs,What dog would suit me?,"Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. Experience with a Shar Pei. Raised it to be non aggressive, basic commands. Now how to act around dogs and be assertive but kind too. I'm willing to push myself further this time as I was younger when I first got my Shar Pei and attend training classes.

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

Breeder ideally, open to shelters.

Describe your ideal dog.

A dog with a unique distinct personality. A dog being naturally aloof, quieter, etc is not something I see as a personality flaw but a welcome part of the breed as long as it does not venture into any unwanted behaviours. 

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Shar Peis are the love of my life, but given the health conditions and other problems, I'm unsure if I'll get another. 

Breeds I'm considering.

- English Bull Terrier

- Rottweiler

- Chow Chow

- Boxer

- Akita

- Mastiffs

Not interested in Labradors, Golden Retrievers.

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

The basics, sit, come, follow, stop, drop it, no food aggression, paw. Not too into tricks if the dog wouldn't want too, but basic commands definitely.

Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No.

Care Commitments

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

As much as they want really. I am used to having an aloof Shar Pei who preferred their own space and solitude. But I'm happy to spend a lot of time interacting and playing with my dog.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Multiple hours on my days off, which vary. Four days some weeks. Two on others. An hour or so when I'm working. Will try make up for it more on the off days by going to more far places. It'll all vary really, some days will be a quick walk around the area a few times through the day to make up his exercise, others will be long days out. In maybe two years should have a bit of garden space too and  there'll always be someone to let them in and out. Less if it's what the dog wants or needs, i.e avoiding over exertion in Mastiffs.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I'll do whatever it takes for the right breed.

Personal Preferences

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium ideal. Or lower large end. Whilst Mastiffs are huge, it's more the exercise commitments I'm thinking about rather than overall size.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Unbothered.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Don't want to do this.

Dog Personality and Behavior

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Can handle either. do want a dog that wants to play.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Somewhere inbetween.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Aloof but friendly to strangers is fine.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

If necessary.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Not really.

Lifestyle

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

It'll vary. One of us works mondays 9-5 and the other works shifts. There'll be days where it can be around 6-7 hours, but others where it's only 2. And a lot of the time, someone will be off work in the week days so there'll be 4 days a week, maybe 3 on average where they are not home alone.                                   

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Two people looking after and very involved, two a bit distant but okay with dogs. Other two aren't mentioned in the care commitments but will often be in the house.


20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Unaffected.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

UK.

dogs,Training dog not to jump on me when I'm seated?,"Hey! So I'm relatively new at this. I've got my dog, Aragorn (~1.5yrs, some kind of hound) pretty well trained not to jump if I'm standing, but if I'm sitting in a chair, he sometimes tries to get my attention by jumping on me. Which in this case means getting on his hind legs and putting his front legs on my shoulders/throat/face.

I am not fond of having paws on my throat, which I think is understandable. I generally respond by moving his paws off of me and then going to another room so he does not have access to me, my attention, or my neck. 

I would prefer that he simply does not try to do this. Any thoughts on how to train that?

dogs,Sit Means Sit - Engages in Deceptive Marketing Practices To Hide Negitivity,"Figured I'd make this one known.

Compulsive training company Sit Means Sit who uses deception to try to sell the shock collar training method, whose method uses negative reinforcement at an escalating level while pretending it's an ""attention getter"" has been giving the mod team problems on dog subs.

They're trying to get us to remove all posts critical of them while pretending to be lawyers claiming that critics are nothing more than ""competing trainers"" rather than providing legitimate reviews of their services. They *claim* that it's in violation of the FTC's stance on fake reviews, and are trying to use this to get us to remove those critical posts. There is no evidence of this, despite their claim that these anonymous people who don't even have their locations mentioned are simply competitors. We're leaving these posts up, and I'm posting this to make it known how they operate.

They've been engaging in abuse of the report button to try to shut it down, using the option that it's pornography, etc.

Interestingly enough, as somebody who has previously worked in marketing, the new FTC guidelines actually prohibit companies from removing critical reviews, creating fake reviews of themselves, and cherry picking reviews for their website to display. This is exactly what they're doing.

Anyways, this marks another reason not to service this company. Do not trust them. They're taking immense steps to shut down any critics, and due to the unregulated nature of the industry this makes them incredibly dangerous.

dogs,[breed] recommendation for a lifelong cat lady ,"I have been a cat lady my whole life. When I met my husband, we each had cats, but combining that number of cats really aggravated a mild all ergy into something bad. He put up with it for years but since our last cat passed about a year ago, his breathing has been better. He grew up with dogs, so he said he’d be interested in getting a dog. He had a German shorthaired pointer but he lived in the country and had space. We are in the suburbs. I don’t really know anything about dogs so I’m hoping to get some suggestions. 

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* My first but my spouse had a dog growing up 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I don’t really know. I’d like a dog that likes to snuggle and doesn’t bark. I’d like a dog that doesn’t need a ton of running with a person. A dog that’s good with kids so our kid can participate in caring for it. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My friend had a chocolate lab and that was the best dog ever. But I don’t really know anything about dog breeds. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic dog commands. But my husband really wants to train the dog to go skiing with us. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I really don’t know. I can bring a dog to work with me when I go into the office and that is 3 days per week, so I’m hoping to get more interaction with the dog that way. My husband also works from home so the dog will not be alone much. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 2-3 20-30 minute walks at least. We also have a park in the neighborhood where the dog can be off leash and there are dog parks not too far, though those might be a weekend activity. Like I’ve said a lot, I really don’t know much about dogs so if I need to adjust my expectations, I can do that. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I grew up with a long haired cat that required a lot of grooming, so that wouldn’t be my preference. But basic cleaning and grooming is ok. We would use a groomer for more detailed grooming. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* I’d prefer a medium sized dog. I really do not want a small dog

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Not a lot, especially the barking. I’d prefer shedding to barking. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This is not an issue for us

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* snuggly 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* no preference 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* No barking. I’d prefer if the dog was friendly to strangers rather than aggressive 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Barking is my big concern 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* At least one adult works from home M-F so the dog might only be alone for an hour or so during the week. On weekends, we’d plan to bring the dog skiing and leave it in the van for approximately 2 hour stretches. This seems very common where we ski. Summers we are mostly home or would board the dog when traveling. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My husband really wants a dog that is less likely to cause all ergies. We also have a 5yo who is a little scared of big dogs. Our neighbor had a GSP and that dog would knock him over when we visit their house.  Our other neighbors have a doodle mix that’s smaller and our kid likes that dog

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, our 5yo and similarly aged neighborhood kids

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Vermont, not aware of any restrictions. But I don’t want an aggressive breed

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* 75 F in the summer and well below freezing and snowy in the winter 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I don’t know what I don’t know about dogs so please feel free to share good advice.

dogs,Cheap stocking stuffers?,"Hi, so for Christmas I'm wanting to get my dog a stocking with some stuff in it. I'm a new dog owner so I'm still learning a lot and I've only had him for almost 2 months so I'm still learning a lot about him specifically.  


So far he likes the kinds of toys that you can put treats in that are that hard rubber material, not so much a fan of soft toys although rarely he will play around with a few of the stuffed toys I have for him. 



He loves treats and bones, of course. I'm just trying to come up with ideas of some things to put in his stocking that aren't going to be too expensive, but are also kind of more special, like a dog cookie for example. Like I really want the stocking staffers to make him excited, which is hard to do because he is very laid back and doesn't react much to most things. 


Anyone have any ideas? If possible I'd like to spend around 20 on it. Oh and he's a large dog if that makes a difference at all.",1732199817.0

dogs,Is this a problem trainers can help with? Possibly reactive when dogs threaten him,"Hey everyone, I could use some advice. Lately my dog’s reaction to aggressive dogs has been getting worse and worse. In the past year, we’ve had maybe 5-6 aggressive dogs charge at him on our walks, and I haven’t been the best at getting in between them in time, so I know that makes it worse for him. But his reaction after these times were normal. He would freeze, or sometimes angrily bark at them. Those dogs haven’t physically hurt him thankfully. Last weekend though, we were at the dog park (we are officially done with those places though), and two dogs cornered mine by one getting on each side of him, and they both were growling. And then right as I tried to intervene, by dog did a mean correcting bark to get them to back off, and then they all were barking and snarling at each other. They were all over each other, so I grabbed my dog’s harness to pull him away, and then he bit down on a dog, and it took probably like 30 seconds to get him to release the other dog. 😞

Afterwards, I read that grabbing your dog is not recommended because it can freak them out, thinking it’s a dog getting them, so maybe the bite was my fault. And ultimately I know that the other dogs started it with their growling and cornering him. But I don’t want my dog biting another dog anytime the other dog shows small signs of aggression. 

Can a trainer help with this? I’ve also heard from people that me being better at stepping in and protecting my dog is needed so that he trusts that I will take care of him, and he doesn’t have to. Is doing this enough? What else should I be doing? I would love to help him on my own because I don’t really have tons of money to try and see if a trainer can help. I’m also not sure how a trainer can help without putting him in those situations (which surely is a bad idea) because he’s so friendly and loves other dogs. But I obviously really want to avoid my dog hurting another dog, and him potentially becoming reactive. 😞

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!!",1732153754.0
dogs,Lazy dog companion?,"Hey everyone,
I have an extremely chill chihuahua/terrier mix (4.5lbs) who spends most of her time napping, sniffing things, and pretty much has no interest in toys or playing. With the exception of post-bath zoomies. Based on that, I know she has the ability to be playful just maybe not directly with me. She’s not really into puppies and doesn’t want anything to do with my brother’s 30lb border collie/basenji who only ever wants to play. I’m wondering if any of you have similar dogs and if they’ve been more playful around other small, low-energy dogs? I’m curious if having a laid-back companion might bring out a more playful side in her. Would love to hear your experiences!",1732139500.0

dogs,Looking for a dog breed - are my expectations too high?,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

**ANSWER:** I've never had a dog just by myself. I grew up with multiple dogs; however, I haven't trained any of them. I only shared some of the duties rather than fully handling them by myself (I've been around dogs my whole life, though I'm not sure how that counts). I do have theoretical knowledge, though, and I've always felt I understood dogs quite well.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

**ANSWER:** Yes, I'm not sure if I would be able to fully address a dog's negative experiences, especially if the dog is anxious. I prefer going through a reputable breeder.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

**ANSWER:** A small/medium-sized dog (I consider German Shepherd as a large dog, and I'd need to be lucky with its genes for it to fit into a medium basket) that is intelligent and offers some, but isn't aggressive by default. I don't want my dog to kill me in case I make mistakes in the early training :)). I do want the dog to be emotional though. I'm considering a Chow Chow, but they seem rather aloof. We've had some experience with a Maltese Shih Tzu, and we were charmed by how human-like her behaviour was whenever she saw someone crying or struggling. She provided a lot of support.

Both my partner and I will take care of the dog. I'm less active physically; however, I'd prefer a dog that doesn't require more than 1.5 hours of daily basic exercise. We're likely going to provide that minimum, but I know that on certain days, we might not be able to.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

**ANSWER:** A Maltipoo or Maltese is our default choice. It meets all our preferences. However we'd preffer to have wider choice pool.

We are also considering:

* Chow Chow - ideal size if female, seems as lazy as me, though I have concerns about potential aggression and lack of warning before biting
* Miniature Shar Pei (same concerns as above)
* Shiba Inu - great balance, stubborn but might be a bit too large, I think?
* Mudi - apparently incredibly intelligent, which is both a pro and a con. I am, however, concerned about the exercise level it requires to be handled properly

Dogs I'm dreaming of but am unlikely to manage: Doberman or German Shepherd

Dogs I wouldn't like to have: any terrier

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

**ANSWER:** Loose lead walking, basic fetch and similar activities, lie down, come, sit, toilet training, stop, quiet, find, stay, and crate training. I'd like to take my dog to puppy school to socialise it from an early age. There are lots of dogs around our park and neighbourhood.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

**ANSWER:** Not at all

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

**ANSWER:** At least 45 minutes of training every day, at least an hour a day of walking (split into a few outings)

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

**ANSWER:** Mostly walking (outdoors), training primarily indoors but outdoors as well. Playing and training seem the most suitable types of exercise.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

**ANSWER:** At least once a week. I'd be willing to pay a professional to do it though, and I intend to start from the earliest possible age so the dog will be easier to handle in the future.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

**ANSWER:** Small-medium. I’d probably struggle to handle dog heavier than 16-18kg.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

**ANSWER:**

* I do not care much about shedding so it is not a problem at all
* Barking may be a problem, we live in quite big apartment, echo may be a thing.
* Slobbering/drool may be problematic, I never dealt with dog that is drooling/slobbing

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

**ANSWER:** Not really important, but in case there is some “leash incident”, I do not want it to start exploring by running away like there is no tomorrow.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

**ANSWER:** A mix of both, to be fair. I like dogs that are needy and I don't mind being their pillow, but I'd understand if the dog prefers to have some time alone.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

**ANSWER:** Hard to say, but it would be great if the dog didn't treat me and my partner just like automatic feeding machines :D

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

**ANSWER:** I've never met a dog that wouldn't bark when someone is knocking at the door, so I'm quite okay with that. I'd prefer my dog to be friendly with people I greet but naturally suspicious of strangers.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

**ANSWER:** I will try to minimise unreasonable aggression from the puppy's earliest age. Definitely more training would be required if I decided to choose something bigger than a Maltese.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

**ANSWER:** I'd lean more towards a female dog. I want to make sure the dog gives a warning before biting. I don't want barking every single time the dog hears another dog in the stairwell. I'm not really a strong person, therefore random acts of aggression and uncontrollable pulling on the lead wouldn't work if the dog is very strong.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

**ANSWER:** Hardly at all, as we both work remotely and it's extremely likely we'll both remain this way for the next 15 years.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

**ANSWER:** As I mentioned, we are a couple. We both share the same preferences. My partner is more active than I am, though.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

**ANSWER:** Not until I have the opportunity to live in my own house (not likely in the next three years).

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

**ANSWER:** Not at all.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

**ANSWER**: I do rent a flat/apartment currently. Small/medium dog, no definition provided.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

**ANSWER:** Poland, no breed restrictions to be fair. I am not interested in large aggressive dogs.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

**ANSWER:** From -20 celsius (-4f) during the winter to 35 celcius (95f) in the summer.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

**ANSWER:** Moving with the dog will not be a problem in future. There are a lot of dogs in the area (95% leashed).

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

**ANSWER:** How does my experience with dogs translate into 'sole ownership' of a dog? I've spent my whole life with dogs, mostly mixed breeds, but I was only handling part of the responsibilities. The dogs I've dealt with had mostly just basic training and were mainly medium/small-sized, so that's kind of my comfort zone. I can somewhat read/understand them, but I'm not sure how significant that is. I struggle to estimate my level of practical experience.",1732133243.0
dogs,behavior training tips plz plz,"

Hello, everyone! 

Seeking some stories of experience or advice for my new one year old rescue dog named Mi Cha she’s a mixed breed but thinking a staffordshire bull terrier. I got her around a week ago and all that I know of her history is that she was a stray and was picked up by a mom with a son high on the spectrum who would frequently “be loud” with the dog. She seems to find them with noises unless she’s in a state of fear for example, if she sees one of my roommates and start growling, and then we go to my bedroom. Then she’s alert about any sound probably for the next 15 minutes. Today I’m going to call and ask for her surrender forms. She loves my one roommate, but growls at the others. I want to save up to get her into training. This is a problem. The shelter said she does best meeting people in open settings like outdoors. (My other two roommates not really trying to get her to meet strangers right now because it’s only been a week. I want to give it at least three weeks or three months.) she’s never lunged at anyone, she has ran up to one of the girls, but still sat away from her and just barked. When we’ve done two days in a row of them individually meeting outside my other roommate the dog loves, brings them out with her while I sit with her outside in hopes that would make her more comfortable. They greet her with excitement. I let them know that to act confident and they have treats. They’ve played fetch, but she’ll go back to barking eventually. It all kinda goes down the drain once we’re inside. I don’t know if it’s just because she’s still getting used to her own environment, at the vet she did just fine. My other roommates think it’s because they’re black, but… idk I don’t really think that’s a thing I could be so wrong though. I’m Asian the roommate who adopted her was white. Staff at the shelter was pretty diverse. On Mi Cha’s first day home when she was with my roommate, I left for a bit and one of them when she started barking, jumped on top of our counter, which I don’t think helps anything. The same roommate is afraid of the dog. I think she can sense that. I just don’t understand because in the shelter she did just fine with people. I took her for a walk yesterday at a people park but very early in the morning in hopes I wouldn’t see a lot of others. She barked at them and pulled towards them, but I held her without petting her, but had my back away from them facing her without making eye contact with her. When the people had finally passed a distance, she started whining, keeping an eye out for them, which I think just means she’s really afraid. Any advice would help I don’t really know if I knew what I was getting myself into because the shelter just noticed she seemed to be very fearful. Apparently, upon her intake, she was growling at everybody and then she did all right. I come on Reddit because I don’t know there’s a lot smarter people on this subject matter. She’s my first dog and she’s been doing really well potty training wise, she doesn’t seem to display aggression with food nor high value objects like her toys. 
I really don’t wanna surrender her and I probably just need to give it more time.  I just know extensive training is a lot more than I can afford as a college kid. It feels like I’m taking the right approaches. She’s not obviously just locked in my room for the day she rooms. Unless if I know my roommates need to go to the kitchen or something this isn’t fair to anyone though I think that’s more shameful about it. Any training advice again would help I feel like I’m going in circles at this point, but that’s the rundown.",1732130844.0

I am a life long dog owner (specifically shit tzu but also gun dogs ect). This week is tgiving week and I work in Fashion. I am also in business school. The combination of Black Friday and the beginning of finals is making my life very busy. 

My boyfriend’s sister sprung dogsitting on us last minute. She is going away for tgiving with my bfs family. I can’t physically leave my apartment rn due to he and work to go dog sit the dog in its home. I literally can’t bring my whole work desk, meds, and fashion event outfits with me (lol). 

The dog is a shi poo and I offered to take care of the dog at my apartment but my bf refuses. The dog does live in a house but we can take it on walks and accommodate its outdoor time needs. Also we live on a 4th floor walk up but I explained to my bf that we can just pick the dog up and carry it up the stairs. Also we can leave it in the bathroom when we are gone. My whole life my family took care of dogs for friends at our house. Ik the dog is neurotic but I can’t physically go with my bf to the dogs house.

dogs,TW: Slightly morbid question wrt my late Alsatian ,"Hi all!   
I’m so sorry to bring such a morbid and potentially upsetting question to the sub, if you aren’t in a spot to read something regarding the death of a dog, GDV/bloat, or are quite sensitive to things of this nature, please dont read on.

I grew up with my Alsatian/GSD mix rescue, Junie, for half my entire life—twelve years old till i was twenty four. she was my absolute best friend in the world, my sister and my guardian angel. her death last year hit me incredibly hard, which is why ive spent the last year debating whether or not I actually want to know the information or answer I’m looking for here. 

she was always a very very healthy girl, and remained active and spirited right up until her last week of life—though she had arthritic back legs which no longer could support her, with my partner and i holding her hind legs in a sling, she ran down the beach chasing her siblings with the biggest smile, just two days before she passed. 

her issue arose quickly and unexpectedly in the form of GDV. I was able to recognise the signs well enough to suspect what it was, and she was rushed to the emergency vet where she had the gas removal procedure under anaesthesia. Though it was a risk due to her age, she went through the procedure just fine and the vet assured us that the bloat had subsided and she would be absolutely fine. We took her home,  put her in her bed next to my side of the bed, and though i did stay awake for an hour or so, i fell asleep around 5AM, with Junie sleeping completely normally beside me (Small shifts and stretches, normal breathing). 

four hours later i woke up suddenly and immediately looked over at her, but saw her unmoving. Id prefer not to expand too much here since it’s difficult for me to recall, emotionally. She had passed away at some point in the last four hours, but from the point of view of medical normalcy, nothing seemed out of the ordinary for what would have been expected. 

my question lies in this—though everything else seemed like a death you’d expect from what were  complications from GDV, there was something which i noticed that always stuck with me. The leg of a nearby chair had been chewed quite badly, and she had bits of the chewed-up chair leg around her mouth. I have always thought it may have been that she was in pain and thats why she chewed on the chair.  it hurt so badly knowing I was asleep when I should’ve been  with her in those moments so she maybe wouldn’t have needed to resort to that, but I just need to know for certain. I’m trying my best to work through the guilt of falling asleep that night and feel like it would at least help me stop wondering  why she did what she did in her final moments. Whether it was pain, fear, or confusion, I want to understand so I can (in some sort of universal way) apologise to her. 

\[I’d also ask that if you feel inclined to be harsh in any criticisms you may have of me/my handling of the situation, please please do your best to mitigate the harshness. I’m self-admittedly incredibly sensitive, and U assure you all I take complete onus for falling asleep that night, trusting the vet implicitly, and not doing something/anything more— that weight has not even slightly subsided a year later.\]

thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope all your dogs are doing incredibly well. If you havent yet, I’d urge you to use this as your sign research signs of GDV and preemptively understand emergency procedures available within your means. And maybe send a lil treat to Junie in heaven, she’s the best girl. ",1732068598.0

dogs,New Dog is Not as She Seemed ...,"This weekend I adopted a rescue dog after years of considering/getting to the right place in life to add a dog to the picture. These first few days have made me question my decision as I (struggle to) adapt to the new routine required and the general disruption to my life. This is normal though right? The internet tells me it's normal.

The bigger annoyance is I feel slightly misled by the rescue who I adopted from. Don't get me wrong, she's a breeze/perfect inside, but outside she's terrible on leash and quite dog reactive. It's not that I'm unwilling to put in the work/work with a trainer/whatever it takes but it would have been nice to know ahead of time what I'm getting into. Mentally I was unprepared for this based on the information from the rescue. 

tl;dr I'm pretty sure some of this is normal frustration/adjustment/etc. but some validation/reminder wouldn't hurt!

dogs,Can I train my dog to like soft toys without ripping them apart?,"I have the sweetest 5 y/o Newfie with quite a few quirks. He's not huge on toys, but that's partially because I can't give him anything soft or he'll rip it apart, lol. He loves playing ball with rubber balls, and he takes good care of those (even the squeaky ones), but anything soft, he immediately lays down with it and begins systematically ripping it apart. It's something he thoroughly enjoys doing, so every once in a while I give him a soft tennis ball or something and just let him go at it. Thankfully he doesn't eat the pieces.

When he was a puppy, I got him all kinds of cute, fluffy animal toys, and he always shredded them, but I guess I just thought that was normal puppy behavior (and it was great to divert him from chewing my rugs and furniture). However I guess that taste for ripping cute little fake animals apart came with him into adulthood. What's funny is that he is more gentle than any dog I've ever met with other animals of all sizes and kinds. He loves squirrels and bunnies but I swear if he actually reached one, he would just sniff it and want to play. He LOVES my 5-lb cat even though she despises him and punches him in the face daily. So it's definitely not a prey drive thing, I don't think?

Like I said, he's 5. I definitely don't want to cause any distress or anything. But is this something I could train him out of? He's very food motivated (more than toys) so there's that. I just would love to be able to give him a few cute fluffy toys that he takes good care of, and chew on without actually tearing apart.",1732039346.0

dogs,[help] Looking for some sturdy running booties!,"We recently moved to the PNW, and playing fetch in a yard with greenery (as opposed to turf) has been difficult for my lil’ staffy girl. The best way to keep her happy, healthy, and tired is to play 20 mins of fetch twice a day. Unfortunately, there’s tons of little sticks and it’s been slicing up her paws. We do try to rake, etc, but she is almost violently in love with tennis balls and completely disregards her own safety when it comes down to catching them. Ideally, we would make a strip of turf for her to run up and down, but that’s not in the budget right now.

So I’m trying to find a good pair of dog boots that are a) durable enough not to tear in the first five minutes of wear (looking at you, Youly “Adventure” boots) and b) won’t come flying off when she hits top speed. We do have cute lil’ rain boots for when she goes on a walk, but while they stay on, they tear on the bottom as soon as she gets into it.

Anyone have some good recommendations?",1732035594.0

I have two small dogs 3 year old Chihuahua mix (not sure the other mix, maybe Jindo) and a 4 year old Terrier Mix (no idea about the other mix).

I can’t figure out how to get them to play with toys or more enrichment activities.
They are only interested in chasing squirrels and on the rare occasions, chasing each other and “play fighting” in our backyard. 
We occasionally use the sniffle mat because we don’t want to overload them with treats.

They aren’t interested in playing catch/ball (any ball thrown at them, they either try to avoid or just do nothing) and they don’t care for tugging.

They only seem to like going for walks and smelling everything. The terrier mix seems to like to pick fights with any dog that they see… ugh, someone said that maybe it’s to protect the other dog.

I intend to incorporate him into most of my activities, whenever safe and possible for the dog.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

dogs,"Boss fights & dogs, any advice?","So Pumkin can be a little bit of a brat, I’ve never yelled at her before because she’s not doing anything wrong, but she likes to jump in my lap mid boss fight when I’m playing a game, & it’s cost me the battle on a couple of occasions, but oh well 🤷🏼‍♀️

So when I go to rematch the boss that Pumkin made sure killed me, I encourage Pumkin to sit with me BEFORE it starts if she already jumped down.

But nope. Ofc not… because sitting in my lap before a boss fight starts makes too much sense, she has to jump in my lap mid boss fight ",1731982988.0
dogs,Looking for a small/medium breed that won't chase foxes ,"
For context, our garden backs into a mound where foxes have a den. The den is past the limit of the property and there is a fence in place, however a dog standing in the garden would be able to see them. I was hoping to get small to medium breed recommendations that are less likely to get rilled up by foxes and less likely to bother them. Thank you! 

Questionnaire:

dogs,Lancaster buys puppy from puppy mills like Greenfield ,"
A Trip Around Lancaster, PA: Our Visit to Six Breeders Selling Puppies Online
Recently, Stop Online Puppy Mills took a trip to Lancaster County, PA, to visit six licensed dog breeders selling puppies online. What we found behind the beautiful homes and pristine exteriors was a troubling reality for the dogs bred and sold at these facilities. Here’s what we uncovered during our eye-opening journey.

Dachshund Puppies with Mange Around the Eyes
At one young breeder’s home, we were greeted with the sight of dachshund puppies with mange around their eyes. These poor puppies had hair loss around the eyes and in spots on their heads. While the puppies were presented to us in a pen in the front yard, it was clear they were not receiving proper care.

The puppies were being sold for $1,200 and when we asked about the hair loss he explained it was from nursing, despite the fact that the puppies had been weened and were eating sold food. When we asked to see the mother dog and where she lived, the breeder refused, citing concerns about “disease.”

Fad Colored French Bulldog Puppies with No Health Testing
One of the online sellers listed a litter of “fad-colored” French Bulldogs. These colors are non standard colors including blue eyes. Breeders selling puppies with these colors are considered irresponsible, exploiting the breed and careless in breeding practices by the French Bulldog Club of America.

What truly caught our attention was the heartbreaking condition of their mother. She was only 3 years old but had already been bred five times, the breeder said she was a good momma. Her coat was patchy with visible hair loss and poor confirmation. The most disturbing moment came when the breeder held her down by the scruff of her neck, forcing her head flat against the ground, explaining she wasn’t used to being outside of her cage. The contrast between her miserable mental and physical conditions and the $2,000 price tag on her puppies was a chilling reminder of the cruelty that hides behind the beautiful websites selling puppies online.

CK6 Breeders with Over 500 Dogs
Two of the largest breeders we visited each housed over 500 dogs according to their licenses. These breeders primarily supplied puppies to pet stores, but with pet store sales slowing down, they both started selling their puppies directly to the public, “retail” via online platforms. Because they do not use electricity or modern technology, they candidly spoke about how the online platform send photographers to take high-quality photos of the puppies. The photos, combined with made up names and descriptions of each puppy, are then uploaded online by the platform to entice buyers.

While the websites looked polished and professional, we were not allowed to look inside the several buildings that housed the dogs, again with the excuse of potential disease spreading. This lack of transparency raises serious questions about the conditions of these dogs.

A Chicken Farmer, A Heifer Farmer, and A Mumm Farmer
Among the breeders we visited, three farmers who primarily raised chickens, cows, and mums (flowers), also ran profitable dog breeding businesses on the side. Despite their other farming operations, these breeders still sold puppies online as an additional lucrative source of income. The chicken farmer had over 100 dogs in his breeding kennel along with housing and record keeping violations. The heifer farmer had close 300 dogs in his kennel along with direct violations stating untreated painful eye injuries on multiple dogs. The mumm farmer was selling high priced designer dogs as a lucrative side income.

Each had set up a room in their home where families could meet the puppies. However, when asked to meet the mother dogs or see inside the breeding buildings, we were told no—again citing “disease” as the reason for denying access. It was clear that these puppies were being sold as commodities, no different than the other livestock or goods these farmers produced.

Timid and Lethargic Puppies
At all six breeders we visited, we encountered puppies that were timid, lethargic, and appeared visibly unhealthy. Many were thin, with dull coats and clear signs of emotional distress. Some puppies cowered behind furniture, barely acknowledging our presence, revealing a stark lack of proper socialization. Despite the farmers’ children being present in an attempt to create an atmosphere of care, the puppies’ withdrawn behavior told a different story. Some were energetic but noticeably underweight and small. We were concerned about the physical and emotional well-being of all of the puppies we saw, not to mention their mother and fathers.

Selling “Retail” to the Public
Interestingly, two of the large breeders openly admitted that they had resorted to selling “retail”—directly to the public online—because their pet store partners were not selling their puppies fast enough. To these breeders, the puppies were openly just inventory. They mentioned that the website gives them sheets on each puppy that lists the puppy’s online name and pertinent information about the puppy so they know which puppy the family is calling about. The websites also provide the breeders sheets to show the public and a folder if the puppy is sold. One breeder showed us a page that included a QR code in the sale package so customers can leave reviews right from their phones. He was proud to say the reviews go directly to his online profile, further perpetuating the illusion of legitimacy.

Beautiful Homes, Breeding Buildings, Hidden Cruelty
One of the most shocking aspects of our visits was how these breeders lived in beautifully kept updated remodeled homes, with spacious rooms dedicated to hosting potential puppy buyers. On the surface, it looked like a responsible breeding operation. But beneath the surface, these breeders were hiding the truth: we were repeatedly denied access to the mother dogs and the breeding buildings where the mother dogs and other breeding stock dogs were kept. This stark contrast between the charming public-facing rooms and the unseen reality of the breeding dogs and buildings were deeply unsettling.

What We Learned
These breeders represent a large part of the puppy-selling industry—using the appeal of their simple heritage, picturesque homes, and friendly fronts to sell puppies online. However, they carefully control what buyers see, creating an illusion of transparency while hiding the grim realities of large-scale breeding operations. Driven by profit, the health and well-being of the dogs are secondary, and even though buyers may feel reassured by clean rooms and friendly breeder interactions, they are not seeing the whole picture.

Stop Online Puppy Mills is committed to educating the public about these deceptive practices and how high volume commercial dog breeders sell puppies online hiding behind beautiful websites. These breeders, who are supposed to be caring for the animals in their charge, are profiting from their suffering. When buyers purchase puppies online, they are often unknowingly supporting this system of exploitation.",1731966069.0
dogs,Curious what the community would recommend here. Thanks!,"    **Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * No, I owned a dog growing up and have owned two dogs as an adult. One of these was raised from a puppy.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * Prefer rescue, but am a bit wary with younger children and cats in the home. Ideally would like to rescue a puppy so we can ensure proper socialization.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * I would like a dog that is good with kids, won't kill our cats, is a good companion for the family, easier to train, medium to larger size dog, intelligent, and can handle longer walks. My ideal dog would not be aggressive/reactive towards guests or children as we have lots of activity in our home. 
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * I have been doing research into the following breeds: German Shepherd, Bernese Mountain Dog, Border Collie, Labrador Retriever, Eurasier, Greyhound, and Golden Retriever. I really love the idea of a German Shepherd but worry about them being too protective for our environment. Also love the Bernese Mountain Dog but have concerns about their lifespans.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Walk with a loose leash, obey basic and intermediate commands, play gently with kids, be good with guests and strangers, interact with other dogs in healthy ways (on walks or at dog park), and be a companion to the family.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * No and none.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * Honestly whatever it takes. We work from home and have an awesome teenager, so can devote substantial time to training and playing from multiple family members.
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * Trail walking (not hiking) anywhere from 30-120 minutes a day. Also play in the yard. Open to going to dog parks, but haven't done so before.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * Yes, willing to do grooming. The only thing I don't want is to deal with a lot of drool/slobber.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Medium to large.
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * Moderate to high shedding, low to moderate barking, and zero to low slobber.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * Not important.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Either is fine. We don't need a dog to be a cuddler and understand dog signals enough to respect personal space and boundaries.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * Probably closer to eager to please from a training and companionship perspective. However, I don't mind a dog that is confident and comfortable doing its own thing.
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * I would like a dog to alert me to people knocking at the door but to follow my cues on how to proceed. I would like the dog to greet strangers and visitors either warmly or with minimal interest. We have kids coming in and out of the house frequently and our dog MUST not pose a danger to them.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * Yes. We don't have other dogs and don't plan on more than one.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * Aggression towards children and people is the deal-breaker. We can work with most anything else. Unmanageable prey drive would also be hard (we have cats) although we could figure out how to keep the animals separate.
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * Very rarely. We work from home and I am a homebody already. I'd ideally have the dog with me in my office when not walking/exercising/training.
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * Our preferences are aligned. The only concern is we have a younger child so need a dog that will be safe with kids.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * We have three cats. I would like to adopt a cat-friendly dog or a puppy so we can socialize them. We also have a bunny in the home, but she is kept in her enclosure with door closed at all times.
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * Yes.
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * No.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * Denver, Colorado. There are pit bull restrictions here, but I am not sure of any other laws.
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * Summer can hit 100 degrees F and winter can go below zero, though these are rarer. More common that we are between 10-40F in winter and 65-90F in summer.

dogs,Enrichment Suggestions for 4y/o Mix?,"I recently adopted a dog from my local shelter, and she has been a great addition! However, I am worried about her being bored while I am away at work for most of the day. She does OK in her crate, as it is very large and has lots of space for her to move around and lay down in different positions. She has shown some signs of anxiety that I am hoping might just be related to being a new pet... I am hopeful that time and enrichment will help her out!

For context on her, she is approximately 4 years old and is a 30ish pound terrier mix. She has a chase drive for sure, but when she is crated she can't be chasing things much of course. She gets up every so often to cry and try to get out of the crate, so I am hoping some enrichment in the crate will help with that as well. (She has not succeeded yet but I do not want her to hurt herself in the process of trying to escape...)

Any tips or tricks, products, etc would all be helpful! She is not my first dog, but she is the first dog I have had that is more intensely focused and in need of more enrichment. (My first dog was an old man at heart.)",1731956630.0

In mid September I was told that it would be fixed sometime in early October and then, I was told it would be fixed by the end of October.

dogs,Potty (re)training an adult dog,"I have a 5 year old female dog I need to re-potty train and I am really torn on how to navigate a training schedule with my work schedule. Please let me know of anything I might be missing, I'm desperate. Here's the history and plan.

History: Got her when she was a puppy and fully house-trained her using usual tactics. When she was 1, my then-boyfriend moved in with his couple-months old puppy, who was also house-trained. I'm not sure what happened but they both started going to the bathroom in the house when unsupervised. It was been hell ever since. The other dog moved out 2 years ago and my dog is still having accidents in the house. Sometimes she will not have any accidents for a few weeks (like 3-4 max). But for the most part, I pick up poop a few times a week and pee about once per week. I swear I take her outside many times per day and she does go outside too. I just can't deal with this for another (hopeful) 10 years. It's embarrassing and honestly just degrading to constantly clean up the messes. I have all hardwood flooring downstairs and carpet upstairs. I even replaced the carpet and painted a layer of Kilz on the subfloor to eliminate the urine scent after the other dog moved out.

Plan: Deep clean my floors/carpet with an enzyme cleaner. I will take her outside every 30 min. If she goes potty, she will get supervised free time inside. If she does not go potty, she will go in the crate for 30 min. Regardless, back outside every 30 min. I will keep her crated when I'm not home. Rinse and repeat for few days and lengthe I have 2 weeks off work coming up and will pretty much be home for the most part, only leaving for a few hours at a time and can be dedicated. 

My questions:

1. I work 12 hour shifts, which is a long time to be crated. I do go home on my lunch breaks (so crated for about 6 hours, let out, then another 6 hours). But come winter, I'm not able to go home every single shift, depending on the weather. Sometimes I get mandated at work, so even with coming home on break, she could still be crated for 10 hours at a time (not often, but still). That feels like too long. Will she need to be crated forever when I am not home, once she is fully trained for a few months? 

2. She has accidents when I am sleeping. Do I need to crate her when I sleep too? Would keeping her leashed/tied to my bedpost near me suffice? Or might she start to eliminate right there? She always sleeps in my room, my room is actually the only in the house she hasn't gone to the bathroom in and I'd hate for that to change.",1731927334.0

I've considered rehoming but I don't want to do that at all they are family. But they can't keep getting out it's dangerous. Is there low cost ways to fortify the fence to stop the climbing? ,1731946242.0
dogs,Border Collie vs Samoyed,"Hello fellow dog lovers in r/dogs. I am a 24M in Malaysia looking to get a dog and I am leaning towards Border Collies and Samoyeds.

* **Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?** I had a family dog when I was young (\~7 years old), it was a mongrel that my family rescued. Not much training involved except potty training. Took care of her for a few years until she passed 2 years ago.

I can commit more hours on Thursday and Friday, but Malaysia is pretty hot during noon and afternoon. I have access to dog parks on Saturday and Sunday. There are also indoor dog playgrounds 15 minutes away.

    * We're really stuck between two breeds so would appreciate opinions for both, we're swayed to a long haired mini dachshund as have heard they are less barky. We also think their energy levels match us better than a cocker spaniel. However, we lean towards a cocker spaniel for their temperament and eagerness to learn and know they can be calm if their needs are met.

I’ve been planning to warm up a bit so I can practice my tone, emphasis, and all the other stuff that makes hearing a story really engaging. 

Would reading aloud while my dog hangs out on the couch be enriching in any way? Or maybe help with bonding?

Seems like it could be relaxing and nice to have him get used to my voice.

Before he would just lay down, and go to sleep, or cuddle up to me and give me some kisses before sleep. However the last few days he will get in bed, and sit and just sort of act like he does not know what to do. I do not know if it is just his anxiety. I try to pet him, and get him to lie down. He just kind of looks rather upset. He has his ears back. After about 5 to 10 minutes he will finally lay down.

dogs,"Adopting a ""confident"" senior dog when already owning a ""fearful"" adult dog?","My partner and I adopted a dog estimated to be a year old in 2019. A different vet later estimate he was more likely to be 8 months old. He's a good boy but afraid of the world. Whens he's in a spot where there are more dogs than humans (day care) he becomes much more comfortable. He gets along well with other dogs, he'll give a warning growl when he needs to and has never had an incident with another dog. He has shown protectiveness of our bed and recently the couch so he has lost access to both.

My partner and I have been thinking about adopting a senior but are worried our dog won't like to ""share"" his home. I brought this up with the vet who said that submissive dogs like him sometimes have an easier time in the world when they have a more confident dog to look up to.

dogs,Struggling with decision about foster dog,"A couple weeks ago, I brought home a golden retriever mix to hopefully foster-to-adopt.  I have a small poodle mix who is pretty fearful, and I knew it would take work to successfully introduce them.  We were making slow but steady progress and had gotten to the point where they were going outside together (with foster dog on a leash) and spending very short periods in the same room with supervision.  Then the other night the poodle was bouncing around acting playful, golden tried to join in, poodle got scared, golden ignored his cues and kept trying to engage, and poodle started growling and chasing him off rather aggressively.  Golden kind of joined in- not 100% sure if he was seriously fighting or just amped up and reacting.  Golden has also showed some resource guarding behavior that I fear could end badly if the poodle decided to challenge him (which I think he eventually would, because he and my first dog got into it a few times over food, bones, etc.).

Part of me wants to keep working at it, keep trying to get the poodle to calm down and not be so fearful, try to teach the golden some manners, etc.  But my gut says this just isn't a good match.  If the poodle was just scared and avoiding the golden, I think it would get better with time.  If they were closer to the same size, I would be inclined to give it time and let them work things out a little.  But with the poodle showing more fear aggression, I am scared of what could happen if an actual fight broke out between a 16 lb dog and an 80 lb dog.

I'm feeling really down about this whole situation.  I'm exhausted from trying to meet the needs of both dogs while keeping them separated.  I feel like I'm letting the golden down by taking him back to the shelter.  I know it's not a failure per se, but I feel bad that things don't seem to be working out.  I said goodbye to my first dog earlier this year, and it was already a hard decision to adopt again.  I just really wanted this to work.",1731792250.0

dogs,Online Breed Quizzes are confusing! ,"Hello lovely people 🥹

I have been binge-consuming educational content about dogs and contemplating the idea of getting one for quite some time now, but I have been struggling with figuring out which breed would be most suitable to my personality and lifestyle.

Unfortunately, I have been quite overwhelmed from the breed quizzes I have made so far, especially after researching a suggested one’s traits in an independence source for it to turn out to be quite the opposite of my requirements. So here I am in the hands of this awesome community! 



1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

First time dog owner. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I would prefer to go through a reputable breeder. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

I work from home for most of the time and even when I am not, my schedule can be worked up so the dog is not left alone. 
I am moderately active person and depending on the mood I can be either a cuddly couch potato or doing a hardcore hike, so a dog tolerating days with low activity and being able to jump on a hike during the weekend, would be a match made in heaven. 
I also have to drive (~5hrs) occasionally to visit family members, so being able to take the dog with me would be awesome. Also, I can very well imagine going on a road trip with it every now and then. 
Enjoying socialisation with adults/babies and animals would be a huge bonus.
I would also love to spend time training my dog doing more than just sit/stay and for it to be easily trainable for a first time dog owner. 
I don’t really have fur preferences, but maybe I would get annoyed if big balls of hairs are flying all over the place.



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

No preferences. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Beyond sit/stay and bond through obedience.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I imagine myself spending a couple of hours on a daily basis interacting/playing with my dog and training it for up to an hour per day.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I can accommodate at least 2*30 minutes walks on busy days and more on not so busy days. 
Playing fetch in the yard is also possible, but I don’t see myself running with the dog. 🤭 
Dog park can be accommodated but not on a daily basis.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am open to doing this at home. I would prefer not to attend to extreme brushing needs due to a lot of shedding.

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

I would prefer a large/medium dog breed, if that is suitable for a 60 sq. m./ 645 sq. ft. apartment. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Moderate. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

I would say that this is moderate-high priority. 

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A snuggly, cuddly one to the front, please! 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager-to-please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Curiosity, friendliness. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I am confident I could manage that with the right tools, but would prefer not to as a first time dog owner.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Aggressiveness, disobedience. 

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

On rear occasions, no longer than 2-3 hours.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Mostly the same.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Not for now, but I am open to the possibility of having a cat.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not very often, but it is not completely out of the picture. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I am home-owner.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in Sofia, Bulgaria (biggest city in the country). I am not aware of any breeds being banned.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

We still have 4 seasons, max. temperatures during the summer would be 35 C/ 95 F, but not on any day. Winters are getting milder with occasional snows.

dogs,Shelter dog regressing?,"I am a volunteer dog walker and cuddler at my local shelter.

My mom works from home so she thinks that’s enough for the dog bc she’s “not alone all day” even tho when my mom is working she’s not giving the dog attention.  This baby needs lots of socialization. I’m a masters student and simply don’t have time or energy to come home to play w her. AITA for resenting both the dog and my parents for making this irresponsible decision? She wakes me up by jumping on me. If I close my door she barks at it. She whines all the time for attention when I’m trying to concentrate on homework. My parents are in Lala land and barely do anything w her, they have the busiest social lives. It’s so damn annoying and I feel bad bc she’s a good dog but just requires a lot of attention she’s not getting from the 2 ppl who CHOSE to get her. Has this happened to anyone else? Can anyone resonate w this feeling? I didn’t asked for this dog and of course I love her now that she’s a part of my family but it’s showing me that I absolutely do not want the responsibility of a pet when I move out. ",1731633142.0
dogs,Dog dilemma ,"I’m going to Uni in a year, currently I live with my parents in a small and hot country where it’s very humid. So to not over exert my dog we always walk her in the morning or late night when the sun is gone. We live in a condo in a quite large apartment where can dog can roam around freely and we bring her down every 4hours to pee. 

Here’s the dilemma since I’m going to Uni, I want to bring my dog along to give her a sense of a world where it’s cold and changing weather, along with large plains in the country side since there’s no country side in my country. I’ve looked at a few Uni where they accept dogs in their facilities but the rooms, I feel is too small for my dog. There’s barely space for her cage, bed, food, water, and her. 
I’ve looked for shared houses but so far only found 1 where they accept dogs. 

Another thing is that if I do bring my dog along, it’s stop travelling for me as there would be no one that could take care of her for free and bills ( I plan on working) would take all the money I have. 

So I was wondering if I should take her along and continue my search for houses and ways to bring my dog along, or if I should leave her with my parents. ",1731627975.0
dogs,"Looking to adopt a puppy come spring, need advice on sorting through what's available.","**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I trained my family dog(Lhasa/Shi Tzu) in childhood, and he became relatively obedient, but have not owned one myself.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I will likely be getting my puppy from either the SPCA or a nearby farm.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Laid back, medium to large sized, cold tolerant, and reasonably trainable.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Basic obedience commands, recall.

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I have as much time as I need for training any puppy I get, but my workload is seasonal, so I become very busy over the winter and would probably have an hour a day in Nov/Dec/Jan(though my wife will be around during the day to let it outside and such, it's going to be my dog and I will be planning on doing at least 80% of the work. She prefers cats.)

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* 1 hour a day split into two walks, plus some fetch in the yard. I have 8000sqft on my lot so plenty of room to play with any dog. 9 months of the year I can do more, but during my busy season only the above.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am fine with weekly grooming, but would prefer not to have to brush out my dog daily. As for professional grooming, we currently take our cats twice a year, and I would plan to do the same with any dog.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* I would prefer a medium to large size dog

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is fine, though less is better. My wife dislikes slobber quite strongly. I would prefer a dog that doesn't bark constantly, but will react to people passing by my back yard.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Nice to have but not mandatory.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggles are fine but not necessary, don't have a strong preference.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I'd like a dog that's independent-minded, even if it makes training a bit more difficult. 

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* I am okay with a dog that is cautious around strangers, and in fact would like one that would not let random people in the back-yard. 

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I'd prefer not to but its not a dealbreaker.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Howling at night, anything too smart(my aunt had a 1/4 coyote 1/4 wolf 1/2 mutt and the intelligence was a huge pain in the ass. Was capable of holding grudges and formulating plots to get back at people sneakily), can't have anything that'll chase the cats. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 4-5 hours while my wife is at work, more days than not. Rarely more than that.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My wife will be home at times while I am at work, and can make sure the dog is checked on, let out to relieve itself, etc. But I will be putting in 80% of the effort here. She has no preferences besides a lack of drool, and an affinity towards Blue Heelers because that was her childhood dog.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have two one-year-old Turkish Van Cats. We dogsat for a friend as a test and they did alright.

No other pets are currently planned.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Nope, own my own place

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Canada, specifically Northern Saskatchewan

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Winter: Average temperature in coldest month of -17C. Average min temperature of -24C overnight. 
* Summer: Average temperature in hottest month of 18C. Average max temperature during day of 24C.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* This dog will be mostly in my yard during the warm months, and then when the temperature dips below freezing will be kept inside. I have a huge problem with homeless people transiting through my yard, depositing garbage, breaking the locks to my fence to do so. A large dog should dissuade them. They tend to go to ground over the winter so I have few problems then. Consequently, whatever dog I get needs to be okay with being outside most of the time, but also okay being inside lots.
* Where I am, availability is very consistent for all manner of working dogs, retrievers, and livestock guardians. I consistently see litters that are mixes of collies/shepherds/retrievers/etc. What I have been considering most strongly is a Golden or Lab crossed with a Great Pyrenees, as they seem to be readily available and match my needs reasonably well. I don't have the ability to get any particularly rare or out-there breeds, I'm simply too isolated. I looked into a Bergamesco but the trip out to get one would cost me over two grand including lost wages...",1731624736.0
dogs,I have some questions as a first time puppy owner (long post),"So im a teen, i live in a smallish house (this info will later make sense) and about 4 days ago i got my first puppy who is 2 months old. Ive been having some ups and downs related to them and thats why i made this post.

Also i apologize if the flair is wrong, there werent any question related flairs!

For a starter, i share 2 cats and a bunny whos mainly in a large cage, and ive decided with my mother (who has trained 2 dogs before) that letting the pup be in my room only at the moment. Me and my mum share a room, im on a bigger proper bed and shes on an air matress, all of the time the puppy can free roam in my room, we cant really potty train the pup at the moment as its pretty cold outside, and we tried to take her for a walk outside 3 days ago, but the puppy was too interested in the surroundings and ended up being pretty cold and shivering so we took her inside and wrapped her in a blanket. We dont have any jackets for the pup at the moment but are planning to. So far we havent let her outside anymore and decided to start potty training next week as im going to be home alone this weekend (at the moment the puppy does all their business rly nicely on those pads that go on the floor)

The question with that is, any tips for going outside with this weather? And how to teach them to do it only outside as we cant be outside for more than 5 minutes to avoid her starting to shiver from the cold.

Currently our routine is waking up at around 10am, cuddling/napping until 12pm, food at 12pm, calmly the first 60 minutes to be sure their stomach doesent get twisted, then playtime as much as they want until 3pm, around 3pm is next feeding, calmly, playfully and then napping until 9pm, ood, and then sleep time. Currently the puppy sleeps with my mum in her bed at night and at cuddling or napping time in the morning shes with me in my mums bed. 

Here is where i really need help, how do i get her not so attached to me? If im outside of my room for 10 secs or more shell start whining and scratching at the door, the only time that doesent happen is if shes occupied aka with my mother in the room. We cant really let her roam in the other rooms beacause of the cats, we dont know how theyll get along (yes im aware of a house line, but my mums not so sure on using it), and the other rooms are not puppy proofed (we have alot of stuff so its hard to puppy proof, we dont have alot of cabinets or storage spots)

Random note: my room is fully puppy proof, wide range of toys, no cages or pens as we had a pen until yesterday beacause it didnt have a good affect on the pup, causing her stress and big seperation anxiety (even if she was right next to my bed with it), could hardly get her to calm down in it if she was awake. And she doesent only get fed the food from those plastic packets, also kibble every time the bowl gets empty as she doesent eat it as much.

dogs,"Just how intuitive are dogs,  anyway?","I’ve had my rescue dog Athena for 2 years (she is 4). She is my first dog, and we are very attached to each other. She is very human-centric in general.

Like many dogs, she responds differently to different people - for example, she’s more naturally trusting of new females than new males. A lot of dogs have things like that. 

But she also seems to “sense” my deeper feelings about individual people that should, on the surface, seem the same to her. Sort of like how your 7-year-old just “knows” which sister is your favorite, despite you being quite sure you’ve never talked about that. 

Have other people experienced this? In your opinion, is it possible that my dog (or all dogs) are that intuitive? Can their reactions - which sometimes seem unpredictable on the surface - tell us more about our own minds?

Or am I just high?

Well, I guess it’s not really an either/or.

dogs,Satisfying chewing,"It just occurred to me that dogs evolved to crack marrow out of bones for their nutrition. Obviously that is bad for their health now, but I can see where chewing in that sense is satisfying for them. I know and have been following the rule that anything that doesn’t indent from my nail is too hard for my dog to chew BUT:

Is there a way to give my dog the satisfaction of cracking a bone without ruining his teeth?",1731557537.0
dogs,"Am First Responder, first time single with dog","I have an almost three year old Bull Terrier. My girlfriend and I are breaking up. 

I work 3pm-140am for 5 days, and have 4 and 5 day weekends. I plan on finding a neighbor to let him out around 8-9 pm on my work weeks.

He mainly sleeps in the daytime, and gets some energy bursts at night, but he does excellent in a crate. Sometimes he won’t ask to go potty and it’s been 12 hours (usually from evening-early afternoon time). 

I would let my girlfriend take him but she does not prioritize walking and behavior training like I do. 

I guess I’m looking for input if having a dog walker is still okay. This is a stressful time and my boy means the world to me.

dogs,Chihuahua? Toy poodle? Need help picking a breed!,"\*\* Hey everyone! I’m looking to get a puppy in the next yearish and I’m totally overstressing about what breed to choose lol. I grew up around a dog that had a lot of issues and it caused a lot of stress and heartache so I’m just feeling really strongly about making sure I get a well bred and good tempered dog. Any advice from y'all would be so appreciated! \*\*



1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?



\* I grew up around a dog but this will be my first time owning a dog and being responsible for it. I’m familiar with dogs and dog training.



2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?



\* Definitely want to go through a reputable breeder. It’s really important to me to get a dog that is predictable.



3)	Describe your ideal dog.



\* I want a very small, friendly lap dog. I want a dog that will snuggle with me and sleep in my bed. I want it to be cool with lots of walks and can come with me everywhere. I want it to be friendly towards people and at least neutral around other dogs. I definitely want a girl dog. I have a 1 year old cat who is my first priority since she’s already here, so I want to be careful to do whatever I can to make living with a dog easy for her and not lower her quality of life.



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



\* I have really fallen in love with long haired chihuahuas. I love how tiny and portable they are and I think they are super cute. I know looks aren’t the most important thing when choosing a breed but I can’t help but care somewhat lol, as much as I hate to admit that. I’m a little concerned about the temperament of chihuahuas though. I’m seeing a lot of conflicting info online…some saying they are super sweet and friendly and others saying they are one person dogs and don’t like strangers. I have also taken toy poodles into consideration, but I don’t love their look as much (I know, I shouldn't care) and I’m not sure I’m up for the grooming. I would definitely be keeping it in a short cut. Papillons are another on my list but I’m worried they might be a little too sporty and high energy for me. I went back and forth on cavaliers but ultimately decided the health problems are not worth it for me with them. Breeds like Shi-Tzu's and Maltese seem to have the right temperament but again, the grooming, and I'm also not crazy about how they look 😬.



5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?



\* Pretty much just basic obedience and manners. Maybe some tricks for fun.



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?



\* No.



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?



\* Like 4+ hours? I work in the late afternoons through evening so I’m home more than not. 



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  



\* I could probably do an hour or so. No dog parks. Planning on doing lots of walks and play time indoor and outdoor. Maybe an easy hike here and there.



9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?



\* I’m fine with brushing everyday. I’d rather not get a breed that requires full haircuts. I don’t really want to take on that additional cost of paying a groomer if I can avoid it. I don’t know how good I would be at doing that myself lol. I’m totally fine with regular baths and brushing, trimming nails, etc.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*



10)	What size dog are you looking for?



\* Small. Think purse dog lol.



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



\* A minimal to moderate amount of shedding is fine. I already have a cat so I’m used to that. I don’t want like husky level shedding though lol. I’m okay with reasonable barking like barking at the door. I’d prefer they not be barking constantly for no reason. Minimal slobber, please.



12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



\* It would be nice to be able to but it’s not a big deal for me. I'm fine with using a long line instead.



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



\* Very snuggly!!!



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?



\* Eager to please



15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  



\* I don’t really mind if they bark when someone knocks or approaches the house. I want them to be friendly with people. They don’t have to be best friends with everyone but I want them to be very okay with people.



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?



\* They don’t need to love playing with other dogs but they need to be neutral around them. I’m definitely trying to avoid aggression of any kind.



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



\* Aggression towards people and my cat are big ones for me.



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



\* There is almost always someone home, so not very often at all. At the most, 4-5 hours.



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 



\* I live with family who wouldn’t care too much as long as the dog wasn’t large or super disruptive. I would be the caretaker of the dog but my mom would be happy to help with potty breaks and stuff if I was out and needed her to. She could also pet sit if I was gone overnight but I would prefer to just bring the dog with me.



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



\* I have a young adult cat. She is curious and playful.



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



\* No kids in the house right now but I hope to have kids in the next 10ish years? I know that’s a bit of a range lol. So the dog would likely be well into adulthood by then. I do want it to be okay with kids. I know small dogs are more delicate so I would be careful to make sure kids were gentle with her.



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?



\* N/A



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?



\* I live in the US south. No bans that I am aware of.



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?



\* (Farenheit) summer is in the high 70s to 80s and winter is low 50s down to 40s.



\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*



25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.



\* I’m sorry for the long answers lol. I’m definitely overthinking and stressing about this, but I just want to be careful to make the best choice that I can. Thank you for reading my yapping! lol

dogs,How do you get over grief?,"Hello everyone! How do you get over grief over your dog, especially when he hasn't died yet?
I have my dog Pufi, who should have been 13 on the 1st of December, and I am 25 years old, so it's my childhood dog. He has a very large prostate cancer (i mean very large from the x-ray, it cannot be seen otherwhise) and a little something on his brain.
For the last week, his health has been declining rapidly, he is very tired all the time, cannot stand for more than a few minutes and we went to the vet to see what's happening, where the doctors found the prostate cancer and a very severe anemia. They hospitalised him daily from 10:00 to 18:00 to have some transfusions made but he is not getting better and i have been advised that it is time for the injection.
I'm crying non stop, i cannot comprehend him dying, he is my best friend, my angel, my sweet little heart, i cannot accept he is leaving me. Don't get me wrong, i will do the injection for the sake of him this weekend so he doesnt suffer anymore, but i cannot believe this is happening to this poor little baby.
If my state is like this now, before him dying, i dont want to know how it will be after him passing away.

So please, how did you people get over the grief, or at least this big griefing stage, without forgetting your little angel? I cannot see myself looking at his urn with his little picture on top of it and not cry 24/7 missing him. I have 2 more dogs whom i love the most aswell and i want to be hard for them too, hoping they dont get the same grief as me.


EDIT: I will leave here a small video with photos of Pufi and his brother and sister for anyone interested.

dogs,"[Breeds] Research all blending together, would love breed recommendations","**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* It will be my first dog but not my partner’s. I have experience living with and helping train a husky puppy, but she was not my dog.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Slight preference towards working with a reputable breeder as we have a cat and I would like to instill good boundaries from puppyhood. I also want to ensure I know the background and breed of the dog (ie no terriers of any kind) due to prey drive concerns.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* An intelligent dog with interest in hiking, learning tricks, and agility, who would be predisposed to live well with a cat with proper training. I would also like a dog who is comfortable with traveling or with occasionally being watched or boarded for trips they could not attend. I work from home and would be home with the dog at most times.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I am interested in herding dogs due to their intelligence and demeanor, but I would want to ensure a dog would be a good fit before taking on a responsibility and worry that some herding dogs would not do well with pet sitting or boarding.

I have also considered retrievers as from my research they seem to be fairly adaptable, confident, and good with cats.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I would like to train the dog to have good recall, as I live near an off leash hiking trail. I would also like to continuously train tricks for bonding and mental stimulation.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I would love to try agility even without needing to compete. I don’t have any experience in this but would like to work with a local training facility to learn. I would be interested in obedience competitions as well.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* This is flexible as I work remotely, but I want to ensure I do not take on too much responsibility in case I ever needed to work in the office. If I were to work in an office, I would likely be home and awake for 6-7 hours a day and could probably devote 1-2 of those to exercise/training specifically.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours a day. This would include hiking on an off-leash dog trail and walking in a neighborhood. I do also have access to a dog park and I would be interested in participating with a local agility gym.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am open to doing some grooming at home, but would take a dog with more needs (like a rough collie or other dog with a long coat) regularly to a groomer.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* I would prefer a medium to large size dog, but my priority is finding the right fit with the cat and temperament.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I am used to handling extensive shedding. I prefer less barking and slobber if possible for harmony with the cat. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in between.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please for recall training. I loved my time living with a husky but I know owning one is not a good choice for off leash hiking and living with a cat.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I would prefer a confident dog who is comfortable with all of the things. I feel confident working on general reactivity but would not like a dog that is predisposed to greet strangers with aggression, particularly if I ever wanted to use a dog walker or dog boarding facility. I am not concerned about some barking to alert but would prefer not to try to work against a dog’s instincts to constantly keep them quiet.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I would work with a trainer if this were the case. Because I have a cat, I would prefer to adopt a puppy and work from an early age on socialization. I would prefer a dog that is not predisposed to fighting other animals.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Fighting or attacking other animals.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* On a typical day, no more than 2 hours. I work from home and will be with the dog at all times other than running a quick errand.
On the weekend after the dog is an adult, this timeframe could be longer depending on the dog’s needs, but I would prefer that they could be left alone occasionally for 6-8 hours if we ever wanted to take a day trip or had a lot of errands to run.

I would also like a dog who is confident and adaptable enough to occasionally be pet sat by family/friends/or a professional or be boarded so we have the option to occasionally take a vacation that isn’t dog friendly.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My partner will be home in the mornings and evenings and will help with both of these routines and dog walking, as well as training. My partner prefers large dogs.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a 7 year old cat. She has interacted well with a husky, border collie, and a Great Pyrenees. She did not get along with a doodle who played very aggressively with other dogs and her.

No other pets are currently planned.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* ANSWER

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We rent currently and cannot have many large breeds and breeds with high prey drives, including huskies, malamutes, akitas, pitbulls and other bully breeds, malinois, and German shepherds.

We are not given a complete list or weight limit in the lease and would confirm with the landlord before proceeding.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA, no breed bans where I live.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Winter: snowy winters, 30 degrees Fahrenheit
Summer: hot dry summers, 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit

dogs,"Puppy blues, specifically potty training ","So I have a lovely, sweet as anything, 8 month old Black Lab/Great Dane mix, foster failed her about a month ago. She was a farm dog before that, and potty training has been...trying. After her initial few days settling in we started in on establishing a routine, effusive praise and treats when she was peeing outside, setting up a doorbell for her to associate with pee time, and I think we were 90% there (with peeing anyway, poop was about 50-50). She was asking to go out reliably, had a designated pee spot in the backyard, accidents inside were totally understandable for a puppy but trending downward.

We had one day of heavy rain where she was too scared to go outside at all, and it's all gone back to zero. I understand potty training is a series of progression and regression, but she's absolutely refusing to eliminate outside at all; not on walks, not in the yard, not when our other dogs go. This morning I was cleaning up her poop in the hallway which woke me up, so I let her out...and while I was cleaning she snuck up behind me and peed on the floor. When I finished doing that and took everything outside, she pooped inside again. It's baffling, and frustrating, and I can't stop feeling like I'm failing her somehow.

We've tried taking her out at thirty minute intervals, giving her baths to get her used to water (which is odd because she loves water and played in the rain before), like I said the training was going well, I've tried timing her from drinking water to peeing and scheduling going outside around that... I'm just out of ideas, and 6-10 accidents inside a day isn't sustainable and I'm sure causing actual issues in her development. The group we adopted her from has a trainer, and when I asked her, she just shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't know either.

Any ideas are greatly appreciated, she's extremely sensitive and become a bonded pair with my other youngest dog (2 ish year old Staffy).",1731506792.0

dogs,"What breed would suit me best? Lovable, friendly, fetch/play, a little hiking? ","1)    Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, I grew up with an English Cocker Spaniel (RIP <3 the best!), and a Chihuahua who’s now 17 yrs old, still kicking it at my dads. 

2)    Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder].

I'd prefer to rescue just due to how I morally feel, but I would love to have a puppy from a breeder, I don’t think I’m home enough for a puppy though. 

3)    Describe your ideal dog.

Loving, wants to snuggle and be pet/loved. Enjoys playing fetch & gets along with strangers (my friends/family/maybe people at a dog park). Potentially also hiking with them! Nothing crazy but max ~10 miles, maybe an overnight if they like it. 

4)    What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Beagle, Lab, Cocker Spaniel, Irish Setter, Samoyed, Redbone Coonhound. They all seem like friendly dogs that enjoy your affection and strangers. Not agressive, not too big. 

5)    What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Simple stuff, sit, lay down, fetch, nothing crazy. Listen to me and don’t run off into the woods. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Not particularly but I'm not against it. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1-2 hours, more on weekends.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

~1 hour a day of exercise. I'd love to have a dog that enjoys playing fetch and possibly playing with other dogs. I don't have a dog park in mind but I would be open to using one.

9)    How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Fine with anything. My floppy eared cocker spaniel definitly started having ear problems as he got older but I'm not sure that was avoidable.

**Personal Preferences**

10)   What size dog are you looking for?

I would like a slightly larger dog than my ~25lb cocker spaniel, maybe 40-50lbs. But I'm open to any recommendations 25-75lbs.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Fine with it all.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Would really like it, but I don't live in the woods so it's not super important. I would like to be able to go to the school field by my house without the dog running off into the woods for a squirrel though. If I could take the dog hiking it would probably be leashed most of the time anyway.

I am ISO a solid recommendation for a tug toy that I can attach to a spring pole that does not involve rope.

I tried a durable plush attached to a rope that I thought would work, but my AmStaff mix tore it apart in 10 seconds. 😅 They are also not a fan of nylon, so I'm kind of at a loss as to what to go with. Any advice would be appreciated!! ",1731369433.0

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Describe your ideal dog.

* Small, friendly, easily trainable, good with cats, low grooming needs, and doesn't bark a lot

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Pomeranians, toy-sized Mini Aussie, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic tricks

Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I brush my cats every two weeks or so and would do the same for my dog. I can also trim nails. I don't want to pay a professional.

**Personal Preferences**

What size dog are you looking for?

* Toy-sized

How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Plenty of shedding, not much barking or slobber. I'm not allowed to have more pets on my lease so barking would be an issue in that regard. My landlord is offsite and didn't notice that I had an extra cat for six months though even though he'd sit in my window, so the chances of this being an issue are very slim.

How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important as I don't have an unfenced area

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please

* No

Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression towards cats -- I'd have to rehome in this case

**Lifestyle**

How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 10 hours a day on weekdays, 0 hours typically on weekends. I work from 7 am to around 5 pm on average. I could cut it down to 9 hours sometimes. There's no way I could go home midday.

What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Two cats

Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent. Dogs have to be under 50 lbs. I'm also not permitted to have another dog on my lease since I already have two cats, but as I said the landlord lives across the city and this is very unlikely to be an issue as long as the dog doesn't bark and annoy my neighbors.

What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA and no

What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* 90s in the summer, 40s in the winter

**Additional Information and Questions**

Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I could potentially leave my dog with my parents (they live right next to my job) during work. They have a fenced yard and a very friendly Aussie, and my mom's a former vet tech so she's great with dogs. I'd prefer a dog who'd be okay with being alone for 10+ hours though. I don't mind training them to use a pad. I'm also very used to having cats and I've always been a cat person (plus I know they fit my lifestyle better), but I like the idea of having a dog. I never go hiking or go on walks or anything and I think a dog would push me to do more of that.

dogs,Has Hart & Hart’s Behavioral Matrix in “The Perfect Puppy” been replicated or extended?,"I came across this book a long time ago, and I found it very useful and interesting. Two vets developed a matrix of 13 behavioral characteristics (“excitability”, “general activity”, “snapping at children”, etc.) and asked 96 experts to score 56 breeds for each characteristic.

I found the book extremely useful and I looked for an updated edition, and I did not find one.

The book was published in 1985, which means the research is probably 40 years old that this point.

Has anyone published a similar book - maybe expanding the number of breeds covered?

Hart & Hart published what looks to be a veterinary medical student textbook of the sane title that has been updated more recently, I am wondering about a book for the general public.",1731360629.0
dogs,What dog breed would fit my lifestyle best?,"    *Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * First time I will be the primary one responsible for the dog, my family had a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (Toller), got him when I was 2 and he passed away when I was 14. RIP Bourbon you were the best. A family member was very involved with dogsitting and dog training, so I grew up with that too.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * I'm not 100% decided on this, I'm not opposed to rescues but I think for my first dog it's probably wiser to go through a breeder, also as the adult size is fairly important.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * Four-legged best friend that goes everywhere, is up for anything I am. Cuddly and loyal. Friendly to other people at least to some degree. Well trained. Not anxious or agressive. Everything from cuddling on my lap to hiking and boating (dog does not have to enjoy swimming, though.) Not overly afraid of things. Let's be honest, it will probably be wearing cute sweaters in the winter.
    I'm not really sure how to explain my ideal dog but hopefully you get the idea.
    Small, cute, cuddly, big personality, travel and adventure buddy.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * I liked the Toller I grew up with. Have always liked herding dogs, especially border collies and australian shepherds. I like toy australian shepherds aside from the ethical issues of breeding them. Definitely not getting a big dog, A herding dog probably isn't right for me at the moment I need more of a companion. maybe when I'm older a herding dog will join the family. Currently considering a Papillon?
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Aside from obedience, and tricks for fun-
    I'm a small plane pilot, I would like it to get used to flying with me. Also intend to do a lot of traveling and outdoor adventures. 
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * No.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * Whatever is necessary. I have a fairly flexible schedule, and would like my dog to be well-trained, both with obedience and fun things as well. 
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * No dog park. I am a fairly active person, I walk about two miles around my neighborhood most mornings, enjoy hikes from time to time, go backpacking/camping occasionally, etc. I'm open to a combination of the dog exercising with me, and carrying the dog if/when necessary on longer excursions.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * Brushing is not an issue, I already have to brush my cats quite a bit. Don't mind the occasional trim, but I don't really want a dog that requires full haircuts. Cleaning ears, trimming nails, brushing teeth, anything else I may be forgetting at the moment, not a big deal. I bathe dogs for extended family every once in a while, would not mind doing it on a regular basis. Honestly kind of enjoy it, especially if the dog isn't overly terrified.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Small. Under 20 pounds. I travel a decent amount to visit family, and for fun. I would like to bring the dog with me, definitely in-cabin, fees/complications aren't a huge issue.
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * Minimal-moderate shedding is fine. Barking doesn't bother me, although I will spend some time training to avoid the dog bothering others. Would prefer to keep the slobber to a minimum if at all possible.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * No preference. Would like to off-leash train them if possible but it's not a deal breaker.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Snuggly, but they don't HAVE to be in my space 24/7 if they don't want to.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * More on the side of eager-to-please, but I can work through a bit of stubbornness.
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * Barking is fine, it doesn't bother me in small dogs especially, but again would aim for training them to stop on command. Not agressive, not overly shy, friendly enough at least. 
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * Would prefer not. Can deal with it but the goal would definitely be to avoid that through breed and training.

    * I'm not entirely sure on this one. Ideally I would bring the dog everywhere, currently my lifestyle would allow it, but I don't want to be entirely unable to leave them alone for a few hours on occasion when necessary. Definitely will crate-train.
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * Currently living with my parents, the dog would be my responsability but they would be somewhat of a safety net in case of sudden large fees, or if I needed a dogsitter.
     My mother does not want a large slobbery dog, my dad does not want a chihuahua. Those are their preferences as far as I know, lol.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * Two cats, fairly chill unless they're playing. They would be apprehensive at first but I think would make friends with a dog, as they did with Bourbon (previous dog.)
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * A 4 year old in the household (5 by the time I would get a dog), but it would be under direct supervision at all times and because of the cats he knows to be very gentle. 
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * No.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * None that would apply to the breeds I want. (NO Brachycephalic breeds, please, due to travel by air.)
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * -FAHRENHEIT- Average of 60-70, high of 85 (maybe). Average of 20-30, low of maybe 5-10 during the day like one or two days a year. Willing to purchase dog sweaters LOL. 
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    * I am (low-support needs) autistic, and have some anxiety issues. While not an official emotional support animal or anything, it will be my companion while I navigate the transition to adulthood, and will ideally be a comfort when people are too overwhelming. 
    It will be my adventure buddy, from flying to backpacking, etc.
    
    I have not owned a dog myself before, but I have been around them a lot, I'm doing my research, and I know the challenges. I think the project of training a dog would be good for me, and overall a dog is a good level of responsablility to get used to.
     Sorry if I'm not making sense. Not sure exactly when I'll move out, but not for a year or two at least, will most likely stay in the same town. 
    Not going away to college. I intend to do everything in my power to pay for and care for the dog myself but my family is willing to help out if necessary.
     
    I'm trying to be realistic, I know it can't go with me -everywhere- but it will not likely spend a ton of time on it's own.
    
    Thank you everyone!

dogs,Which dog would be suitable for me?,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be my first dog, but I have had contact with a lot of dogs through my family and friends. My girlfriend's family owns a dog but she does not have much experience in training a dog.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* A dog that loves going on outdoor adventures, playing outside and that is capable to go on long hikes and walks in the mountains. But doesn't mind lazy days (apart from the daily walks of course). The dog should be trainable and smart but not require constant attention or hours of excercise each day. It should also be ""cuddly"" and family friendly (I have young nieces but no kids myself). I am struggling with mental health so it should be suited as a ""therapy dog"" and I am willing to committ to training the dog. Chill about other animals outside such as cats or cows as we live in a rural area with a lot of farmland.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I don't have a specific preference. I don't like tiny dogs or dogs with short legs and that seem to be ""chubby"".

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Probably about 60 minutes of excercise each day. We work full time so it is hard to find time every day for more than that. We will committ more time to in on weekends. No dog parks but plenty of open space, farmlands, forests, etc.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Willing to do this myself. Should not shed too much but not a big issue. No preference.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Preferably smaller than a labrador. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can tolerate some shedding and barking. I would like to avoid slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* A snuggly dog but that does not require constant attention.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More eager to please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* We will make sure someone stays with the dog but there might be a few days a week when the dog will be left alone for a few hours.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My girlfriend will take care of the dog with me.

* Switzerland. Some ""violent"" and difficult breeds are banned.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I enjoy doing outdoor activities and I live in the mountains. While I try to be active some days or weekends won't be as active as I would like them to be. So there will be days and weekends with not much happening. I would try to involve the dog as much as possible but with a full time job and a full schedule it is just not always possible.

dogs,Breed Recommendation ,"1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, I’ve had two dogs as an adult. I had a French bulldog from 1-8 who came into my home due to my friend being given him and her being in a situation she had to move from her pet friendly home. A few years later, I had a mix(GSD, collie and Mastiff and some other breeds I’m forgetting)for a few years. Unfortunately my dad was dog sitting my dog and he got out of his yard and got hit by a car. I had them both crate trained and with good recall. I also grew up around my sister training dogs to be able to go to old folks homes and such as emotional support dogs.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I personally would be fine with rescue but my wife is a bit hesitant as this would be her first dog as an adult and not sure she’s ready for the potential of a dog with special needs or trust issues etc that can come with a rescue. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Will come with us on hikes, walks, outdoor adventures, camping and all that which we do a good bit of but still can hang out at home when we are on down time. Medium sized at least and lovable. Don’t need a serious or intense dog like say a Shiba or Belgian(even tho I love them both as breeds).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

A good ol lab, or golden quite often. I love pretty well all dogs but I am always drawn to their overall demeanours. I do love frenchies still after my last one passed away but they just aren’t great for keeping up in a consistent outdoors setting. Also love a GSD, Mastiffs of various forms and mutts. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Just be a normal average dog. Good recall, fetch, normal basic commands, crate trained. Sure some fun tricks are great but it’s not something I NEED them to do.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

As much as I can. My wife and I often work different shifts so we both would likely get upwards of 5-6 hours a day with the dog. Unless we both quit our jobs which seems like the only correct answer.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

2 hours or so, likely would be a bit more but I live near a very big park so often we go out to just go for a long walk around. Dog parks yes if the dog likes them. Just depends.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Fine with brushing regularly, cleaning ears, trimming nails. If for some reason the dog didn’t like having some of the more jarring things done like nails or what have you, I don’t mind paying someone. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

A barky or mouthy dog wouldn’t be ideal… obviously every dog has their noises and barks sometimes but a husky would be out. As for slobber and shedding, I don’t mind it, while less is better in the shedding department, it’s an accepted thing.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not really.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please and hang out 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Yes to greeting them. I don’t want people to be nervous around my dog because of how it reacts to people knocking on the door.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I personally don’t mind it but I don’t think my wife would be good with handling that as much.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Nothing really else. I’m aware any dog can adopt certain personality traits and it is what it is. Obviously try my hardest to keep it socialized to both humans and other animals but yeah. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Regularly for 6ish hours. I can bring dog to work however at this time so likely less but if I wasn’t able to, it would be that much. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Similar to mine but just a bit more hesitant with dogs having their issues prior and not it being much harder to deal with later in life(a rescue versus a young trainable pup).

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Rent yes, but no restrictions.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Vancouver Canada.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Warm and humid and sunny in the summer, wet and rainy and mild in the winter. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Very open to other breeds not mentioned prior in the other answers as long as they are medium sized or larger. I’ve gotten along with every dog I’ve had the pleasure of meeting, dog sitting or spending time with and appreciate all shapes and sizes.

dogs,Mom’s dog pooped on the porch. (vent),"
My mom for some reason doesn’t feel the need to enforce where her dog poops. I personally think it’s disgusting to find little turds on the pool deck and driveway. Oh and I love getting yelled at by her neighbor because her dog pooped in their yard. I’ve tried so hard over the last year to train it out of her. I went out of town for the weekend and came back to poo everywhere, including the neighbors yard.

This morning I let her out and she immediately tries to poop on the front porch. I say, “no lily go in the grass.” And she goes straight to the neighbors yard. 🤦‍♂️ I ran over to corral her into our yard, no worries about stepping on 💩 in our yard! lol But she runs to the driveway where she let one go out the bombbay door. I yell “no lily!” which scares her and she runs back to the porch to end the bombing sortee.

My dog!? Different story. He happily trots to the side yard to do his business and make sure there aren’t any squirrels in the yard.

dogs,Recommending [Breeds] for my mom and her partner. ,"1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

No, my mother has had dogs her/our whole life and has both done training herself as well as through classes with a trainer. Her partner has also had dogs throughout his life and his sister is a cocker spaniel breeder in the UK. 


2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

They have welcomed home pups both ways in the past and are open to either option. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Medium to large breeds 
Generally friendly with people, other dogs, and animals
Happy to be out and active (they love the water—swimming, boating, they scuba dive, they bike, and they always love a walk) but also happy to laze at home
Eager to learn and follow through
They are happy to put in work training but do not want to do any kind of intense/militant obedience/task training

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

They like golden retrievers and Bernese, but are aware they’re “heartbreak breeds”—our family grew up with goldens and we’ve known many Bernese throughout our life as well. They also like Newfies and Akbash. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic manners and every day things (sit, stay, recall, leave it, etc)

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No sport or work, just daily activities with them. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Her partner will be retired so he will be with the pup all day, and she will be working on location some days and at home some days, so they will be wanting to spend as much time as possible with the pup. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

At least a couple hours every day, but not sure about dog parks. They want to do trails and hiking, where they will still meet other dogs, in addition to regular walks. They also love the water so will be at the beaches and lakes regularly. Maybe cycling, as well. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Yes to both, she loved brushing our dogs but also took them to the groomers. Regular brushing is no problem. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium-large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding is not a problem. Controlled barking is ok but does not want a breed that will be wanting to bark 24/7. Slobber, minimal though will be in a house with hardwood floors so clean up isn’t an issue. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It would be ideal to be able to have the pup off leash in off-leash/leash-optional areas. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly, or equally snuggly and happy to have its own space. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Definitely would like the pup to alert to knocking or someone/something in the yard but not excessive. Friendly to strangers or visitors. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

If the pup ends up being reactive or aggressive of course they’d manage it. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

High anxiety/destructive. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not long as her partner will be retired and she will be home often as well. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

It will be just my mother and her partner and they will be caring for the dog quite equally. Their preferences are quite similar. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Eventually planning on a second dog, but will obviously be starting with one. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No, it would just be if they were to encounter children while out and about.

We have a good group of people but lately she’s been stealing the toys that other dogs bring to the park. One person for example likes to play fetch with their dog, and occasionally my dog takes the ball and just runs. She likes the chase game I assume but today the owner was not happy about it. I was trying so hard to get her to just come to me so I can get the ball but she was playing keep away. Eventually I stormed at her and was able to scare her or tire her out more? Idk but she eventually just paused and gave me the ball?

What do I do? Obviously no more park time until she learns to come to me when she has something I want, but how do I go about this? She’s good at fetch when we are alone, shes good when there is just one other dog and they take turns with keep away.

dogs,"first-time dog owner: should I get a dog, and which breed should I get","**Introduction**

Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I have some experience dog-sitting for a friend, but he was a very very well behaved, older golden retriever so I wouldn't consider myself experienced in handling dogs, much less a puppy. 

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I would prefer going through a reputable breeder, but those are quite hard to find in my country (Singapore) so I've been considering importing from a reputable breeder overseas. I'd like to consider adoption, but from what I understand adopted dogs tend to have some trauma from being abandoned/other behavioural problems and I'm not sure if I'm equipped to handle that. 

Describe your ideal dog.

I think the most important trait is quietness- I know that puppies are work, and need to be trained, but I live in an apartment and would like to minimise disturbances to my neighbours as much as possible! I'm okay with some yapping in response to stimuli, but breeds on super high alert (poms, chihuahuas) would be a straight no. 

I usually go on 20-60 min runs everyday, so I think that suits most of the smaller breeds' activity levels? Not sure if that narrows it down a lot except for the exclusion of terriers and shelties. 

I'm don't have much of a preference for grooming needs, barring breeds that need daily grooming- weekly/biweekly is fine. 

Personality and temperament wise- a dog that's happy to cuddle on the couch, but also wants to play! Eager to please personalities would be a bonus as they'd be easier to train (from what I've heard), which would make things easier for me. 

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I did the AKC quiz, and I've narrowed it down to a few: coton de tulear, Japanese chin, Japanese spitz, and cavalier king charles, and golden retrievers (unfortunately they don't fit the housing regulations of my apartment so I can't actually own one, but a smaller breed with a similar temperament would be wonderful)

generally, these 4 breeds (excluding the golden) tend to be less barky, and can be both couch potatoes and affectionate + don't need too much exercise, something like 45-60 min walks should suffice. do let me know if I'm misinformed though! 

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

basic obedience, pee pad training, maybe some simple tricks! more concerned over separation anxiety and being friendly with strangers though as I don't want my neighbours to have to deal with an aggressive dog

Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Nope

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

2-3 hours a day on weekdays but definitely something like 4-5 hours on weekends, excluding walks and feeding him

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

20-60 min walks in the nearby park. there is a nearby dog park, but I've heard that some of the owners who go don't properly vaccinate and train their dogs so I'm not sure if that's the best way to socialise a new puppy/dog. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I'm okay with basic grooming once/2-3 times a week (brushing, cleaning ears, trimming nails etc) at home, but I don't trust myself to cut my own hair so I definitely don't think I should be cutting my dog's fur either. We'd rather pay a professional to do that regularly so we don't accidentally injure the dog.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

definitely medium-small/toy due to our apartment restrictions (no specific weight restrictions, but there is a list of approved breeds)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

shedding is fine, but minimal slobbering as my dad is a bit of a clean freak. the fur isn't an issue as a have a robot cleaner, but he's specifically requested a slobber free dog LMAO. minimal barking too as mentioned above (some barking is fine, but not excessively yappy)

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

not very important? we don't have a balcony or garden, so the dog would have to be on leash in public whenever it's being walked

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

i would LOVE a snuggly dog but I'm also quite partial to cats for their independence so I'm okay with either! 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

eager to please definitely- I don't have experience training a dog, so getting a stubborn dog would definitely be challenging

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

calm, composed, hopefully don't anxious! it'd be best if he was friendly to strangers, but that's not super important as long as he's calm and doesn't get aggressive. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

preferably not- I don't think we're equipped to do that? but we don't have other pets or young children at home so I don't think that would be much of an issue as we don't live in an area with many dogs anyways

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

mostly just barking, aggression, and slobber

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I'm still in university, so this would be a family dog! My parents are okay with providing financial support for its needs, but there will probably be 1-2 days a week where the dog will have to be home alone for at least 4-5, sometimes 6-8 hours (my parents have a hybrid work schedule but have to be in office sometimes, and I'm in school 2-3 days a week, but sometimes our schedules don't line up). Ideally the dog would have to be okay with dealing with separation anxiety (I know this requires training too, but I think some breeds are clingier than others?). As a separate question- knowing that the dog has to be alone sometimes, should I even be getting a dog? I'm worried about the quality of dog walkers/sitters in my area as there has been a spate of unpleasant cases recently, and I don't want to run that risk. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

I'd be the one walking and grooming the dog, but it'll be a family dog and my parents are paying for the expenses. no one in the family has any allergies so that shouldn't be an issue

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

nope

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

nope

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

no, we own. the breed restrictions are here: [https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/keeping-pets](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/keeping-pets) (generally small-medium dogs)

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

NA, just the above.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

we live near the equator, so it's usually either really sunny (29-32 degrees  in the day) or very rainy (thunderstorms) but when it rains, usually a few times a week, it's quite cooling (27 degrees ish)

dogs,Finding the right veterinarian practice,"Hi everyone, this is more of a question but has anyone had a hard time finding the right veterinarian practice for your dog?
I’m a first-time dog owner. He’s 1yr. We’ve been going to a practice that my parents used to go to for this entire time, but the doctor we have had is a little bit weird and over the top. The last time we felt he tried to scare us into thinking something may be wrong with our dog and caused unnecessary worry. However, as far as treatment and his surgery being neutered, we have really had a good experience overall with that.
I went to try a couple of different practices in my area. I have all of his vet records, and I went to a different vet today but also did not feel it was the right fit, especially reading some of the recent reviews. 
There is another practice I would like to try when he gets his next set of shots in a few months, but I feel a little bit self-conscious about trying out different vets. Is this normal to feel this way? Do vets not like when you do this? ",1731000564.0

dogs,New rescue- does it get easier??,"Some of you might remember my post last week asking for opinions on adopting older dog.

Well, I brought the dog home to foster-to-adopt while he finishes heartworm treatment.  He is a beautiful, sweet golden retriever mix who just wants to be loved.  It felt like all the signs were there and the timing just fell into place. 

Unfortunately, my little poodle mix seems to have missed that memo.  I think I underestimated (or maybe just tried to forget) how fear reactive he can be.  The shelter staff warned me that it could take several weeks of working with them.  It’s only day 2 and I’ve seen some TINY signs of progress.  We’ve reached the point of calmly coexisting in separate rooms, and the poodle seems to be a tiny bit braver about approaching the gate.  But we have miles to go.  I ventured into the reactive dogs sub, and now I’m wondering if he’ll ever really adjust.  There’s a LOT I could’ve been working on with him before bringing another dog into the home.

Like I said, it’s day 2 and I’m willing to keep working.  I just have this sinking feeling that I’m not giving either dog what they really need from me.  They both want my attention all the time, but I can’t be in 2 places at once.  I feel bad for making the poodle scared in his own home, I feel bad that I can’t give my undivided attention to helping the new dog get settled in.  And I hate the thought of being the second foster-to-adopt home to return this amazing boy to the animal shelter.  I don’t want to give up too early but I also want to do right by both dogs.

I‘m just exhausted.  Exhausted from trying to keep both dogs happy and loved, exhausted from being woken up at 4 AM by a giant goober who wants to wrestle and shred my blankets, and exhausted from trying to figure all this out.  I knew it would take work, but I didn’t fully realize just how MUCH work.

dogs,Please give a newbie some advice on [breeds] that work well for a young family with kids and cats ,"\*\*Introduction\*\*



1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?



\* Essentially yes. Both my wife and I (both 30 years old) had dogs in the family growing up, but haven’t owned one ourselves. We both know very little about dogs and have never considered ourselves dog people, but are now seriously considering it, if we can find a breed that fits with our family well.



2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?



\* Reputable breeder.



3)	Describe your ideal dog.



\* The ideal dog would be great with kids (we have a 2yo, a 4yo, and a 6yo who is very eager to be the “primary caregiver”, something we hope she’ll grow into), and would be totally comfortable with a loud, boisterous house with lots of kids coming and going. We are also a foster family, so we have new kids staying with us for varying periods of time essentially all the time. If nothing else, the dog has to be great with kids and adaptable given our family situation. Beyond that, the ideal dog would be playful, as between me and my wife and the kids there will be no shortage of people around to play with the dog. Ideally the dog will not be insanely messy or gross, but I get that dogs are dogs. The dog will ideally not have a ton of separation anxiety since we do all have things going on with work, church, social stuff, etc. We’re home a lot, but the dog will have to be okay in the backyard for several hours at least three-four times per week.



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



\* I’m wide open here. The only thing is I don’t want a cat-sized dog. We already have two cats and I don’t want a third. Medium sized at smallest frankly. Beyond that, I’m all ears. I suppose I’m hesitant about border collies, only because that’s the type of dog we had several of growing up, and they were consistently not great with kids from my personal experience.



5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?



\* Nothing crazy. Essentially all the training would be just behavioral stuff or cute little “play dead, shake, roll over” type things.



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?



\* No



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?



\* I see no reason why we wouldn’t have at least an hour of dedicated time for training, plus a ton of unstructured time where the dog is just around for whatever is happening.



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  



\* We live in a great neighborhood for walking and do that a lot as is, and obviously the dog will be part of that. I bet a two mile walk every other day is reasonable.



9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?



\* I don’t know that I’m willing to pay a professional, and I don’t really want to do much. I know some will be required and that’s fine, but definitely not looking for a high maintenance dog.



\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*



10)	What size dog are you looking for?



\* medium-large. 



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



\* Shedding - can handle some but not much. Barking - I mean I’d rather it not bark all night but dogs bark and that’s a reality I’m fine with. Slobber — This I am least tolerant of. As little as possible ideally.





12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



\* This isn’t insanely important as we don’t envision ourselves becoming “take the dog everywhere” people.



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



\* For me and my wife — personal space. For our kids - snuggly as possible.



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?



\* I guess I don’t know. Probably middle of the road. We already have cats like I said, so some people pleasing wouldn’t hurt.



15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  



\* Like I said with the fostering thing, this dog would have to be totally great with new faces all the time. I’m not looking for a watchdog.



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?



\* This will ideally almost never be a problem. Like I said, we’re not dog park people and don’t even live close to one, and I don’t envision us taking the dog around publicly much.



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



\* I don’t think so.



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



\* We’re at the house a lot as our kids are homeschooled, but there are definitely days where we’re out and about. The dog will have to be okay outside in the back yard (decent sized and fenced in) for at least a few hours on regular basis.



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 



\* This will start being me and my wife teaching our oldest daughter to care for the dog, transitioning at some point to her being primary. Everybody is on board and excited for a dog though.



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



\* We have two cats, one male and one female. They’re both fairly young (2yo and not quite a year old) and are absolutely wonderful with kids. They’re almost like dogs in their temperament, as many people have pointed out.



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



\* Nearly every waking second this dog will be around kids.



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?



\* N/A



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?



\* East Texas. N/A



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?



\* Typical summer is very hot. High of 105F not uncommon. Typical winter pretty moderate. Average low in January probably like 38F and high like 55F.



\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*



25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.



As I’m typing this I feel like I’ve got a pretty narrow window of what would work with our fairly crazy house as is. Hopefully there’s a breed out there that would fit into our box. We’d need the dog to be exactly what we want it to be in many respects, but for the right dog our house would be loving and fun as hell, haha. 



26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

dogs,WIBTAH for taking my dog reactive dog to dog sports?,"I have a dog reactive dog and we have been working on it for about a year now. She’s making progress but has her times where she’s regressed. I would LOVE to put her in dog sports, specifically agility. She loves the agility course when we go to dog parks (at off times and I lock the gate so no one else can enter if they do come) that have it.

dogs,Male or female,"I'm searching for a dog to replace my dearest girl who died five years ago.  We've only had Rottweilers but since we're older now (late 60s), we're thinking a smaller, mixed breed will be better suited for us.  Our issue is what gender should we get? We have friends who have a female who's from the Mexican streets who is a resource guarder, and other friends who have a little female terrier, another who has a female lab and another who has a male poodle.

dogs,An intact dog keeps humping my dog at the park… what should I do?,"When we go to the dog park there is a small young poodle who keeps humping my dog, to the point that it’s almost obsessive and we leave.


This poodle isn’t desexed and in my opinion is poorly socialised.


The owner seems to think it’s funny and takes videos. She thinks it’s just some harmless domination…


My dog is double the size, but he is very sweet, playful, gentle and tends to be submissive. I don’t think he likes it at all.  He runs around initially (like it’s a game) but then he eventually will try to pin down the other dog.


My dog doesn’t seem to want to leave the park, but he rolls onto his back a lot. When this happens I end up pulling the humping dog off my dog so he can have a break. 


I don’t know the etiquette here, and I also don’t know enough about dog behaviour to know what’s really going on. 


My gut says my dog is overwhelmed and that this other dog should be leaving the park… but I just need some advice on dog behaviour before I start confronting people.


Thank you for your time and advice!


Edit: thank you for the replies! We have started going to a different dog park that’s a little further away but seems to have a good crew. If we see this dog again I will calmly mention it to the owner and then keep walking. Very true that we don’t want either dog to get injured! Thanks again for the advice!",1730833960.0

dogs,Is a dog park good enrichment even if the dog doesn't play a ton?,"I have a 1yo foster dog right now who hates walks (scared of the large city nosies), doesn't have 100% recall, but still has a good amount of energy to spend. At a large field in a park, she plays with dogs like crazy, but it's not an official dog park so there aren't always dogs there. I've taken her to 3 different dog parks in the city and she sniffs and interacted with all the dog and runs a *bit* but doesn't go ham playing with them. Is this still an effective way to tire her out?

dogs,[Breeds] Looking for a small family dog suited for city life,"    **Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * This will be my first dog as an adult but I had a golden retriver growing up. 
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * I would prefer a rescue but would go to a reputable breeder for the right match.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * We are looking to get a small breed dog. I am a small lady and I want a dog I can walk by myself without worring about the posibility of the dog being stronger than me. We also live in a city and while we have lots of parks for a dog to run around in I think a smaller breed would be happier. I love going for walks so a dog that likes walking would be great and a dog with a good temperment is a must since we have two cats and a four year old daughter. I don't mind a dog that needs brushing as I already brush our cats and plus there are lots of local pet groomers in fact our vet has a grooming service. I dont want a dog that is too high energy but a cuddle bug would be great.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * My husband likes Corgi since he thinks they are cute and have a pretty good temperment. We have been able to ineract with a lot of corgi's and they do seem friendly and my daughter likes them. However, I do have concerns about a corgi's back since we have stairs in our condo. I am partial to mini poodles from what I have read they have a good personality and the fact they don't shed a lot is a plus. I also think a mini poodle would handle the stairs better. Granted we are usually upstairs so I am not opoosed to carrying a dog down the stairs I already carry my daughter. 
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Again we live in a city so I would want to train the dog some basic commands to ensure they stay by my side while on walks (with a leash but I dont want them to pull). I would also train the dog to play nice with our cats and the dog would be potty trained to only go to the bathroom outside. My husband had a bad experience with dogs where his mother let the dog go to the batrhoom inside on puppy pads and outside of potty training I want to avoid that. I would also teach the dog basic things like to sit and lay down. I am also open to crate training. My dog growing up wasn't crate trained but I want to do whatever is best for the dog.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * No
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * I hope to interact with them all day. I already give my cats tons of cuddles and part of the reason I want a dog is because I want a cuddle buddy. The dog would be part of the family so they'd be with us all the time. We have a dog park near by so I imagine we'd go there a lot to play fetch and let the dog run around andplay with other dogs. 
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * I love walking so I want a dog that can be my walking buddy. We have lots of gorgeous parks near by and my daughter no longer depends on a stroller so I plan to take the dog with us wherever we go. So on weekends this basically means spending the whole day outside. On weekdays I work from home three days a week so on those days we'd have a walk in the morning, then we'd spend my lunch hour outside and then we'd have another walk at night when my daughter goes to bed. On days I am in office the dog would still have a walk in the morning and evening. There is a doggy daycare by my work that I think I would use for the dog on in office days. 
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * I am open to doing regular prushing and trimming nails as I do that for our cats. I remember having to clean our golden's ears when and it honestly wasn't that hard. As for trimming I would leave that to a professional . I'd budget around $100 or so a month for grooming. 
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Small, something that is under 25 pounds
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * I am fine with all three but would probably prefer not a lot of barking as we have neighbors.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * I would not let my dog off-lesh in an unfenced area. It would be too dangerous in the area I live in. Drivers just do not pay much attention. But I would happily let them run around in a fenced in area. 
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Snuggly, I want a cuddle buddy who is also my walking buddy.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * Eager to please
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * I would love a dog that greets vistors. Our cats hide when strangers come over and it stresses me out because I am always worried of finding them in an emergency. So a dog that likes strangers would be wonderful.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * I would not. There are simply too many dogs being walked in the area I live in and I don't think I could handle it. 
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * I would need a dog that can be trained out of being nippy. I dont want the dog to playfully nip at one of the cats and hurt them. 
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * Both my husband and I are homebodies and we only travel once a year for christmas. I work from home most days but on in office days I plan to put the dog in a doggy daycare. For christmas travel my mother (who lives a block away) has already agreed she would watch the dog. My parents have owned many dogs over the years all of which have been very happy and healthy 
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * My husband does not want a dog that relieves itself in the house. His pet growing up was allowed to go to the bathroom on puppy pads and this has given him a bad opinion of dogs. I told him this wasn't normal and the dog would be going to the bathroom outside.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * We have two cats. One is a tabby and the other is some sort of short hair, we found him on the streets so no idea what he is. 
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * Yes, we have a four year old who is turning five soon. We have taught her to be very kind to animals. She knows not to pick them up or pull on them. She is very good with our cats and likes small dogs but is afraid of bigger dogs.
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * We own our condo and do not plan on moving. 
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * Philadelphia, PA and not that I am aware of
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * It is humid in the summar but rarely gets over 100F and in the winter rarely below 30F
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    * Getting a dog I am capable of walking myself is very important so I am very steadfast about a smaller breed. I have seen dogs get away from people because the dog was too big for them and I do not want to risk that. So please keep in mind I am a small 5'1 woman. I would hate to get a dog that is too big and is able to rip away from me and runs off getting lost or wose getting hit by a car.

dogs,Visualizing Embark DNA data?,"Hi,

I have a karyogram from Embark of my dog, but I don't really like the visualization since it doesn't show the actual biological structure of the chromosomes and the colors are more or less random. I know they represent different dog breeds, but the colors themselves don't really matter. Any color could be used to represent any dog breed.

Since Embark lets you download the raw DNA data, I was wondering if anyone could recommend any kind of options for using this data to produce different karyogram visualizations or really any other kind of interested visualizations of the DNA data. 

I don't mind using things that aren't necessarily user friendly as I am fairly technically competent. I just don't know what even exists to try and a cursory google search hasn't turned up much.

dogs,When to drop friends over my dogs..,"Curious what boundaries you all draw with your friends/dogs, and when you would drop a friend over violating those boundaries.

I've previously banned a friend from my house for generally antagonizing one of my dogs (pulling on her tail, patting her relatively hard on the head repeatedly, etc.). She is extremely tolerant and allowed my friend's behavior, but that does not mean she needs to be constantly subjected to it, especially by a full grown adult. I politely asked him to stop; he did not, so he is no longer welcome at my place.

Recently, another friend, whom I've trusted to care for my dogs in the past, came over and riled my dog up so much that she jumped up and accidentally scratched him on the hand. He plays with her a lot, which I don't mind, but now he won't stop bringing up this scratch and acting like somehow my dog is out of control.

I can't decide if this new scenario is enough to ban this friend from seeing my dogs, but I'm leaning towards yes. We literally worked in canine behavior together, so I feel like there's no excuse for him to be blaming this on my dog.",1730741172.0

dogs,"carrying a chew around and trying to hide/bury it, is he having fun?","sorry for the strangely worded title, tough coming up with something concise! We noticed that when we give our 2 y.o. herding breed mix an especially appreciated chew he gets really excited to accept it. Maybe 10% of the time he'll go right to work and chew it up. 

The other 90% of the time he will carry it from place to place in the house looking IMO kind of stressed out, hiding it in a pile of laundry, then behind some books on a shelf, etc, etc, each only for a few seconds and then picks it up again and keeps carrying it around. These times he never chews on it at all, just carries it around seeming to be looking for the right hiding/storage spot. He looks driven, like he's on a mission. 

I can't tell if this is stressful for him, or is he's enjoying this whole activity, or what is going on? He gets lots of other stimulation (stuffed kongs etc) so I can just eliminate giving him this type of chew if it's more upsetting than fun.

I'm planning on adopting a sweet 5-month old puppy this Friday. She is a sweet, confident girl who has been a social butterfly in her foster home. I have a cat and a 10 year old senior pup who's pretty dog-friendly. Another thing to note is that this puppy is blind. Here's the question...

I work Monday-thursday full time and my partner works most of the day on Tuesday-Thursday. On these days we're planning on taking her to my parent's house. My dad and mom are retired and they have a lovely sweet older dog. My mom is a retired dog trainer and they're both excited. 

 My partner and I have about a week off to ensure she settles in, but am not sure when to include a trip to ""grandpa's house"". I don't want to overwhelm her. Would bringing her over 12 days after her adoption date be way too soon? I know the 3-3-3 rule but not sure how to gauge...

Me and my boyfriend are kind of struggling to figure out a solution to keep the puppy away from her food when he's older. My cat does not eat all at once and feeds throughout the day so it's not like we can separate them until they are both finished eating. We are currently trying to feed her on a table but she's having none of that and screams at us because her food is not on the floor. I've been considering putting a ramp up to the table but again, I fear that the dog will just climb up their himself and eat her food anyway. 

Obviously for the first two years while he's training he'll be kenneled or put in a pen while we are away, but when we're home I can't constantly be watching to make sure he doesn't sneak up and eat her food.

The rest of the time she’s using puppy pads. Last night when I was putting all my kids to bed, she was howling for attention and had the zoomies. I think we will get there eventually 🥰

I just adopted a 5 month old mixed breed last night and she’s terrified. She came from a foster home and had 2 siblings with her but they’ve already been adopted. We were told she was very sweet and good with cats, kids, and other dogs. I have 4 boys ages 2-7 so good with kids was a huge thing for us. Plus we have 2 cats. She was very attached to her foster mom and foster dog brother. 

I brought her home last night and she’s so scared. I immediately put her in our bedroom to decompress with a crate, a blanket from her foster home, food and water. She likes cheese so I’ve been using that as a treat. She did eat her food and went potty outside, but she won’t follow me on a leash so I have to carry her outside to go. 

She slept all night in her crate without a peep. It’s morning and I opened her crate up because she needs to go potty but she won’t come out.

10)	What size dog are you looking for?



On the smaller size.



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



Not much I think. x)

None that comes to mind and that's isn't obvious.

I live alone.



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



Nope.



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



Nope.



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?



I rent already, there's no particular restrictions outside of being clean, calm and not destroying stuff.



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?



Paris, France. We have categories of dogs that are loosely enforced.



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?



Summer is probably 30°, winter is probably 0°.

I've always wanted a dog and even if I'm not ready, I want to know what my dream breed is!  
  
1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* Yes, first dog!!  
  
2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* I don't! Whatever is gonna get me a healthier dog I guess  
  
3)Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* My ideal dog is super cuddly, likes to chill and is at least mostly calm. I want a dog that's not gonna bark intensely and bother neighbours every time someone approaches my door. Also, for financial reasons, I'd like it to be a healthy dog!  
  
4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* I've done a lot of googling, and some examples of breeds that interest me (I used [chewy.com](http://chewy.com) to see the dogs that have the traits I like, so I hope their info is good) are the Greyhound, Papillon, Borzoi, Rat Terrier or maybe a Mastiff? or Tibetan Mastiff?. Also, the Shetland Sheepdog is I think like my ideal dog esthetically, but apparently they're super barky so I wouldn't have one.  
  
5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* Whatever I can i'd say? Like I don't necessarily need a super easy to train dog, but I wanna be able to train him still and make him do basic stuff! More trainability is a good bonus, but not a like requirement  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* An hour or two?   
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* I visit the local park daily, which includes a dedicated dog park area. I can commit like1 hour of outdoor activity, combining walks, interactive play, and relaxed time together. While I'm not a runner, I'm an enthusiastic walker and would ensure my dog gets plenty of exercise through both leashed walks and off-leash play at the dog park. Also, I have to say I don't have a car and live in a kinda big city, so I'd rarely have the occasion to bring him in ""real"" nature!

dogs,My soul dog passed today,"My sweet little baby passed away today. I’ve had him since I was 14 and we got to spend a decade together, but it still doesn’t feel like enough time. 

A weird thing that has came up is that I’m afraid I’m going to forget how soft he was. His fur was fine and he was particularly soft for his breed and it was one of my favorite things about him. I feel like i can’t capture the memory of petting him. I have hundreds of pictures and videos, I made paw print memorabilia, I even have his stinky blanket, but I can’t capture his feel. I did order a fur keepsake with his cremation, but I don’t think you can touch it and even if you could, touching would ruin the texture. 

I’ve lived my entire adult life and most of my teenage years with him and he’s been with me through so much. I don’t know what life is like without him. I wish I had more time with him, and it especially hurts because his illness onset and progressed so quickly.

dogs,"Feeling frustrated about what my friends consider ""good dogs""","I have a 4-year-old Siberian Husky who, while not everyone's ideal dog, is the perfect fit for me. Today, I was out with friends and casually mentioned how proud I am of how well-trained he is. My friends, who don't really know him (we live in different areas and meet in the middle), scoffed. I explained that he’s been through advanced obedience training, even earning his Canine Good Citizen (CGC) certification. However, because he's a Husky, he doesn’t listen to just anyone—you have to earn his respect, unlike some breeds that are intrinsically motivated to please humans.

Their response was a sarcastic “So he’s not really trained, then.” I found this frustrating, especially because I see his independence as a feature, not a flaw. To me, training isn’t about erasing a dog’s personality or suppressing their natural instincts just to make them perfectly compliant. I don’t expect my Husky to behave like a Golden Retriever, as they’re wired differently. In fact, I value his independent thinking and how he clearly expresses his boundaries. It’s a trait I respect, even if it might come across as “stubbornness” to others.

While it’s not a huge deal, I find it frustrating that many people, including my friends, define a “good dog” solely as one that’s perfectly obedient, even at the cost of their comfort and natural personality. To me, the goal of training isn’t to make him submissive but to build mutual understanding and respect.

dogs,Dog for the  Future,"I will start off with saying I plan on reaching out to breeders/people with the breeds, but I felt like this was a chance to get more peoples opinions at once.



1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

No, I have owed a sheltie, a husky/border collie mix, and two rough collies. 



2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]

Reputable breeder 



3. Describe your ideal dog.

I want a higher drive dog that is biddable. I would like to continue to compete in rally, fast Cat, and agility. I’ve been training my collies in scent work so I plan on starting to compete next year for that. I would also like to potentially start to do dock diving, and barn hunt as well. I like a medium to long coat that is softer. I tend to love herding breeds. I love my rough collies, but they tend to be a bit lower drive, and I want a dog that can keep up with me more. I like having a dog that I can train how to settle when needed to, but I am decently active between training, playing with dogs, hiking, walking, and competitions. I do not care about barking, my collies are very vocal. And I’ve dog sit dogs that that just scream. The barking or screaming noise has never bothered me. 



4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



I am thinking about a Mudi or a Border Collie. Something about Mudi’s interest me a lot. They overall seem like the entire package. I was looking for a smaller sized (18 inches or smaller) with a higher drive. The low maintenance coat is a plus, but yet they are still furry. I am used to a lot of coat, and having a third dog with a lot of coat I would end up wasting so much time brushing which I already do. The border collie is known for being very biddable and trainable, but honestly bigger than I was originally looking for. The problem with the mudi is I’ve heard a lot of conflicting information on being biddable. Some say they are and easy to train others say prone to reactivity, hard to compete with, and usually unwilling to train. I’ve seen that some mudi do well in multiple different sports too. But also border collies can excel at multiple different sports. 



5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 



Opps sort of already answered this, but looking for a dog I could potentially compete with agility, rally, scent work, barn hunt, fast cat, and dock diving. I also like working on trick titles with my dogs, since it helps to build my dogs learning new things faster the more we problem solve and shape new behaviors. 



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport 



Yes, right now just rally, agility, and fast cat. I am currently on working on scent work with the hopes to start competing next year. My dogs are progressing better than I hoped and so proud of them! I would love to get into some other sports as well such as dock diving  and barn hunt. This is less available in my area so I will need to drive further. But I am excited to try it in the future. 



7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 



Oh my gosh dogs are my life. Besides work I am interacting with them. I have no friends. Well I have one friend who is just as dog crazy as me. Dividing up between my dogs easily like 6-7 hours, between in person classes, training, playing, feeding, enrichment, and walks. 





8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?



As much as they need to be enriched. Again my dogs are my personality. Walking is more for me, but my one dog demands walks at the exact same times every day so they get at least two walks, since that’s what he demands. But sometimes it’s three. No dog parks, yikes. I have fenced in back yard for off leash fun. Hiking, and lots of training, puzzle games or licky mats for a calming behavior. 



9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional? 



Well I do all my own grooming. I have two rough collies, so when I say I groom a lot, I groom a lot. Plus my one rough collie’s favorite activity is to find burr bushes in the forest. Nails and hair between pads get done once a week. Brushing pretty much daily. Cleaning ears when needed. And brushing teeth daily. I do not mind the grooming, but having a lighter coat than a rough collie might be nice. 



10) What size dog are you looking for?



More on the smaller side/medium. Maybe more like 20-40 pound range. My current are 55 pounds and 70 pounds. I have a collie that is half an inch over sized now and a collie just barely meeting standard both male. So I’m looking for something a little smaller and more agile. 



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



Used to shedding, my dogs love to bark, barking does not bother me. Slobber not an issue

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



My county has strict leash laws. No off Leash dogs.



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



I like a snuggly dog, but not a dog that wants to live in my skin. Some of the Aussies I’ve dog sat where they are not happy unless they are practically wearing you. Aussies are a little too clingy. Maybe dial it back by one and I can handle anything from that point and lower 



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I like eager to please 



15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

 I do not care either way if they greet or bark.  If a tendency I am willing to train a place behavior at a young age to prevent issues.



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I do not love the idea, but things happen. I am willing to face whatever happens. I do need a dog that can learn to coexist with other dogs though even if management is needed. 



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I can’t deal with dog that just is completely uninterested in learning new things. 



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



2-3 hours, max 4. I work remote most times, and have set up for them family to be with them when I do work. 



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

No preferences. 



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?



I have two rough collies and a rabbit. I do have a rabbit most of the time he allowed loose in the house. Mudi vs Border collie being with small animals? My rabbit is a larger rabbit and punches the dogs if they get in his face too much. 



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Nope, house with backyard 



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

No, I live in Indiana . The only thing is the city limits I live in do have strict leash laws. 



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Uh winter like 20 F

Summer up to 90 F. I would say summer normally is more like 80 F.

We get all the seasons. But most of the summer is not that hot. 



Anyone that is familiar with Mudi or Border collies I really would love to go with what best fits my life. My friend has a border collie, and I have met more border collies than Mudis, but my biggest concern with Border collies is the higher prey drive, and larger size.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, I've had dogs for the majority of my life. I've had mystery mutts, GSD mixes, husky mix, and a hound mix

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I'm getting a little disheartened with shelters after my latest rescues. I prefer to rescue, but I'm definitely open to a breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Not genetically prone to reactivity! I'm a little burned out with reactive dogs. I love my two german shepherd mixes. I love the bond between a herding dog and their person.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I like labradors and golden retrievers in terms of intelligence and personality. I had a lab mix, and he was a great dog. The only drawback is that the bond didn't feel as close as my GSD mixes. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic obedience. Nothing too special. This dog would be a companion dog.

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

dogs,[Advice] My dog hates crows,"Hi!

I have a 6 year old Pomeranian who loses her ever loving mind when she hears crows.

Pomeranians are barky dogs and that hasn’t been too much of a problem. From an early age I taught her the command “quiet” and she’s still very good at it.

Except when it comes to crows. 

I live in a rural area, there’s a murder of crows that live nearby. Their numbers keep growing. 

Idk what it is about a crow’s caw but she goes ballistic. She runs around barking, even when her trachea collapses because of how worked up she got, she still tries to bark and run. When we’re outside and she hears it, she barks and charges in the direction of the caw like she’s gonna do something about it.

The crows have learned they trigger her. 

This is where the nightmare has begun. 

They come at all hours of the day. The worst is in the early morning right outside my bedroom window. 

My dog doesn’t respond when I tell her to quiet when she’s raging over these birds. It’s like she can’t even hear me over herself and can only focus on them taunting her. I get concerned with how it sometimes exacerbates her trachea and I’m none too pleased being woken up.

Does anyone have any advice on how to either manage my dog’s attitude towards the crows or keep the crows at bay? ",1730399090.0
dogs,About my dogs behaviour,"Hello people of reddit, I 23F have a male golden retriever that is going to turn 5 very soon. He is a sweetheart and can be stubborn at times, but the reason I am creating this post is to ask some questions about some of his behaviours which I would like to be explained.
1. Sometimes he will raise his upper lip, maybe both or just one side, like once I was playing with him asking loudly where he was and he had his lip up, I don't know if this expression is because he is confused or amused by a game he doesn't understand
2. So, he is very possessive of his toys, when he is laying down on the bed or other things, if I kiss him he will lightly growl, the strange this is, if I leave him alone he will look behind is back as if he didn't expect, I know he doesn't do it to threat me, I just wonder why
Thanks for anyone that can help me :)",1730392626.0

My question is, would it be okay to use those and spray it on their play/sleeping area? Or would it cause them stress and make the area repulsive for them to stay in? The area they sleep/play in is an enclosed outdoor area.

dogs,Refusing to Move When Not Getting His Way on Walks,"I am having issues with my recent rescue refusing to move when he doesn’t get his way on walks. 

Background: I adopted him three months ago from the county shelter. Most likely a Black Mouth Cur mix, maybe lab. He is 70lbs. Strong tracking and direction memory. He has developed points of interests: houses with cats, dogs he likes, a dog park he tracked to on his own, etc. He does not sleep with me and is served his meals after I have eaten. He does not eat from plates or share food. 

He has no other behavior issues. Most of them time on walks he is excellent: loose lead, no pulling, no reactivity, sits down when he is commanded, sits when he sees other dogs. He is a highly intelligent dog and I am impressed by his ability to create routes from memory. I provide high value treats he only receives on walks.

He sets out each morning with a destination in mind. The distance is not the issue. We have many routes roughly the same amount of steps. I am happy he is comfortable in his new setting and has expanded his boundaries. 

The issue comes in when he wants to cross the street, go a certain direction, go further on a walk. If I do not have a high value treat he likes, he refuses to move. He will sit down and eventually lay down. If I move in the direction he wants, he immediately gets up and walks. This is most prevalent on our morning walks. We are typically out the door no later than 6:15am after waking around 5:45am. 

Today’s walk took an extra 35 minutes due to this. Two blocks took 20 minutes as he wanted to cross the street, we had already walked for an hour. I physically pushed him eventually as rush hour traffic had started. He will stop in the middle of an intersection when I will not go his direction. Even when I make him sit before we cross he will pull towards his way and then sit down. 

We live in the center of a major city. He is not reactive to sounds or cars. I have had to physically pull him up and off a busy street. I use a collar and short lead. I volunteer with horses and use a very similar pattern as I would to move a horse. Horses are easier at this point. 

I am at my wits end as I am not willing to be led by him and tired of setting out on walks unsure of his mood. In terms of exercise, we get plenty of steps in and he has games and puzzles at home. 

Any help is appreciated! ",1730380867.0

dogs,"[RIP] Sonny, Pinscher, 15","I wrote the text bellow on 4/10/23. This is a long text about the passing of my beloved and first dog, Sonny. I just felt like today sharing it somewhere. The pain is still here ♥️ I was 11 years old when my mother gifted him to me, my mother always said Sonny was his son, and I always said Sonny was my brother. He will be forever and ever be my older brother ♥️ Even at this moment writing this single paragraph brings tears in my eyes. I still think about him every single day, sometimes I cry, sometimes I get sad, sometimes I smile remembering his happiness, but I am always grateful I had him in my life. I miss you so much my forever brother 🌈💖

I could not upload a photo of him here. Those who are interested I uploaded a photo of him . ♥️

----- 🌈🌈🌈

I lost my 15 year old male pinscher on 4/6/2023, this week, his name was Sonny, he had grade D heart failure, the most advanced grade, mitral valve disease, pulmonary hypertension, pericardial effusion, three herniated discs and he couldn't walk anymore (I bought him a dog wheelchair)... I took him in the backyard to do his things holding him in a cloth, last week I noticed he was getting extremely tired only peeing... He used to take about 15 pills a day, all drugs available on the market, all exams, echocardiograms he did... His desire to live was immense, last Wednesday he had an appointment scheduled with the cardiologist and the echocardiogram, the news was sad, he needed hospitalization, and the guarantee of survival was low, the costs were absurdly high just for a single day of hospitalization, he didn't want to stay, he looked right into my eyes asking to leave, also, there was a veterinary student accompanying the cardiologist, I knew that a case like that was very interesting to be studied, I knew that if I left him there, they would study him, I asked the cardiologist to prescribe home medication and took him home, his condition instantly worsened at home, he couldn't breathe, gave emergency diuretic drugs waiting for them to act, they did not act, he stayed from 4 pm until 9 pm with his head tilted up trying to breathe, I held his head part of the time, put pillows for him to support, stayed by his side, it was the most terrible hours of my life... When I wrapped him in the blanket he looked right into my eyes, he put his little nose on mine, twice, looking right at me, I felt his soul, I didn't know what that meant at the time, but it was his farewell to me... It will stay in my heart forever. I took him back to the veterinary emergency, I took some pictures and recorded a video of him in my mother's arms, he was barely breathing, weakened, tired, with his head up, closing his eyes, looking like he wanted to sleep... They took him to ER, minutes later the veterinarian on duty said that he had a cardiac arrest and had to be intubated... He was injected with adrenaline, he was on oxygen, the vet let me see him intubated, it devastated me, she showed me a vat full of blood and fluid, she said it drained through intubation, the laryngoscope was full of blood, and the cloth where his mouth was resting was also full of blood with clots... I left the room, I cried and cried, I scratched my arms, he was my little baby and I couldn't do anything... The vet said she would try until 2 am, if not, she would stop doing things because it was suffering for him...I walked into the emergency room and kissed him on the cheek and told him I loved him... I went back home and at exactly 2:4 am, the veterinarian called and sent messages saying that he couldn't resist, he had several cardiac arrests... On the morning of 4/6/23 I picked him up, they delivered him in a cardboard box, I didn't have enough courage to open it, me, my uncle and my mother buried him in a beautiful place... With several birds singing, under a coconut tree, my uncle placed white flowers on top... On the 08/04/23, I was crying in the morning, and I asked God and him if he wanted to see me happy he would send me any sign as little as possible, and oddly enough as soon as I asked for it I heard two little screams from him, it was him, I remember clearly, the screams came and went quickly, I asked again but I didn't hear anything else... Today is 04/10/23, and everything reminds me of him, everything, every corner of the house, everything looks like him, I took everything related to him and put it in a separate drawer in my wardrobe, even the little plants where he peed, I kept his fur, clothes, cloths, pillows... Not an hour goes by without me crying, I know it's bad for him and he doesn't want to see me crying, but I can't stand it, the loss is devastating, it's like I've lost part of my own soul. I'm taking sleeping pills every day, sleeping pills almost all the time, I try not to cry but I can't, I know it makes him sad but I just can't... I pray every day, I hope he appears to me, at least in a dream, I ask God, but so far nothing... 
I believe in spiritism, I believe that our beloved animals after they die stay with us for a while and then reincarnate, they evolve, I just knew these days about The Rainbow Bridge, it is a beautiful theory, I believe in part of it, I believe that while our animals wait to reincarnate they stay in that place, sometimes transiting, visiting beloved people and going to that place before reincarnation, the book of Ernesto Bozzano ""Do animals have soul?"" Is a beautiful book, filled with stories about animal reincarnation, stories of animals returning to their owners and about spiritualism... 
It's the first time I write about everything that happened to Sonny and probably the last, I hoped for a miracle but it didn't happen, God knows everything... I had the privilege of having the presence of my beloved dog for 15 years, i have pictures with him when I was a kid, he loved walking, he would jump very high before walking, he made extreme use of his little legs before he stopped walking, he was a very loved dog, very happy, before I took him to the vet on 04/05/23, I carried him in my arms around the street he used to walk, and I swear by all the holiest, he smiled, he smiled seeing the street he used to walk, i'll never forget. I keep praying, I keep crying, I keep waiting for him to appear for me, he was my first dog, he accompanied me for most of my life, from childhood to adulthood, he was a brother to me and a son to my mother. I miss him a lot, I pray that God with the help of the angels will allow me to see him, even for a second... 
He was named after a true story of reincarnation,  for those who are curious there is a film ""Yesterday's Children"" and several documentaries about the history... My dear Sonny...

I Love You Sonny, Forever and Ever, for the rest of my life and beyond space and time...

dogs,Asking for a Breed Recommendation,"    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * This is my first dog, and I have lived with dogs my entire life and done work to take care of the family dog 
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]
    
    * I definitely want to rescue a dog, I do not want to breed.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * Cuddly, loving of not just me but everyone they meet, and energetic enough to go outside and play at least once a day.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * I am interested in a boxer, they are energetic, playful, silly, and super cute. I also grew up with lab-boxer mixes so I have some experience with them.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Not bark when I am gone, play fetch, and not jump on people when I have friends over.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * I don't really want to do any sport or work with them. I would be interested in doing hikes with them possibly off-leash so that's the extent of training I would be interested in.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * I could devote up to an hour a day training while they are young, but I'd love to cuddle and play with them around the house most of the time while I'm home which is roughly 8 hours a day.
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * I want to play/workout with my dog roughly an hour a day. Just long walks/hikes, short runs, or just playing fetch sounds fun to me.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * I can brush them and groom them every day if needed. But I also have the money to pay for professionals to do it if that would be better for a certain breed.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * I would prefer large or medium but not against having a small dog either. X-large would probably not be ideal however.
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * I can handle a lot of shedding it doesn' really bother me, barking is fine with me but I'd prefer it if they didn't bark when i was gone to annoy the neighbors. Slobber isn't a big deal either, I have had dogs who were water fountains.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * I would definitely like to be able to train them to do this without running off or attacking another animal/dog.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Definitely a snuggly dog.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * I would prefer a dog that wanted to please/love me.
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * I would like my dog to be lovey to everyone and not be violent if someone enters our yard/house. 
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * I would prefer to not do this, I don't know if I want the responsibility of owning an often-agressive breed.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * That's about it.
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * I go to work from 9-5 so they will have to be alone then, however my career has lots of WFH opprotunities so I most likely will be able to do that at least once a week.
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * I only live with people who also have experienced/love dogs. They most likely won't take tons of care of him as I don't want to make it their responsibility.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * No other pets, I just want a dog.
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * I am single and young so they will not be interacting with kids often.
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * I rent, however most of the homes I have rented do not have any strict weight restrictions. However, because I am renting that is why I don't reall want a X-large breed as I feel I just wouldn'thave the space to make them comfortable.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * I am from Saint Louis and I don't know if any breeds are banned. 
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * It can get super hot in the summer (<100) and can get chilly in the winter (>10)

dogs,Morning routine for pups?,"Hi all. I recently got a black lab puppy who really tests my limits but is the absolutely love of my life. He is 3 months old, and I am really struggling with mornings with him. He usually sleeps through the night, but lately has been whining to pee and poop between 4 and 530. He usually will settle after a bit and go to sleep until 6/630 but is absolutely crazy when he wakes up. He bites, chews everything, barks, etc. I live in New England in a wooded area so as of now when we wake up it’s still dark out and the animals are still lurking. So here is our current routine 

6/630: wake up, potty, and play - this is when he’s crazy and it can last an hour depending on the time he wakes up. I don’t even have time to pee in the morning. I wish I could let him run around at this time but I can’t. 

7: eat (half a cup in a slow feeder, the other half cup with a rolling dispenser for enrichment). Potty after eating. 

720: chewing on bones, playing, or getting into mischief. It’s light out by this time so we will usually go outside but I also need to pee, brush my teeth, make coffee, etc 

750: sit by open window and look outside 

8: train 

830: 1.5 mile walk 

9: teething time while I work 

930: first nap 

So is there anything else I should be implementing? He is so high energy and I am on the struggle bus and end everyday with a massive headache. Any tips in the morning when it’s too dark out to play?

dogs,Question about Cane Corso and disabled dogs ,"I don't want to use the Cane Corso sub as they are in favour of some things I can't support.

I'm interested in fostering (either life long foster or foster to adopt) a mentally disabled Cane Corso mix with mental health problems (both stemming from what was done to him before he was rescued). I seem to fit his needs and he is right up my ally and right up those problems I can deal with very well.

I'm physically disabled but see no bigger problem as I've easily managed a very ill trained mastiff in puberty that had about the same format. I've also been accidentally injured by a dog half that size snd weight because his two sole brain cells were swept into his balls by puberty and he forgot he was leashed (but still managed to safely get him and two other dogs out of the situation and walked back home). I know I have to train him well and will use security equipment (I have a belt to secure dogs that size in case I can't hold them with my arms and am a lot heavier than the dog) but that I can manage. I also have equipment to assist if his exercise needs go beyond my strength for a time (very sturdy scooter gifted to me at one of the times my health was at it's worst, also tried by the mastiff plus my late boy, I took her out with us while her owners wheelchair was broken).

For days I'm useless or when I'm in hospital my mom takes care of my dog/foster and here lies the problem. She's also easily managed the mastiff but is convinced that it wasn't so easy because she did well but because the mastiff was so in love with me (I wasn't always there when she was out and about with her). I know my mom, I know her abilities (she successfully took the exam our region requires to handle dogs that are deemed a public danger, she successfully handled the dogs I had in the past and I know the Cane Corso will steal her heart faster than she can stuff him with treats. 

Before I reassure my mother that I know she will handle him I want to have some input from others if there's anything I overlook. I know the typical character traits and behaviours of the breed and I know the specific personality, problems and features of this specific dog. He's not the smartest but eager to please which makes training a lot easier. I know they have a lot of energy and he'll probably not get much out via mental stimulation until I find the right methods for his abilities. I also know that his ""lot of energy"" is a bit below that of other's of his age and breed due to his illness and medication. He's housebroken, a sweetheart and needs to slowly learn that being alone doesn't mean he'll be abandoned and neglected again, which works well with someone who can't work and has time to work on that. He's also not a hunter and fine with other dogs. I'm yet to find out how he is with cars but that can be worked around until tackled if necessary.

Did I miss anything that might be a problem for someone else caring for him?


Edit due to misunderstandings: I do not want to convince my mom that this dog is right for her. I also do not want us to foster a dog we can't properly care for. That would suck for all three of us. I want to reassure her of her abilities and if there's no information contrary to what we found out, that she can handle him. If there's things we don't know that show she (or I) can't handle him I need to know that so I don't accidentally convince her instead of reassuring her of her abilities. I'd be totally fine if she said ""I can easily handle this dog but it's just not worth the effort to me, so let's look for a different dog."" I'd however be very sad if she thought she's ""not good enough"" to handle a dog when she is. That point is about reassuring someone who suffers from self-doubt, not about convincing someone to get a specific dog. I'll happily foster a tiny mutt again, but I don't want her to feel bad about herself.",1730370094.0

dogs,"Aggression, growling, + alcohol?","Hi! My partner and I have an 80-something lbs Alaskan Malamute / German Shepherd Mixed Breed Dog who’ll be turning 3 in November.

We adopted him from a rescue when he was 2 months old. We were told his litter was abandoned in the woods.

He’s super smart, picks up on things quickly, and has a huge goofy personality which we love, but  he’s also pretty skittish. Any “aggression” seems to be fear based or when he’s overstimulated and we’re trying to work on building his confidence. This looks like barking/growling when I (28F) take him for walks and a man walks past us or if he’s being surrounded by strangers.

Earlier this year, our dog started growling at my partner (28M) when he came home after drinking alcohol. It initially felt really random and we were confused because our dog would go back to being playful/cuddly in the morning. We eventually picked up on the pattern that he only does this when my partner has had something to drink. — My partner has never been physical/abusive nor does he drink to the point of acting super erratic. I can only assume it’s the way my partner smells when he drinks? — I’m not sure what else would be the cause since our dog only lives with the both of us and we adopted him at such a young age I can’t imagine he’s had a bad experience with someone + alcohol prior.

Lately it seems like even after having just one beer, our dog is growling at my partner — but not right away? My partner would have a beer and 1-2hrs later they’ll be playing and all of a sudden he’ll just give a low/deep growl. He won’t bare his teeth, but when my partner tries talking to him he’ll hide his face and try to avoid facing him + continue groaning/growling. Or he’ll come and try to hide his face on my lap/behind me.

We’re not sure how to combat this besides having my partner ignore him whenever he’s had something to drink. I’m not sure if this is enabling this behavior either though or if this is something we should seek a behaviorist for. Any thoughts or suggestions?

Thank you so much in advance!

Note: I’m not much of a drinker, but there was one night earlier this year where he did growl at me too. (Same night where we realized it’s the alcohol) — Our dog is also intact too, not sure if this will matter but thought I’d mention it anyway.

dogs,How can I stop my dog from barking?,"I recently got a Maltese x shitsu puppy from my mum. She’s 6 months old and only a couple months ago she would bark at dogs she could hear in the distance or random noises that scare her at night when taking her to the toilet. Usually if I tell her to stop she will, so when I’m around it’s not really an issue.

My housemate has a 5 month old golden retriever and he’s gotten too big to be left inside all day so we decided it was time to leave the both of them outside during the day so they’re not cooped up.

I just received a message this morning from a neighbour that my puppy will bark from 8am onwards after I leave for work. I didn’t realise she was doing this and am unsure as to what I can do as I’m not home to teach her it’s not okay.

I’m hoping someone has some tips as to what I can do to prevent her from barking nonstop as when I leave and come home I don’t hear her barking at all and she doesn’t do it enough when I’m at home to try and correct it. ",1730347682.0
dogs,Crate training dog ,"I have a six-month-old Eskimo, and overall, he’s been easy to crate train. Once he’s in, he doesn’t cry, and he doesn’t whine in the morning to be let out either. The challenge I’m facing is actually getting him into the crate. He’ll happily run into his crate when I feed him his meals, and sometimes during the day, I can say ‘crate,’ and he’ll go in, and I’ll reward him. However, at night, he refuses to go in, even for high-value treats. Based on my research, dogs are supposed to love their crate if you train them correctly, but he doesn’t seem to enjoy it. He doesn’t go in during the day or for naps. I’ve tried giving him high-reward treats, all his meals, and enrichment activities in the crate, I have tried the cover to make it den that, it’s comfy in there I do training games with the crate and crate him even when I’m home so he doesn’t associate crate with me being gone but he still refuses to go in and it’s a 20 minute struggling trying to trick him to go in at night or when leaving for the day. Any tips?

dogs,Is My Rescue’s Excitement a Problem?,"Hi everyone! I recently adopted a 1-year-old rescue, and we’ve had her for about three weeks now. She’s absolutely adorable and super affectionate, but I’ve noticed some mouthing behavior I’m unsure about.

Whenever I walk through the door, or even if I’ve just been away for an hour or so, she gets REALLY excited to see me. She’ll grab onto my clothes with her mouth and gently tug, trying to get me down to her level. She will be shaking with excitement, eyes closed, ears down, tail wagging ferociously, and holding onto my clothes. It’s super cute, and she’s never aggressive or biting hard. It’s more like she’s mouthing at me in excitement.

We’ve been trying to redirect her energy with a toy, which works pretty well—she’ll grab it and hold on happily. She’s generally non compliant when we say no biting, but if we use our outdoor voice and say “No biting!” She will kind of stop. But I’m wondering if this mouthing behavior is something I should be concerned about. She also likes to mouth our wrists and hands when she plays, again, very gently, never hard biting.

Is this something I should work on discouraging, or is it generally okay since she’s not being aggressive? Thanks for any advice or similar experiences!",1730341479.0

I recently got a new puppy and she is the sweetest and most active dog that I have ever had! But she is doing something that I do not know yet how to teach her that it’s not okay.

Even when I’m in the same room as her, next to her, she would start barking, or if I’m doing house chores and I’m just standing up and she is on the floor she would start barking too, or when there’s an object that makes her unable to see me (we are in the same room) she would start barking again, when I make eye contact she would stop barking but as soon as I stop giving her eye contact she would start again (?)

So I’m not sure yet how to teach her how to not do it, or I’m not even sure why is she even doing it lol

dogs,[Advice Needed] Struggling with Leash Training Our New Rescue,"Hey everyone,

My fiancée and I recently rescued a 1-year-old Japanese Spitz, whom we’ll call “Spot,” about four weeks ago. She’s a 25-pound bundle of energy who came all the way from South Korea, where she spent a large portion of her life in a cage. Adjusting to life in NYC (specifically Brooklyn) has been an interesting journey for all of us!

The Good Stuff:
Spot’s been amazing in many ways. She’s surprisingly chill with the usual city chaos – sirens, trucks, people, you name it. She’s also okay being left alone for a few hours without any major issues, and we’ve only had a few minor potty training hiccups indoors.

The Challenge:
The biggest problem we’re facing is leash training. Spot’s foster family admitted she didn’t receive any formal training and was allowed to pull and sniff as she pleased. Since adopting her, we’ve watched a ton of YouTube videos, and we even brought in a professional trainer who we meet once every two weeks, who suggested a pinch/prong collar. The trainer spent a couple of hours with us to make sure we’re using it properly and even provided us with personalized videos for extra guidance.

While the collar has definitely made walks more manageable, she still doesn’t really focus on me when we’re walking, even though I’m offering treats and using a clicker to reinforce good behavior. It feels like I’m correcting her every few steps, and at this point, it’s been two weeks with minimal improvement – if anything, it seems like she’s starting to ignore the collar entirely.

Our Question:
For those of you who’ve had success with leash training rescues, especially dogs who might not have had any early guidance, how long did it take for things to “click”? Did you find certain techniques worked better over time? I’m trying to stay patient and consistent, but any advice or personal experiences would be super helpful!

Thanks in advance!",1730336362.0

dogs,"[RIP] Jasper, Bichon Frise, 14","Earlier today, my best boy was put to sleep and my heart is broken. He was a bichon frise and the most gentle dog I've ever met. He was a massive wimp but he absolutely loved everything and everyone.

He was coming up 15 in three months but he acted like a puppy till the end. He barked at his food and threw his biscuits around almost every single day, he'd playfight with my mum when she'd get in from work, even when he would get tired after about 30 seconds.

His decline was steady but then he fell rapidly. He was deaf and blind for a while, but when the dementia went full force, he hardly knew what was going on around him. His legs were weak, even smoothing his back could make him buckle, he'd lost over a kilogram since we last took him to the vet a year ago. He didn't really respond to being petted, he wandered around aimlessly and just stared into space.

The vet told my parents that it was the right time and that he probably would've done the same, which makes us all feel a little less guilty. I want to think that putting him to sleep was a kindness but it is so hard to tell yourself that when it actually comes down to it. We all knew this day was coming soon, and it made us sad to watch him exist without living.

Hopefully he can be with our other bichon who died 2 years ago, he was infatuated with her so I know he'd love to see her again.

Rest in peace Jasper, my sweet boy",1730336314.0
dogs,Cheyenne,"I lost my girl 3 weeks ago and I just needed to share.

Yesterday I got red ferns added to Cheyenne’s paw print tattoo. Inspired by the book, Where the Red Fern Grows, I knew it was something that I would add once I said goodbye each of the animals. Getting the piece done, though, has had a different effect than I thought it would. I thought it would help me feel better… make Cheyenne feel closer somehow. Instead, it makes it final. I know it was final before, but I still expected to see her staring in the window or hear her tail thumping against the wall.

She’s not the first dog I’ve mourned: Delilah, when I was 7; Max, when I was 13; Misty; Sadie; Ranger… And I know that big dogs don’t last long into double digits. So with a 10 year-old and a 12 year old, I’d been trying to prepare myself for the eventual goodbye. I had an idea of what to look out for to signal that it was time and I had a plan for them to go to rest at home. I wanted everyone to be able to say goodbye and for the animals to feel loved.

Cropper is 12 and slower and grayer, while Cheyenne still sprinted and bounced around like a puppy. I thought Cropper would leave me first, so I hugged him just a little tighter and a couple seconds longer. I thought I had more time with Cheyenne.

It was a Wednesday morning when she was unable to walk on her back leg. Poor girl, dragged herself around the house - still trying to sprint to her treats - on just her front legs. Luckily, I was able to get an appointment for her the next morning and in true Cheyenne fashion, she bounced into the vet as if nothing was wrong. In fact the text I sent Husband was, “That bitch walked in there,” at which he laughed. The vet said she looked like she was in great shape and her bloodwork from a few months ago was perfect.

We should have had more time.

Friday we gave her the prescribed pain meds and tried to have her take it easy because she was intermittently having leg issues. No pain meds Saturday and she seemed to be moving normally. Sunday we tried to take her for a walk. Not even a quarter mile from the house, she sat down, obviously not quite ready to go further. As we headed back to the house, I decided to take Cropper around the block thinking, “We should probably get them used to walking separately anyways.” Cropper was getting worn out sooner than Cheyenne on walks and I thought we’d have to shorten his.

We were home just a few minutes later. Husband said he had to carry Cheyenne inside. She was still happy and alert, just relaxing on the floor. I gave her some pain medication and let her rest. Not even an hour later she was seizing. We weren’t sure what was going on and thought it might be a reaction to the medication. We tried to cool her body temperature down and I called an emergency vet, who advised that we bring her in. That ride to the vet was heartbreaking. I know she was scared; I only hope she wasn’t hurting and didn’t feel alone. Husband carried her in. The vet staff performed CPR on her for 8 minutes.

We didn’t get more time.

So now I have these red ferns around my girl’s paw, a broken heart, and the feeling that even for as much as I loved her, I know it wasn’t enough. I thought I had more time. Why did I save any love for later? She deserved so much more than that.

Cheyenne has left a hole so much greater than I imagined it would be. I miss the sound of her chasing the cat or her barking at absolutely nothing in the backyard. I miss being so annoyed by her just staring at me. “Do you want outside? Dinner time? No? You just want lovin’?” That’s all she ever wanted: to love and be loved.

As much as I loved that dog, I should have loved her so much more.

I miss you, my sweet girl. I will always regret falling short of what you deserved.

dogs,Am I crazy for getting a third dog?,"I’m hoping there are some positive stories on this thread about owning three dogs. I have a 5 year old mini aussie and a 1 year old labradoodle. Next week I’m getting an 3 month Old English Sheepdog. For context, I live in a house by myself on a small farm, so plenty of land for them to run around. My parents live next door and are willing to help and my boyfriend is offering his support as well. 

My labradoodle loves other dogs and people so not too concerned about her, but my aussie is a bit of a jealous boy. He’s glued to me like velcro. But since he was fine with my doodle after a few months I’m hoping the same will be said for my OES. It’s obviously a risk though. 

I work from home, I make great money and I’m an introvert so my life revolves around my animals and I’m completely content with that. 

TLDR: I see too many online horror stories about people regretting the third dog. I’d really like to see some positive examples of it working out because it’s making me overthink this.

dogs,Thoughts on adopting middle aged/older dogs?,"I’m thinking about adopting a 5 year old golden retriever mix who’s been at a local shelter for the last month or so.  I haven’t done a meet and greet yet, but it sounds like he’s a good boy who really needs a good home.

My biggest hesitation is the age.  I know 5 isn’t exactly geriatric, but it’s not young for a big dog.  I lost my first dog (a cavalier King Charles spaniel) at 15 earlier this year and it was HARD.  He was worth every second, but caring for a senior was a lot of work and expensive, and saying goodbye just about killed me.  I’m feeling pretty hesitant about doing that all over again in the not too distant future.  Especially with a bigger dog who might eventually need mobility help.  I’m in good shape, but I don’t think I could deadlift a 75 lb dog into the bathtub, for example.

On the other hand, I could give this dog a great home. (Assuming he gets along with my current pets).  He’s 5 and being treated for heartworm, so he’s not exactly most people’s first choice compared to all the puppies at this shelter.  And there are some odd parallels with my first dog- same age, same animal shelter, both have/had heart issues, both almost adopted and then turned down by their potential families.  I don’t want to read too much into all of that, but it’s giving me pause.

dogs,"[BREED] My furry companion of many years has grown quite elderly, and I would like to look into getting a new family member to learn from her before her time to cross the rainbow bridge arrives.","\*\*Introduction\*\*

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* No. I grew up with dogs and got ""my"" first dog, a female 3 month old Siberian Husky, when I moved out of my parents house at 18. She has been the best companion, and has gracefully grown quite elderly. Aside from her, I have a male German Shepherd (11 years old) whom I've had since he was 1, and a Nova Scotian Duck Tolling Retriever who recently passed at almost 16 whom I had since she was 8.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

\* I would prefer a rescue, but am not opposed to a breeder. Price is no object.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

\* When the time comes for me to take this step, my intention is for this dog to be my companion. He/she will go most everywhere with me, including work. I lucked out with my husky - despite me knowing very little about training all of those years ago, she learned so incredibly quickly. I was spoiled by her, as most other huskies I've met since haven't been nearly as gentle, maternal, and as obedient as she has been. I'm looking for something highly trainable, intelligent, and loving towards the entire family (i.e., the other dogs and cats, my girlfriend, and nieces and nephews when they occasionally visit.)

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* N/A. I am wanting to learn, as again, I was spoiled with my first one. Aside from size (I prefer medium - XL dogs) I've no oppositions or expectations on what breed to choose from. Jumping in and out of the cab of my truck on their own is ideal.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Staying close to me when not on the leash is a must. Basic commands (sit, come, stay, heel) are also necessities.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* Multiple hours daily.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* 1-2 hours. Fetch, walks, swimming in the river. Not a dog park, but a regular park.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* I can trim nails, but prefer to avoid cutting hair. I'm happy to take him/her to a groomer monthly.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)What size dog are you looking for?

\* Medium - XL

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* Shedding and barking are no concern. I'd like to keep slobbering to a minimum.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Very important.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Snuggly would be ideal, but it is not a deal-breaker.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* More eager-to please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* I don't know if this is an outlandish request or not, but I would like a dog that would notify us of a knock at the door or someone in the yard and then become friendly towards that person upon seeing our reaction to greeting them or via a command.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* One-track-minds. I.e. if it starts chasing a rabbit and ignores commands to return.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* Very seldom, and when he/she is, it wouldn't be longer than 3-4 hours.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* The only other person in the house is my girlfriend, who is also a dog-lover. She will be a large part of the dog's life, as well.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* 1 older male German Shepherd, 1 older corgi mix, 1 scarlet macaw (only ever outside of her cage with my supervision), and 4 inside/outside farm cats.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No, however I would like it to be loving towards my nieces and nephews when they come to visit.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* No.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* I live in an extremely rural area in the Ozark Mountains.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summer - 85 degreees F. Winter - 20 degrees F.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* No additional information.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.",1730321908.0
dogs,Dog does not want to leave house at night,"I rescued a dog last week that is somehow still fully house trained even though he was in the shelter for 9 months. The first couple of days he would hapily go out for a small walk at night. However, the last couple of nights I could barely get him to go into the garden for his last wee. He luckily doesn't wee in the house and would like it to stay that way.

He is okay with me putting his leash on, but before we reach the end of the driveway he goes into a full stop and walks back to the door, without taking a wee. Currently the latest I can get him to go in the garden is around 19:00 when he does one very long wee. I wake up at 7:00 and he gets to go on a walk. In the morning it is dark as well, but that does not seem to be an issue.

Does anyone have advise on how to get him to go on a walk or is it okay for him to hold in his pee this long? ",1730234373.0
dogs,Preparing For My Second Dog,"**Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

* No. My shetland sheepdog sadly passed away at the age of 10 at the beginning of October due to a brain tumour. I still need some time to process losing her and reflect on the time we shared together, and I'd like to use this post as an opportunity to sort my own thoughts, as well as collect the opinions of others. I'm a veterinary nurse with a keen interest in animal behaviour that I'd like to develop into a professional qualification in the coming years. For now, I've done the Fear Free Certification and Dogs Trust's Dog Friendly Nursing courses, which both focus on minimising patient anxiety and stress in the clinic. I also volunteered with a dog rescue for a year during my studies, and do dog walking for my neighbours dogs (a collie/akita and gsd/husky) three to four times a week.

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

* I've got a slight tendency towards breeder, since I would like to have a fresh start with training to try and build good behaviours from the very beginning of the dog's life. That being said, I'm open minded: if the right dog for me appears in a shelter, I've got no issues with going down this route.

**Describe your ideal dog.**

* I'm looking for a life companion that can share a very close bond with me. I communicate better with dogs than with people, and would like an animal who loves being around me as much as I do them. A dog that's intelligent enough to really engage with training, but still enjoys lots of physical contact would be nice. I also enjoy gaming, so a dog that wouldn't mind cuddling up under my desk at the end of the day is a nice thought.

**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

* I'm very passionate about herding dogs, particularly border collies, but I really like German, Australian and Bohemian Shepherds too. I think their emotional intelligence is incredible, and their sensitive natures seem to be a good fit for my personality, as the ones I've met throughout my life seem to have bonded with me quite quickly. I seem to get on very well with fear-aggressive dogs, and have a preference for long-haired breeds. It's selfish, but I've also got a massive thing for tricolours.

**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? \*Basic commands (sit, paw, etc) Off leash training.**

* My focus is on trick training and desensitization. I want to work with my dog to ensure he's open to new experiences and isn't frightened of the world. I'd also like to teach tricks that involve me, such as running between my legs, jumping into my arms etc.

**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

* ﻿﻿Not particularly, though if the dog's drive demands it it's something I'm happy to explore. I don't have experience in these fields.

**How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

* I'm happy to involve my dog in all elements of my life. Several hours per day split between walking, grooming, enrichment and TLC are fine by me. In order to accomodate this I've recently moved job to a practice that allows us to bring pets to work, so the dog would be getting enrichment and attention from several different people throughout the day as well.

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

* I'm happy to do two, hour-long walks per day. I'd like to avoid dog parks as I would prefer to remain in control of the interactions my dog has rather than being forced in to situations by off-lead dogs.

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

* ﻿﻿Happy to do routine brushing on a weekly basis. My last dog had 6-weekly grooming appointments, which I'd gladly continue for my next dog. I'm not great at clipping fur and making it look good, but I can do nails, anal glands, and ear cleaning at home.

**What size dog are you looking for?**

* Medium to large feels right, so in the range of 15-30kg. I want a dog large enough to roughouse and cuddle with, but small enough that I could pick up and carry in an emergency, and not strong enough to pull me off my feet.

**How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

* Shedding and barking were my last dog's main past times, so no issues there! I'd like to be able to keep the barking under control however. I'd like to avoid slobber if possible.

**How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

* Not important. I don't plan on letting the dog off-leash at any point.

**Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

* Definitely snuggly. I want a dog that has no concept of personal space. I think dogs that press right up against your body are the absolute cutest thing.

**Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that's more eager-to-please?**

* A bit of a mix, honestly. I'd like a dog that is keen to please for training purposes, however I like the idea of them surprising me on their own initiative too!

**How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

* I'd like them to be friendly to aloof, if possible. A bit of initial barking is fine, but my last dog did have a tendency to start barking at people on walks if we stopped to chat, which is something I'd like to try and train out this time around.

**Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

* Not particularly - due to the close proximity to other dogs at my work, I really need a dog that is comfortable around both dogs and people.

**Are there any other behaviors you can't deal with or want to avoid?**

* ﻿﻿Separation anxiety
* Hereditary health conditions, wherever possible. Main reason flat-coated retrievers are off the list are due to their predisposition to cancers. I understand all purebreeds have issues, but would like to minimise this as much as I can.

**How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

* At work, likely around 4 hours at a time max, though they will be in the vicinity of animals and people throughout the day. I also plan on leaving them at home a few times a week, and I've agreed with a friend that he will come and dog sit on these days. I work ten hour shifts four days a week, so maybe 2 days in the house, 2 in the office to help avoid them becoming too fixated on me.

**What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

* I will be living alone when buying my next dog.

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

* No other pets at the moment, though I do like the idea of owning two dogs, but likely no more than that.

**Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

* No - I have a 3 and 8 year old niece, but visits from them would be rare. Both are accustomed to dogs, though the youngest is still a little anxious around them.

**Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

* No - going straight for home ownership. Currently looking at two bedroom bungalows with flat, fenced-in gardens.

**What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

* Fife, UK. Our banned breeds at XL Bullies, Pitbulls, Japanese Toas, Dogo Argentinos, and Fila Brasileiros, none of which are breeds I'm particularly interested in.

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

* Between -7c and 25c, with most temperatures being in the 10-15c range.

**Any other info that may be helpful?**

* I'm still not considering getting another dog until my life and my own health are in a better place to accomodate them. I'm planning on purchasing a home within the next year, and fingers crossed will have recieved a promotion at work by then to create some further financial stability.
* As an aside, I'm particularly fond of my neighbour's collie/akita cross, though in reality he's more like a very large collie. I don't want a dog that is *like* him, but I want to love my next dog as much as I love both him and my sheltie.",1730316384.0
dogs,How to Train a Dog to be Less Aggressive Towards Small Animals,"I wasn't sure whether to flair this as behavior or training, but I have a 6 year old hound/boxer mix. I adopted him around a year ago not expecting to have another kind of animal in the house, as the reason he was given to the shelter is that he was killing his previous owner's chickens. However, I am planning on moving with my gf at the end of next summer, and she owns an 11 year old cat. Although neither of our pets are young, they're not old and neither have any major health issues, meaning that they'll need to be introduced to each other and be in the same house. I have read up on how to introduce cats and dogs, but since my dog has killed small animals in the past, I am unsure how he is going to take having a cat in the same house as him. He has not been anywhere near a cat since I adopted him, but I have seen him alert on small animals outside (armadillos/squirrels/etc) and I really can't imagine he will be any different towards a cat. Is there a good way to get him to stop being aggressive towards smaller animals before the move in? I'd rather avoid doing all the training when we're living together and try to start it beforehand.",1730237722.0
dogs,How to process grief and guilt with your childhood dog?,"My childhood dog’s 15th birthday today, as was a vet appointment. We were told quite unexpectedly that we should put her down. They booked her in for tomorrow morning. We knew she was having health issues, but it was way more serious than we thought.

I know most people help themselves to grieve by reassuring themselves about the dog’s long, good life. However, I’m not so sure we gave her the best life.

Yes, she was always fed and bathed and spoiled with toys. She was never crated, and everyone who came by the house would greet her and loved her. But never went for walks, always had long nails, and wasn’t allowed on furniture. When she was little (and I was a child), my family used to punish her for accidents by using Cesar Milan’s methods, or putting her in the garage for hours on end.

Now that I have a dog of my own as an adult, I know what we did was wrong when training her. I know she deserved more outdoor time walking or play time too.

How do I grieve her and let her go? What do I do with this guilt that I should’ve been better?",1730257447.0

dogs,Help - I don’t like my dog and it’s almost been a year owning him,"I always liked the idea of one day owning a dog but I didn’t think that would be for years. A close family member started suffering with health issues and was going to have to give away her 7 month male chihuahua. She was desperate to keep him in the family and really pushed me and my partner to have him. It was a fast turn around and it didn’t give me much time to mentally prepare. 

Intially my three cats hated him (of course) but with some gentle introductions my two older cats mostly ignore him. The youngest cat likes to play but he gets too rough with her and I have to constantly micro manage them. He always ends up taking it to far. 

He has lots lf toys and always has a chewy bone which he enjoys. I take him for a mid day 20 min walk and he goes out in our garden (which is big) in the mornings and afternoons and any time he wants on the weekend. 

Initially I enjoyed playtime with him, and still do however, my want to play with him is just getting weaker and weaker the more I grow to dislike him. I constantly feel guilty when people fawn over him, thinking he would probably be much better loved elsewhere.

So here are the issues causing our relationship to be so bad:

He is always getting into fights with my older cats as he will try and play with them

He always takes playing with my younger cat too far and it causes me stress

He has started to chew my skirting boards and damage my house even though he has ample toys and space.

He is very licky and I can’t get him to ever calm down. I just want to sit with him or lie down but he will immediately be all over me no matter what.

He always seems hyperactive and follows me everywhere 

I never imagined chihuahuas being calm dogs and maybe he is still young but it seems no matter what I do he is never calm and will try and destroy anything behind my back.

When I look at him I just feel annoyed and frustrated. I kept thinking this feeling would go over time as we grew closer but I just don’t feel any connection to him at all. He just feels like a day to day chore and I feel guilty that I don’t love him. What do I do?",1730243844.0
dogs,anyone else’s dog shedding like crazy this year? ,"Hello! My german shepherd (3F, spayed) has been shedding an unusual amount this year, like full on blew her entire undercoat. She’s never shed this much before during shedding season. She went from being a double coat to single coat dog 😅

We just had her annual checkup and the vet said a lot of the dogs she had seen recently also had very thin coats. Her bloodwork came back completely normal and she’s eating, drinking, pooping just fine. Diet and exercise has been the same too. I’m in the SF bay area and it’s been an extremely long and hot summer for us up until a couple weeks ago, so maybe it’s caused by the unusual weather. She’s totally normal otherwise so I was just wondering if this has been happening to any other dogs out there!

dogs,My dog initiated a fight with our new cat. ,"We recently got a new cat, kitten is likely the proper term because he is definitely still a baby. 

We’ve had Baxter our pittie mix for nearly a year now. He’s always been nice around our toddlers, other animals, and even extremely gentle with our 2 month old baby. 

He’s never shown any signs of aggression. Like stated above he even lets our toddlers pull on him and push him around.  

He’s crate trained and lays in there when he wants to be alone. 

Today I watched as our kitten pawed at him when Baxter was in his crate. He paid the cat no mind. Even when the cat jumped up on top of his crate and tried to paw at him again Baxter just laid there. 

Jump to tonight. I had just taken Baxter outside for his nighttime potty. We were sitting in the living room and instead of going back to his crate he walked right over to the cat and lunged. 

No signs of aggression before, no snarling, no growling. But it clearly wasn’t okay. I’m at a loss. No one was hurt because I got in the middle and diffused the situation. But God forbid one of the toddlers be in the middle of that.

dogs,Advice on owning an aggressive dog in apartment building ,"I’ve never been on Reddit before but I’m desperate for advice. Has anyone dealt with a human aggressive dog? I’m a 24 year old female living in a studio apartment in Los Angeles. About 6 months ago I rescued a 50lb Shepard husky mix. The rescue told me he was friendly and ready to be with a FAMILY. However, 6 months later and I’m now dealing with a very aggressive dog. It’s odd though because he gets aggressive if people are in my apartment or car. If we are outside walking he doesn’t bark, growl or pay any mind to other humans OR DOGS. If I am stopped or sitting at a table outside and someone approaches, he will lunge and growl. He lunges at people walking in the apartment building. What’s weird is if we are outside and another person has a dog, he has NO issue with the human. He loves on the human.
I’ve done group training classes and recently had my first one on one session with an amazing trainer. It was so intense that my dog ripped off both dew claws from trying to get his muzzle off. To be clear I do my ABSOLUTE best for this dog. I know his triggers so I’m very cautious of entering/exiting the building. I feel so exhausted and desperate for advice. I love this dog so much.

dogs,I love my dog and I just wanted to share  ,"My dog showed up in our lives by chance. One day my mom called and said her and my brother were getting a dog. I was over the moon. Crying. Excited. This was a lifelong dream of mine. My husband and I had talked about getting a dog, but weren’t quite ready, so I was ecstatic when my mom said she was getting one with my brother. 
Within 3 days, they quickly realized it was a lot of work and they wouldn’t be able to handle it. She was now talking about re-homing him to someone we knew. I was devastated. I know this sounds bad, but I cried harder and was more shattered than when I found out my dad died. I don’t know what it was about this little guy, in 3 short days I had developed such a deep love for him. 
My husband couldn’t stand to see me so broken, I was crying all day and couldn’t eat. Something about the thought of giving him away made my heart feel like it was being ripped out of my chest. 
So we took him. 
That was in March, and now I’m typing this as our little 10 month old guy is snoring (like he’s worked over time all week) in between my husband and I. Puppy phase was the craziest ride of my life, some days I didn’t know how I’d get through it but man, does he make life worth living. Before him, I felt like life had no meaning, no purpose, just mundane day to day shit. Now, with him around, the mundane is wonderful. He is the best. He is sweet, silly, crazy, cuddly, stubborn, playful, protective, and smart as heck. Some days we look at him and wonder who he is. His green eyes are human-like and some days I just stare at him and cry in gratitude.  He is such a special boy and I can’t imagine a day without him. He is 3/4 beagle, 1/4 mini Australian Shepard, and 100% amazing/menace. To all of you dog lovers and dog owners, how lucky are we? Hug your pups extra tight tonight.

dogs,Help! We're cat people doing an emergency dog-sit for family and this dog is apparently not house trained????,"Seriously, looking for help or suggestions.

My BF and I are very much cat people. We have three cats. Neither of us *mind* dogs, dogs are fine, but dogs are not pets that we would seek out for ourselves or our home. However, due to an emergency situation (unexpected family death, their owner has to travel for funeral, etc) we are now dog-sitting for at least a week.  The dog has been in the house for an entire thirty minutes so far and has already peed twice (once on linoleum and once on carpet) and chased the cats into hiding. Bf took it for a walk, I'm calming the cats down and querying Reddit.

Dog in question belongs to someone in BF's family. She's not a puppy but is still a younger, VERY high-energy pittbull mix. Super sweet, very loving, but so. Much. Energy. Dog's owner supposedly was taking them to obedience school, but possibly has given up? Or just never reinforced what they were teaching? Idk but the dog is clearly not housebroken despite having been adopted A YEAR AGO. Bf's dad dropped her off with a dog bed, some wee pads, and an upfront offer to COME BY WHEN THEY'RE BACK IN TOWN TO DEEP CLEAN THE CARPETS.

dogs,Mixed Feelings about New Puppy…,"Just for context, I will not be giving up the puppy. She’s mine forever now. It’s more about expectations I had. 

I recently adopted a puppy from the shelter. I am firm in believing about adopting, I don’t even consider breeders as I have never wanted to bring a creature into the world where there are already so many that need homes. I have had success adopting dogs. I adopted one puppy who was a stray 8 years ago and he is my soul dog. He’s seriously amazing. In 2019 I adopted a dog who was a year old. She was a bit more of a challenge as she was feral for 9 months. So she had a lot more behavioral issues that I had to work on, but she was an amazing dog. Both dogs are big dogs. My first, J, is 92 lbs. Bennie, was 85 and muscular (pitbull mix). I took these dogs everywhere with me, we’ve been backpacking, paddle boarding all over the US. They were my dog pack.. In July, Bennie suddenly passed away. She was only 5. 

I have been missing her and her crazy energy so much lately. My partner and I talked and we decided to get a puppy. As they are (in my opinion) easier to train and blank slates. I searched on petfinder and found a pup that I really liked. When I went to the shelter he had already been adopted, so I felt obligated to get his litter mate. There’s nothing wrong with this dog. She’s very sweet and funny to watch. But I have a feeling she’s some sort of terrier by her ears and her body shape. I have a love for larger dogs. And I think I’m just putting too many expectations on her to be like Ben or like what I’m used to. I know when you adopt a dog you have no idea what they are going to be, and I know eventually I’ll love her, but right now I’m just having a hard time because I miss and wanted my big adventure dog. Does anyone have any advice on terriers? I’m thinking she’s a rat/jack Russell lol

dogs,Bernese Mountain Dog bullying?,"Aggression/Bullying?

I have a seven month old Bernese mountain dog. For context I’ve owned many breeds in the past, hounds, an Akita, and on. I currently have a two year old Great Dane. My friend has a Berner who is awesome and I really thought the breed would be a good fit. Again I’ve owned and trained a variety of dogs.
The Dane LOVED having the Berner puppy, playing with him watching him etc the Dane is a ball of butter. He’s very submissive and gentle, gets along with my mother’s dogs etc.
Well recently since the Berner turned 7 months he’s begun bullying the Dane. I have older dogs and so does my mother—he doesn’t do it with them. I wouldn’t worry about them establishing a pecking order, but the Berner growls at the Dane over toys (unclaimed etc) and if there’s no toys to do it with he kicks the Dane off his bed etc. sometimes he’ll grab a toy and walk purposely up to the Dane then snarl.
Obviously I redirect and work with it, but the Danes feelings are hurt and the Berner will pull it the moment I turn my back. 
Honestly this is behavior I totally would expect out of a ‘dominant’ breed like the Akita or even a Ridge back or Italian Mastiff. But it shocks me out of a Berner. Is this a ‘thing’ with them that passes as they grow? Or is this just his personality that I’m dealing with? I’ve never met a Berner that sneakily aggressive it really surprised me.

It’s at the point where we can’t possibly have anyone help with walks as she’s rather strong.

dogs,[Breeds]  Planning to go through breeder or breed-specific rescue for the first time.  Recommendations needed!,"



* Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
   * Not a first dog. Currently have a small pit-heavy terrier mix, 7mo old. Took in after family member adopted as rebound dog and could not handle the puppy stage.  Recently had to say goodbye to a senior Boxer (adopted at 6mo).  Also adopted a teenager from a bad housing situation and had to make the decision to euthanize after she displayed sporadic, unpredicatable dog reactivity, with a violent attack and lack of bite inhibition.  This particular dog showed no signs of reactivity initially, was trained properly in the time we had her, but developed these issues with social maturity. Have done extensive training with all dogs, including some agility work with the Boxer. This recommendation request is to aid with long-term planning, will not get another dog until our current mix reaches social maturity, finishes basic and intermediate obedience training, and ideally receives AKC Good Citizen certification.  We just aren't a single dog household and want to prepare accordingly.
* Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
   * Leaning towards going through a respectable breeder or breed-specific rescue.  Our experience with a teenage, mixed breed dog that showed a propensity for severe reactivity (either due to genetics or lack of socialization), despite best practices in terms of ownership and training, has led us to be more wary of adoption.
* Describe your ideal dog.
   * Playful and high energy when appropriate but able to calm down and relax after exercise and mental stimulation.  Open to new experiences.  Trainable, but doesn't have to be completely pliable or ""easy mode"".  Friendly with family, friends and other pets when introduced properly.  Able to approach new situation with excitement or indifference, not caution or shyness.  Suited to going places socially, both indoors and outdoors.  Not prone to major health issues.
* What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
   * Open to all breeds within the stated parameters.
* What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
   * Sit, stay, down, come, off and leave it are all non-negotiable, along with loose-leash walking.  How to greet calmly and behave in crowded settings.  Everything else is gravy, have enjoyed training beyond these sorts of basic obedience in the past, and will do so with our current young dog.
* Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
   * Will not be a working dog, but would love to get into a sport, non-competitively.  Have done some agility in the past.  Am looking into scentwork for our current young dog, she seems like she would be well-suited to it.   While not a sport per se, we love hiking with our dogs.  Open to low cost and low barrier to entry sports and activities.
* How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
   * Several hours daily.  We spend a lot of time with our dogs.  Much of it relaxing but also plenty of outdoor and play time.
* How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
   * Varies greatly. At minimum a short ""formal"" walk in which the dog is asked to be alert and respond to commands and paying attention, in addition to an intentional and busy outdoor play session.  Other days may include long walks and hikes, swimming and running, or long interactions in public with emphasis on proper ettiquete and expectation that the dog will ""be on"".  Absolutely no dog parks, we are not fans.
* How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
   * Minimal grooming at home.  Willing to pay a professional.  Very wet winters where we live and don't want to deal with dogs that are very difficult when wet.
* 10. What size dog are you looking for?
   * 25-65lbs
* How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
   * Minimal shedding.  Barking is fine.  Slobber is fine as long as it's not extreme.
* How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
   * We reserve off-leash activity for when we are in large natural spaces fairly far removed from other people and pets.  But recall in these situations is fairly important.
* Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
   * Snuggly
* Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
   * Something in the middle. We're used to stubborn dogs and don't mind some ""personality"", within reason.
* How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
   * Barking when someone comes into the yard or knocks on the door. Calming down and greeting in a friendly manner once we confirm through tone and body language that the visitor is friendly.
* Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
   * Within reason but not ideal. Our Boxer did fine with other dogs once she knew them but was generally suspicious of strange dogs and tended to bark but didn't display any serious aggression.  We socialized extensively when she was young, but she was never an amazing dog with other dogs. We were fine managing this behavior for 12 years.  Just knew to cross the street on a walk, distract with voice and treats, etc, and to be careful when introducing to dogs of family and friends.   We had the terrible experience I mentioned earlier when we adopted a teenage dog that developed severe and unpredictable dog aggression.   Our young terrier mix is so far highly submissive to other dogs and we are socializing heavily, but we recognize some of her lineage has a propensity for dog reactivity and are prepared for it.
* Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
   * Absolutely has to be tolerant of children and cats.
* How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
   * Maximum of 6 hours, although this is definitely not a daily occurence.
* What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
   * Spouse and I are on the same page with our preferences. I am the one more inclined to do the training, but the dog must be willing to follow commands from the other members in the family. Child has grown up around dogs and knows how to interact with them, but is still a kid.
* Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
   * As mentioned, a 7mo dog who will be 1.5-2yo by the time we bring another dog into the home.   We have two cats, one loves dogs and plays with them like a puppy.  The other makes it clear he does not like dogs, but will not provoke them and attempts to avoid when possible.
* Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
   * Yes, 7yo child and his friends.
* Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
   * No, we own our home. Large fenced yard.
* What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
   * Rural Pacific Northwest, USA.  Not aware of any breed regulations.
* What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
   * Average Summer day is 80ish fahrenheit and dry, average winter day is 45ish fahrenheit and wet.
* Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
   * This post is for long-term planning purposes, and because we are consider a breeder or breed specific rescue.  We have never purchased a dog from a breeder but have come to appreciate the role responsible breeders play in temperament and health of dogs.   We are fine with less common breeds, as we intend to take plenty of time to research over the next year or so.  If breed-specific rescues are a suggestion, any advice on how to mitigate the risk of genetic abnormalities and potential behavioral issues would be welcome.   Thanks so much!

dogs,"10.5 month old mini Poodle is still mouthing, sometimes hard","I've had this dog since she was 10 weeks old. She's always been mouthy. For the first few weeks she did respond to reverse time outs and yelping for bite inhibition. But eventually she stopped caring about these things and the behaviour hasn't reduced at all.

She is constantly trying to nip hands and feet. Sometimes I can get her to stop nipping my hands by making a firm first so it is uncomfortable to bite. But there is nothing I can do about my feet and ankles.

She doesn't care about toys when I try to redirect her. She doesn't care about being rewarded when she stops. She doesn't care if I yelp, regardless of the pitch/volume. She doesn't care if I leave the room. She doesn't care if I ignore her and stop moving. All she wants to do is nip my feet and ankles and will not stop unless I'm actively pulling her away.

No amount of training is working. The groomer complained about the mouthing as well - it is a safety risk for both parties. Generally she doesn't nip hard, but it is noticeable and uncomfortable/annoying. Last night she did suddenly nip me harder after I attempted to ignore her nipping for about 30 seconds. It HURT and it almost broke skin.

dogs,[Breeds] Starting the search for a new companion after saying goodbye to my 17yo schnoodle,"\*\*Introduction\*\*

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* No. I have had dogs my entire life, literally since I was born, with the current 5ish months since my 17yo dog's passing being the longest I have gone without a dog. I was a kid when my family got most of our dogs, so I wasn't responsible for training them, but I did train my late 17yo boy and also helped with some training for a few other dogs. I'm admittedly likely a bit rusty with training a dog since my boy was an old guy when he passed, and so it's been a bit of time since I've had to actively train a dog.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

\* I am looking to rescue, but am thinking I may need to look at breed-specific rescues.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

\* I live in an apartment, so a dog suitable for apartment living is a must – not a ton of barking, not super super high energy. But aside from that, I'm really not picky, I love discovering dogs' individual personalities. I'd prefer an affectionate dog and one that is probably a bit lower or medium energy. I'm a homebody and a pretty laid back person, so would prefer a dog with a similar attitude, but one who is also up for the occasional adventure.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* I'm really interested in any and all breeds. I'm a life-long dog person and have had German Shepherds, English Springer Spaniesl, Brittany Spaniels, and schnoodles in my life. We're thinking that since we live in an apartment, a smaller or medium sized breed would be best, though.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Normal commands (sit, stay, lay, etc.)

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No. Just want a companion.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* I work from home, and my job is pretty laid back, so I can commit several hours a day and work on training, playing, etc. throughout the day.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* I am able to go on several shorter walks in the morning and during the day (around 15-20 minutes) and take them to my apartment's dog park in the evenings.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* Can do daily brushings. Did bi-monthly groomings (typically every 6-8 weeks) with my schnoodle, but also learned to start grooming him at home as he got older. Thinking that I would maybe prefer a pup that doesn't require quite as frequent groomings as my schnoodle did, but again, not opposed to it and am able to afford it.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)What size dog are you looking for?

\* While I would love a large dog, I think my current living arrangements are best suited for a small or medium sized dog.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* I'd prefer to keep shedding to a minimum, the quieter the better (live in an apartment, so have to be mindful of neighbors..but also ware that all dogs bark and make noise), and would prefer not a ton of slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Not at all important. I prefer to keep my dog leashed when in unfenced areas.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* I'm good with either, but would prefer one who likes affection.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* Again, not very picky. I've had experiences with both types of personalities, and have loved both.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* I'd prefer if they didn't bark with knocks on the door (again, live in an apartment). I don't mind if they get excited when greeting strangers and visitors, though I would hope to train them not to jump.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* I live in an apartment where there are many other dogs, so aggression towards other dogs isn't something I can have at the moment.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Not that I can think of. Really just want to avoid an agressive dog. Since we have a cat, we'd likely want a breed with a low prey drive as well.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* Rarely. I work from home, so they would have someone at home throughout the week. The only time they would be left alone would be for short periods of time on the weekends (probably like 2-3 hours at most).

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* ""hypoallergenic,"" (to whatever extent that's possible), but really just breeds with less shedding and pet dander, as my partner is mildly allergic, but willing to get allergy shots. They will be involved in daily care and training, but since I work from home, I would take on the bulk of the responsibility.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* We have a kitten. She was fostered in a home with dogs, so she spent the first few months of her life around dogs. She is the only other animal and is not at all shy Pretty sure she'd warm up to having a dog in the house pretty quickly. She's extremely rambunctious. We don't plant to get any more animals within the next few years after getting a dog.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No. The only time they would interact with children is when I go to visit my sister and her family (children ranging in age from 3-8) during holidays.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* We rent and will be renting for the next few years. Weight restriction is 80 pounds, breed restrictions are as follows (an include mixes with these breeds): pitbull, rottweiler, doberman, chow chow, great dane, akita, staffordshire bull terrier, american pitbull terrier, husky, Saint Bernard, shar pei, German shepherd, and Alaskan malamute. Generalized ""terrier mix"" and ""shepherd mix"" breeds should be avoided, we were just told.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* I live in TN, USA.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summers are hot, typically ranging from 80s to high 90s. Winters are typically mild in the mid-30s and 40s, with some days below freezing. We will be moving to New York within the next year or two, so we will have milder summers but more extreme winters once we move.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* Again, just want to stress that I currently live in an apartment, so I am attempting to get an idea of some breeds that may generally be better suited for apartment life. ",1730295744.0

He is a verryyyy lazy dog and while he does get walked usually 3 times a day for about 10-15 minutes each walk, he really isn't much more active than that. He's a big couch potato, so I'm concerned this food amount will end up being too much.

dogs,My dog had a scary dream 😭 and I asked if she was a skin walker (real skin walker story here so scary),"So this is somewhat funny but also I felt REALLY bad for her in the moment. So I was asleep and I heard my dog whining and so I thought she was locked in the room and couldn't get out but had to potty so I opened the door a bit more and got back into bed and closed my eyes but she kept whining and so I ignored her. After a minute of her whining and me calling her name(to get her to shut up or get on my bed) I figured she wanted on my bed but had failed to get up cause she's a small dog so I was finally like fuck it fine help you get up so I went to the edge of my bed and called for her but she didn't come so I raised my voice a bit and put on a firm tone and then she came to me but it wasn't from the edge of my bed it was from the top underneath of my bed and when she was in my hands I felt that she was shaking like a lot so I was like tf r u okay and I turned the lights on and the only way I could describe it was that she looked pale. Her ears were all the way back and she had these scared puppy dog eyes and so I picked her up and we hung out for a few minutes and I cuddled her. After a few seconds she was honestly fine but I just felt like she needed a bit of attention and comforting. I had this thought deep in my mind(i know it's silly) that maybe a skin walker ate her underneath my bed and that it wasn't my doggo anymore so I started having her do tricks that she didn't know. I had her do paw (which I taughter her but she wouldn't ever do it unless I was really mean and made her) and she did it so quickly I thought it was odd. So then I started trying to have her do one I KNEW she didn't know which was roll over and ofc she didn't do it cause she dosent know the damn trick. So I was like whatever and let it go kinda just making SURE she wasnt eaten by a skin walker and abt 20 minutes after I looker at he and said ""it's okay Bella I know you had a really bad dream you're okay now. Or you got eaten by a skinwalker"" and then she perked up her ears at the word skin walker and so I said it again and was like wth 💀 and after a minute of just repeating it I said it slowly, ""skin"" then ""walker"" and she perked up her ears at walker, she thought that for WHATEVER reason I was telling her we were gonna go on a walk lmao so yeah that's my odd ass dog story for today hope you enjoyed my Ted talk",1730269440.0

He keeps ripping up his paw pads from playing fetch in our yard. Our yard is currently dirt. We are planning to get grass in spring. We have mushers secret and just started using it again because he is getting cracked paw pads again, but I'm not sure if it is really enough. 

Do you reccomend shoes or booties? What kind? Or is there a better cream/balm i could be using? Help me keep his paws healthy!!!",1730238022.0
dogs,What crossbreed it is?,"Tuesday I finished early from my work. When I was coming home I was about to almost run over a little dog but luckily I braked really fast enough to avoid an accident. There were a lot of cars on this road, so I decided to take this puppy to keep it safe. Now i decided to adopt her. It's female, i love it so much. What kind of crossbreed could be? From the photos I don't know if you see how small it is. The veterinary doctor and my friends assume it is crossbreed with a beagle.

dogs,Dog toy recommendations needed,"First time poster here,

This is the first time I'm at a loss of ideas for chew toys for my dog. She's only 11 months and she's gone through about every single chew toy, yes even the black Kong toys. She had a black Kong bone that she started to destroy and eat. She currently has a toy that she loves because of the squeaker in it. So I'm asking if anyone knows a company i can order chew toys that have a squeaker or just a toy in general for my dog that she can't destroy and eat the peices of.

dogs,"Visiting a Shelter to Meet Dogs This Saturday, What Should We Look Out For?","My partner and I are going to an animal shelter this weekend to get a feel for different dog personalities, although we’re leaning toward getting a cat as our first pet & we could change our final decision (we visited a cat café last weekend and loved it!).

dogs,My dog is terrified of ear medication and I feel so guilty. Any tips or guidance?,"Got my rescue pup around three years ago (\~5.5 years old, 17lbs, chihuahua mix (possibly w/ dachshund?)), and she is petrified of getting ear drops (this medication is in a syringe, so it's just one ""push"" per ear)

She won't be distracted by high value treats, lick mats, etc. during these moments. Even vets and vet techs have been shocked at how scared she gets and how hard she fights back (never to hurt, just to get away). She was once given calming medicine to get an ultrasound and had to be sedated twice because her anxiety was so high she just fought through it the first time.

The vet recommended my boyfriend hold her and I do the syringe, but she's secretly a tank and wrestles out of the hold every time. We sing, baby talk, give scritches, hold treats, spread cheese/PB on a mat, the whole nine yards -- and she is hyper-focused on running away and ended up ass-up in my boyfriends arms and scratched his neck with her hind legs. Last night, after half an hour trying to get the medication in, she pooped a little bit while trying to run away (which she has never, ever done out of fear before) and I broke down crying and couldn't do it anymore, I felt so bad. My boyfriend tried to sneakily put them in while she was dozing off later and she must have smelled it, because she woke up and squirmed away. 

I feel absolutely *horrendous* for making her so scared. I feel like I'm retraumatizing her and am kicking myself for being such a terrible owner. And I know the best thing is to make her happy and do it while she's distracted or otherwise, but none of the distracting methods have worked because even when we've desensitized her to us touching her ears, she's SO hyperaware of what we're doing when it comes down to medication time. It's like she has a sixth sense for it when we hide it behind our backs, up our sleeves, pre-placed under a blanket near her basking spots, etc. 

**My question is: How do y'all do ear medication with super anxious dogs??**


Update: Thank you all SO much for your responses!! They’ve all been so genuinely helpful and I’m relieved to have some tips I can employ later as well, once we get through this course of meds and can get her desensitized to the syringe more in general. Thank you all again so so much!! I really, truly appreciate it.",1730227319.0
dogs,"Mini Schnauzer, Border Terrier, or other? Looking to add a sidekick to my family!","Hi all, thanks in advance for your input and advice!

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* No, I’ve raised two dogs, and often watch my friends’ and family’s dogs. (Maltipoo to Doberman to Doodles)

I adopted a 2yo purebred Jack Russell 3 years ago however, and cared for her for 10 months but realized we were not a mutual fit due to her intense hatred of other dogs (my family nicknamed her Mike Tyson after she tried to bite my cousin’s dog in the ear). She had been raised by an elderly couple inside of an RV during covid, so she had no social skills and rarely was exercised unfortunately. She was super dog-aggressive and anxious. I took her to professional training twice a week and had to walk her 5-8 times a day to get her energy out, along with runs and playtime. The aggression was what made me realize it wouldn’t work out, as I live in a city and I think she needed to be on a farm. Rehomed her after this, and she is doing better! 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

\* Would love to rescue, but my needs are pretty specific, listed below

3) Describe your ideal dog.

\* Looking for an active small sidekick! I’d love a dog that is ok living in an apartment with me, but going on daily walks and the energy to go on long hikes, backpacking, and traveling on weekends. I want a smart dog that I can teach tricks, but not a lunatic like my Jack Russell. Needs to get along with other dogs well (will socialize the dog and train him/her young!). Also, my girlfriend has allergies to dogs, so looking for a dog that doesn’t shed too much. I also would like to be able to occasionally take the dog in the plane for short trips (not a dealbreaker, but nice to have). Another nice to have would be to have a dog that can learn decently reliable recall, I’d love to be able to take the dog off leash in safe areas so they can follow on a hike or do their thing

To sum up:

* Active, able to keep up on hikes and runs (when an adult) and go reasonable distances. 
* Low allergy risk for my gf
* Small enough to take anywhere
* Friendly with other dogs and people with socialization
* Not a crazy barker, although I am willing to train that if necessary
* Recall is possible through training

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* I’ve narrowed it down in my research to border terriers, it seems they are pretty stout little guys and switch between apartment living and long hikes. They are also pretty good with humans and other dogs. I’ve looked at mini schnauzers as well and mini poodles, but am worried about barking for schnauzers and energy for poodles. Little worried about recall with Border terrier, seems like they require quite a bit of training for good recall, which I would be able to do. Let me know if i’m totally off or missed anything!

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Tricks would be fun but most importantly a good recall, basic commands (sit, down, leave it, stay, etc), and good leash manners.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* I would be open to doing a sport if it helped the dog gain confidence. But it would be less about winning and more for training/confidence for the pup

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* Happy to do 1-1.5 hours of walking/running + active games/training a day. Otherwise I work from home so happy to do 4-6 short walks. Understandably more time for a puppy.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

\* 1-1.5 hours. Walking, fetch, hide and seek, hiding treats, etc. Yes there are a few dog parks near me, I’d love to take her to meet up with dog friends to play. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* I can do 5-10 mins a day or take them to a groomer when necessary. Happy to cut nails and bathe the dog too.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10) What size dog are you looking for?

\* Small, would be nice if they could fit in a small crate to go on the plane in the cabin from time to time, but not a dealbreaker.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* My gf is allergic to dogs (manageable with medication + less dander/shedding), so the less the better. I live in an apartment so a small amount of barking is ok, but ideally I can train them to bark less or when it’s reasonable.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Fairly important, it would be nice if I could train a consistent recall for going hiking or emergency situations

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Definitely a dog that likes to snuggle. Ok if they’re sometimes aloof but definitely prefer a sidekick that wants to snuggle and receive some love!

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* Eager to please 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

\* A bark is ok, but not uncontrollable barking. I’d prefer them not to jump (happy to train this), and learn to be patient and sit until the person comes to them. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* No, I’ve dealt with this before and I want a dog that can get along with other dogs. Ok if the dog is defensive where appropriate.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Just dog/people aggression and also don’t want a dog that is afraid of everything

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* I work remotely, but would like to be able to leave an adult dog alone occasionally for 4-5 hours when necessary.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

\* My gf will help care for and walk the dog, but I will be the main caretaker. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* No current pets

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* I rent but there are no restrictions on dogs. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* USA, N/A

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summers in 80-90ºF and winters of 40-50ºF

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * A younger dog so that I can introduce them to my 4 cats. A dog with a bark that does not have a pitch that will exacerbate my husband's headache sensitivity.

    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * 
    1: Know the phrase ""GIT-TH'CAT"" to stop my cat Pancake from clawing furniture. Angelo/Emily would not chase their respective cats, just huff and ""step up"" to startle them away from the furniture.
    2: Ringing The Bell - my sister taught her dog to ring a bell at the front door to let her know when he needs to go out and pee/poo. I'd like to train my dog to do that.

I like ""having conversations"" with my dogs, and I got a siamese cat specifically because they're ""chatty.""

    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * No, I've owned 3 pitbulls, a husky and 2 chihuahuas- all rescues. I really miss my one dog who loved training- everything from obedience, to scent games, really simple coursing, to basic therapy (cuddle on command).
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    My most recent pitbull had a working dog spirit, high intelligence, combined with extreme affection. If I can find that in a rescue I'm OK with that, but would consider a breeder, especially for decreased risks of health problems.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    High trainability/intelligence, medium energy level, loves obedience training, extremely affectionate, eager to please. Good with people and other dogs. 40-80 lbs. Low maintenance coat
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    I'm fine with finding a pitbull again, but it's just so hard finding what I'm looking for in rescues. It seems really hard to find an ethical pitbull breeder. I'm considering German Shepherds for their trainability but I'm concerned about their health and somewhat their shedding. I'm considering a Dutch Shepherd for trainability but would be looking for as low energy as possible, relative to their breed.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    Basic and advanced obedience, Canine Good Citizen, scent games if they enjoy it. If I found the right dog, training it to provide assistance for emotional distress.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    No, just a stellar companion dog.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    6 hours
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    About an hour per day, it would be combined obedience/informal agility or fetch/walks or runs. No dog parks.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * Open to it all but would prefer low shedding. My husky was crazy upkeep, and I prefer not to deal with that if I can help it.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    40-80lbs
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    Medium shedding or less, barking is fine as long as hearing protection isn't required, some slobber is ok.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    This would be great, I've never had a dog with recall strong enough to trust doing it.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    Extreme snuggler
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    Very eager to please
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    Barking is fine, aggression is undesired. Should be capable of meeting new people without aggression.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    Yeah, but I'd much prefer a dog capable of being around other dogs.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    Strong people reactivity/aggression. Bad separation anxiety. 
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    I hybrid work, when my wife and I are gone, it would be about 8 hours. I can come home on my lunch break on some days.

    I've never had a dog from a breeder, I can't tell if it's a route we should go, advice requested on adopt vs ethical breeder?
    
    I met the most amazing dutch shepherd, calm but alert, extremely intelligent, good with strangers- good size with a managable coat. I'm wondering, was he just a fluke or can a similar one, toned down enough to be a companion/pet be found?

dogs,Will a horse randomly attack a dog it doesn’t know? Unsure which flair to use as well.,"Hey, so I moved into a small ranch to help take care of it while the owner is gone. She has a horse, a very big mare, two dogs, a chicken, multiple cats, etc. 

Anyway, she likes to follow my dog around everywhere while I’m walking her on a leash. It makes both me and my dog uncomfortable and I’m scared the horse will try to kick her. So I’ve been having to keep her inside more than I usually would and I’m trying to decide whether it’s safe or not.

My dog doesn’t know how to behave around horses, but she at least doesn’t chase them. The owner said that the horse may kick my dog if threatened, but the problem is that I’m not close with said horse. I don’t know how to properly handle the situation and get them used enough to each other that I can take my dog on walks without having to limit the horse to its pasture.",1730140519.0
dogs,How do you figure out what a dog likes to do for fun?,"My dog (some kind of hound, probably 1 year old) keeps play-bowing at me, but I haven't found any kind of game he likes to play. He doesn't do fetch, he doesn't chase toys, he doesn't seem to comprehend tug of war. If I leave him alone he'll pick up his soft toys (or my socks) and carry them around a bit, but again, he doesn't chase those if I throw them, although he'll surrender them willingly enough if I ask for the socks back. 

I'm in an apartment and have limited space to let him run around. There's a fenced area I can take him to so he can run around off leash, but he mostly doesn't actually bother to run? He'll run with me on a leash sometimes, but he doesn't reliably chase when we're in the fenced area.

I'm just worried that he's bored. The other problem is that he likes me a lot more than he likes toys. He would always prefer that I just pet him rather than play with a toy. We're doing basic training, and he's pretty good at it, although cue discrimination is a little rough right now. I know he's a pretty smart dog, I just want to make sure he gets some activity!

So basically, my question is just how do you figure out what a dog likes to do? And/or how do you teach games?

Update: Wow, thanks y'all! I'm going to look at scent games for him, that does sound promising. I've tried taking him to the little dog park here several times, but there's not been another dog when I've done that so I don't yet know how he does with other dogs yet. Once I get that figured out and am confident about his recall and responsiveness when around strange dogs, I'll look at options for agility or barn hunt or something. This is all great stuff!

dogs,"Help Narrow Down Or offer alternatives: Golden Retriever/Doodle, Aussie, Shih Poo ","Hello, we recently moved into our new home and are looking to narrow down our dog search. We both absolutely love dogs, and would like to get one next year. We are having a hard time narrowing down or figuring out what might fit our lifestyle. We are both in our early 30’s with experience with dogs in the past. We both absolutely adore golden retrievers but are unsure if they would be too big for us. We often like to camp in a roof top tent and are trying to figure out sleeping arrangements with a dog. There is not enough room for a large dog, but room for a small/medium size. We easily could make a full dog bed inside the back of our SUV and either let him sleep by himself there or one of us could sleep with him. (We car camped for a year or two and this would be no problem) Or a small/medium dog could fit up with us in the tent. We go camping maybe half a dozen times a year.

3. If you adopted a dog from an owner who couldn’t take care of them anymore—maybe the owner was elderly, very ill, or passed away—you’re the one who brought them happiness again after losing someone deeply important to them.



4. If you took in a stray, you’re the one who turned their whole world around. One day, they were on their own, and the next, they had you as family. To them, you’re a life-changing miracle.



5. If your dog came from a tough or traumatic situation—whether they faced owners that ignored their needs, violent owners, or something unexpected like surviving a fire or terrible accident—you’re the person who finally showed them safety and comfort. You’re not just home to them; you’re the reason they believe good things can still happen.



6. If you adopted a dog with unique challenges—maybe they have a disability, an illness, or they were deeply scared at first—you’re the one who helps them realize they’re not only lovable but also perfect in your eyes, just as they are.

I'd prefer shelter/rescue, but not adverse to breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Small (not teacup) to medium (I live upstairs and have a fear of falling down the stairs if the dog is too big and yanks me). It will need to deal well with other animals and children. Intelligent, likes to cuddle, not a frequent barker, easily trainable, short to medium hair. Not high energy. Average lifespan of at least 10 years. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Some sort of terrier or a King Charles Spaniel (a family member has one so somewhat familar with the breed) seems to be popping up again and again in other dog breed quizzes, so I guess those? I'm not interested in dogs like pugs who have breathing problems as part of their breed creation. I don't really have any particular preference, breed wise. I'm more concerned about size and temperament.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Fetch, stop, lay down, wait, signal needs to go to the bathroom. Basically, don't have a crazy unruly dog running around.

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No.

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I'm home full time.

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

30-60, plus indoor play. I hadn't really thought of what sorts of exercise. Just indoor play of different varieties to get any extra energy out. I'd take them to a dog park occasionally.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

A couple of times a week would be fine. I'd like to try grooming at home first and if that doesn't work then I'll do professional.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Small or medium.

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Not a lot of shedding, not a yippy dog, and minimum slobber. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

I'd keep them on a leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

More of a snuggler.

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

More eager to please, but independent as well.

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Wary but not aggressive to knocking, welcoming to strangers/visitors.

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Yippy and aggressive are the only things I can think of.

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

At most 20 hours out of the whole week.

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

I live alone.

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I plan on getting a kitten/cat within a year of getting the dog. 


21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I rent. 50lbs max. No aggressive breeds.

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in Houston. Potentially some aggressive breeds, but not sure.

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

It's between 75-100 the majority of the year (spring/summer/fall), not including humidity. Winter is only 1-2 months and usually goes into the 30's for the low. Houston weather is bipolar, so even in winter it'll be in the 40's one day and 70's the next.

dogs,Pretty sure my dog refused to play with a doll because he mistook it for a real human,"My dog loves to shred/disembowel/dismember stuffed animals.  I have a Joe Exotic costume this year for halloween, but because I'm a lady people assumed I'm dressed as Carole Baskin.  I decided to just roll with it and decided a good addition to my costume would be a ""husband"" that I fed to tigers (ex. a dismembered doll stuffed inside of a tiger purse). I got a doll (think American girl doll) from the thrift store and decided I could have it mauled and dismembered by a ferocious beast (my dog of course).

When I give the doll to my dog, he just kinda looks at it and goes ""meh"".  I figured he probably didn't recognize it as a toy.  So I tried to shake it around, make it exciting, etc. He was interested and  started to play, but then stopped, sniffed over the doll, looked really uncomfortable and just sat off to the side and gave me weird side-eye.  My boyfriend pointed out ""um, he thinks that's a real person"" and I think he was right. The more I tried to get my dog to play, the more he was sniffing and nudging at the doll's face and hands until he gave me this look of ""nah mom, I ain't about this, you're on your own"" and sat in a corner.  It wasn't unit I snipped into the doll with scissors and showed him it was made out of stuffing that he started playing with it, then happily mauled it like the ferocious toy-destroying monster he is.

On a completely unrelated note: my dog asks me for permission before shredding up a toy.  It's really cute.  He'll bring it to me and drop it on the floor and just stare at me.  If I say ""go ahead"", the massacre will commence; if I say ""sorry buddy, that's not yours"" he'll leave it alone even when unsupervised.

dogs,What dog breed do you think fits best?,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I have a 3 year old Miniature Poodle. I trained her with the intention for her to become a service dog for scent alerts however she began barking at seemingly random times in public (due to pain) so she washed. I am very interested in dog behaviour and clicker training so she has a lot of great training and skills. I have taught at the local puppy school and completed lots of online courses. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I want to go through a reputable breeder. I thought I had gotten my last dog from a reputable breeder but have since discovered I did not.  

3) Describe your ideal dog.

Companion dog, and hobby dog sports. I want a dog that I can do a lot of stuff with. I invest a lot of time in training and get a lot of joy from it so it is important that the dog also enjoys training. When not actively engaged I would like it to be able to settle by itself. I want to be able to take the dog pretty much anywhere in public without it reacting to things, I understand the training needed but genetically they need to be able to achieve this. I like to cuddle at night on the couch and in bed, but I do not want the dog to constantly need to be on top of me. 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Miniature poodle, working cocker spaniels, working springer spaniels, Brittanys. I like their biddability and look. However I'm open to hearing about any breeds you think could meet my criteria. I am happy to have a high energy dog, but very open to a lower energy breed. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I would like a dog who could be trained in many things, a jack of all trades ideally.  

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

I would like to continue to try novice sports but I don't intend to compete in any sports.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

About 3-4 hours of my day are devoted entirely to my dog. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

We usually do a 45-60 minute off leash walk exploring an area. A few rounds of fetch in the backyard. Then either a training session or a meal in some form of enrichment. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I'm happy to do whatever is needed.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium, no smaller than a miniature poodle. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I am not a fan of barking, but I don't expect my dog to be silent all the time. The less shedding the better but I am comfortable with some.  I can not deal with slobber. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Being able to be off leash is very important to me however I am happy to put in a lot of training to make that possible. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I like to have cuddles but it's important that they can respect people personal space.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I get a lot of joy from training, so I would like a dog who also enjoys it! 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Ideally they would bark once or twice and then sit politely if they know the person or run to tell me if its a stranger.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I do not want an aggressive dog. Excessive barking. Separation anxiety. The inability to settle. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

About 3 hours, then I come home for lunch and we play fetch and wee, then I go back to work for another 3 hours.

dogs,Why the hate on the doodle population here on reddit? Discouraging information here on /dogs but could use help in finding more information on where to start. ,"Hi all, newbie here to /dogs but an avid user here on reddit.  I have been an animal lover all my life having owned cats, dogs, fish, and even rats at one point.  My family lost our two rescue lab mixes in 2019 and 2023 respectfully.  My children being 11 and 5 were asking me for a cat but mom said no so now they are practically begging for a dog.  After much consideration and healing plus knowing that my oldest is showing his responsibility to me in meaningful ways I decided to start searching for a dog.  Wife and I are leaning towards the doodle hybrid breeds mainly because they look like mini chewbaccas and don't shed nearly as much as what we owned before.  

I seen many posts on facebook and even looked around central florida and breeders are running amok.  Everything speaks and writes for profit.  Maybe some people whom are on youtube seem a little bit more knowledgeable on the breed and more geniune.  Still when I looked up more information here on reddit, specifically the how to choose a reputable breeder.  There seems to be a lot of animosity here regarding these 'designer dogs.'  Seems like peeps want me to find a champion direct descendant of either a working showcase dog or something that competes in pagents....   I think my family just wants a quality family pet that would be good fit for my children without breaking the bank.

dogs,Dog Friendly California Adventures,"Hello All, 

I am looking for recommendation for activities and trips to do in California that are dog-friendly in a way that isn’t just “dogs are allowed here” but in a way I can get outside and hike and play with my dog in a way she can enjoy and is legal. I follow all rules and regulations with my dog, so nowhere that it isn’t fully legal for her to be there. I clean up after her, she has a bomb-proof recall and doesn’t chase wildlife. So legal off-leash areas would be welcome recommendations as well. 

She loves beaches and hikes, but is not a super high energy dog, she can do around 5 miles, but then wants to sleep the rest of the day and will not go on another long walk. Usually I hike or do other activities with her in the morning and then leave her in the hotel for late-afternoon and evening so she can get her much-loved nap, while I explore the area on my own. 

Some boundaries 

No national parks (these really aren’t dog friendly and dogs just aren’t meant to be here)

No small dog parks. She doesn’t enjoy the company of other dogs, though she tolerates them, she prefers to ignore them. 

Would prefer destinations that focus on the outdoors.

dogs,Any suggestions on teeth safe chew toys that don’t involve food?,"The only toy my dog has ever shown any interest in that wasn’t some sort of treat toy or food dispenser are nylabones. I knew they ran a risk of breaking a tooth which is why he only ever got them while supervised so I could take them away if he started chewing too hard, but I didn’t realize they could wear down teeth. If they weren’t the only toy that brought him any joy I would’ve gotten rid of them ages ago. But I also can’t give him toys filled with treats all day because he is an old man and gains weight easily. Any recommendations for alternatives? He is also terrified of toys with squeakers so that narrows my options down a lot :(",1729883861.0
dogs,How has spaying changed the character of your female dog?,"
Hello all, 

I have a working line hunting dog from a rare breed. In my country, there is only about 30-40 dogs of this breed, and mine is one of the only 4 females known to the club that could breed. Because of that, I listened to the recommendation of her breeder and the breed club not to spay her yet. My vet also recommended not to spay large dogs unter 2 years of age because of hormones associated to growth. 

Now she is a little over two years. She has had a little problem with resource guarding, but I thought with training I had succeeded at resolving it. There was one single guarding event than at her first heat, than another at her second heat, but since her third heat she seems to be back to resource guarding. 

Now I wonder if spaying would resolve this. Has someone hat a dog that was resource guarding and affected positively or negatively by spaying? Or also if your dog was never guarding at all, how did spaying affect their character?

About health risks I have already read some studies and got information from my vet about elimination of pyometra risk but increased cancer risk. So I think I am informed about that topic already. But I am curious to hear how spaying affected your dogs behavior!

Thanks all!

Edit:

- the das was trained and still is trained against guarding behavior using counter conditioning. The training proved very efficient since there was only one guarding incident until she was more than two years old - a case where she guarded a bone during her first heat. 

- however, now, at two and a half years and during/after her third heat, the behavior has reappeared

- I do not want to spay her to fix her behavior - I know that behavioral problems always require training - instead, I wonder if spaying would make the behavior worse.",1729868993.0

dogs,Looking for puzzle toys,"So my duck toller suffers from separation anxiety. She is the sweetest girl but I’ve found her panting and drooling a lot when I come home from work. I’ve read online that puzzle toys can help. I tried a snuffle matt but she is too smart she just picks up the entire matt and shakes it around so the treats fall out.

Basically looking for a puzzle or enrichment activity for her that she can’t just pick up and dump the food out. 

Google says exercise and puzzle toys help and the whole retraining being left alone.

dogs,Thoughts on my predicament.,So for the past year plus I’ve taken over care of my mom’s senior chihuahua she could not keep because of a debilitating illness.

However today I was informed corporate is cracking down and I cannot bring him anymore. I could keep him in a kennel at home and let him out a couple times a day but he would still hate it. I also have family friends who could take him full time and he would be able to live a better life than being home alone most of the day. I’m really at a loss what to do. ,1729804525.0
dogs,Need suggestions for a destructive dog,"My husband has a lab that is a little over 2 years old.  My husband is retired so they spend a fair amount of time together.

That said, he is very destructive. He ate through the cable mechanisms that open his camper shell door!!  He digs holes, he tears up things he shouldn't get a hold of (like a package of washcloths) and so much more.  He isn't even the size of a normal lab...he is quite a bit smaller.  SO much destruction in something so small!!

That said, I did do some research.  I am almost 100% confident that Miles has separation anxiety if he can't be allowed to go with my husband.  I also know that as smart as he is, he is getting bored and the destructive behavior is to alleviate this boredom.

My husband is a bit old-fashioned and just doesn't understand dog behavior.  Dogs are to be quiet and obedient.  He has gotten softer in his old age and he allows Miles to do more than his previous labs ever did.  He is what some would say, SPOILED...LOL!

I suggested to my husband that we get him some enrichment toys to help with the boredom when he has to be left for any length of time.  I am familiar with Kong brand toys and we are going to get a couple of those. (I also have a deaf land seal named Casper.  Can't leave my baby out!)

What suggestions would you recommend for something durable yet challenging?  I want something safe for him that he, hopefully, can't destroy and also be a challenge.

It all sounds suspicious especially with them all claiming we'd need to buy new crates as ours will be turned away. But I brought them into Greece in those crates and had no issues. 

I'm just so confused and feel like we're trying to be pressured into paying higher costs by multiple pet shipping companies. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. ",1729768531.0
dogs,Please help me choose my second dog. [Breeds],"
 **Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No. I’ve had an ACD mix for over a year, since she was 5 months old. I also volunteer at my local ACC weekly working with lots of different types of dogs in the play yard. I’m not an expert by any means, but I have picked up some stuff. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Nope! Either is okay with me. My current dog is from a shelter.



3) Describe your ideal dog.

* A snuggle bug, if possible. I tend to lean towards semi-velcro dogs. I do a lot of walking/hiking in the summer months, so a dog that can go several miles in a day. However, where I live it gets extremely cold in the winter, so conversely I need a dog that isn’t gonna lose its mind when we’re doing mainly indoor enrichment for 5 months out of the year. Low prey drive, as I have cats. One thing I really like about my ACD mix is how much she seems to have going on in her little head. She’s really smart and has a lot of personality. She’s also kind of sassy, which I do honestly enjoy. 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I’ve always wanted a German Shorthaired Pointer, but that’s mainly because they look really cool and I love it when they point. I don’t actually know if they fit what Im looking for. I have considered a lab because I’ve read a lot of stories in which they pair really well with ACDs. I also love bully mixes, but will admit I am fearful of bringing home one. Just because I have cats. I’ve loved all of the bully mixes i’ve worked with at the shelter, but a good majority of them could only go to cat-free homes. I also have been looking into medium-sized spaniels, selfishly based off of aesthetics alone. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Off-leash training is a big one. I do a lot of road tripping/hiking/camping. My current dog is still not to be trusted off leash on hikes, but I know I can let her off leash to potty at a rest stop, or when we’re at the beach, and she won’t run off. Swimming! I love to swim, my current dog loves to swim. I don’t do any sports or anything with my dogs. Just a lot of outdoor activities.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Not necessarily, no. I’ve always been interested in dock-diving and agility, but I’m not invested in it. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

*5 hours a day on work days, longer on days i have off. i’m not a super social person, so, my dog is my hobby. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I walk about 3.6 miles a day after work with my current dog. Distance from my house to the river park and back. On days I have off in the summer, we do the beach and swimming. In the winter it gets super cold here, so we do short walks and fetch in the yard. On days that’s not possible we do snuffle mats and indoor fetch. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* As much as necessary. My current dog sees a groomer regularly, and that groomer is 2 blocks from my house. I have no limitations as far as grooming needs or budget. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium/large-ish. 40-70 lbs. I’m small and I need a dog I can carry in case of emergency or injury on hikes. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding isn’t a problem. I don’t need a silent dog, but I don’t necessarily want husky level vocal, either. Slobber kind of grosses me out, so the less the better. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* important. we do a lot of road tripping/camping. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly, but it doesn’t have to be attached to my hip, either. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Somewhere in between? 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Prefferably with minimal barking. Limited agression. I would like my dog to be on the friendlier side. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. I have a dog currently in my home and i’m not willing to keep them entirely separate. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Agression towards cats. I know that’s also a training issue, but some breeds obviously have larger prey drives. Resource guarding. Escape artists. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work 7-9 hours in a day, but my mom or a friend drop in on my dog around noon for 30 mins. On my days off, I usually am out of the house for 2-4 hours. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I am the only person in the house. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have a female ACD mix who is almost 2, and 4 cats. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No children live in the home, but a lot of my family members have small children. This would only really be an issue on the holidays, but even then I can separate if need be. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent currently. There are no breed or weight restrictions in place. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Allen County, IN. Yes, I’m aware. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* summer avg is 74F, winter avg is 22.9.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I truly have no breeds that I’m set on or leaning towards, so recommend anything! I also am in no rush to get my second dog, so feel free to hit me with hard to come by breeds as well. 

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

dogs,How do I brush my dog's teeth without betraying his trust?,"I hate having to do this to him and he hates it too.  When he sees the tooth brush he goes and hides.   So my only choice is to catch him off guard.  Lately my routine has been sitting on the carpet, playing with him for a bit, and then picking him up and brushing his teeth.

He's on to that as well, because just now I sat down next to him while he was sleeping (with no intention of brushing his teeth), he woke up and saw me and started this reverse sneezing which he only does when he's severely stressed.  It just breaks my heart.

dogs,Saying goodbye ,"Hello everyone I just really need to talk to someone that has had a similar experience or honestly I just need to get it out. I just put down my 17 year old dog after having her since elementary school. She’d been with me through many stages of my life like moving back to my country, going to a new school, college, moving cities, getting my first job, getting engaged… the worst and best parts of my life. I truly can’t imagine my life without her but I’m happy I gave her the best life possible, I knew she was always happy when she was with me, no matter where we were. I’m happy that she got to see the snow, the beach, the forest, and visited many cities. She was truly the greatest and most wonderful companion. Even though it was hard saying goodbye I’m certain it was the best decision, I always tried to put her needs first before my own. She’s in a better place now.

dogs,Tips for keeping dogs stimulated for (probable) long term hotel stay?,"My house was damaged by hurricane Helene so myself, the other adult in my family, and my two dogs had to leave and go to a hotel. We’ve been here for about five days and my dogs are starting to get restless. We’re likely to be here for awhile, FEMA has approved our stay into December. 

We’re walking them as much as we can, but admittedly both are a bit leash reactive and outside here is overstimulating at the moment with other people and dogs and just an entirely new environment they’re not used to. Not to mention both are used to being off leash to use the bathroom and run due to our fenced in yard. 

Does anyone have any tips to keep them stimulated and entertained in the hotel? I’m giving them bully sticks and such but I don’t want to give too much and upset their stomachs. I’ve brought some of their toys but they’re not super toy oriented dogs. 

Thank you in advance! ",1729695279.0
dogs,Looking for a fitting dog breed,"Hey guys my girlfriend and I are thinking of moving in together as soon as I’m back to working locally and we get our apartment, we’ve both always wanted our own dog. My girlfriend is obviously very interested in a dachshund as she’s seen a bunch of cute dachshunds on tiktok and instagram and I’ve got to say I love them too. But for me they’re just too loud and frequent barkers and diggers. Id like to ask y’all for advice.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Nope, my family got a flatcoated retriever (Who I love over everything as he’s the perfect docile family dog who very rarely barks and is up for any adventure and great with dogs and kids) when I was 12 and we still have him, I helped train him and taught him most of the tricks he know but I would by no means say I’m experienced.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I’d prefer a reputable breeder to get a puppy as I don’t think I’d be able to take on a rescue especially if they have prior traumas as I don’t think I could help him the way he should be helped

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* A dog that barks little to never, doesn’t need too much exercise (40-60 min walk), isn’t too lonely if my girlfriend and I aren’t home as she studies and I work for 8 hours a day, little to no shedding or grooming necessary, and preferably no known hereditary health issues, Id love to take him on longer adventures especially hikes on the weekends though so preferably a dog that doesn’t overheat easily, and he’d have to be friendly and good with other dogs and people especially little kids as there’s babies planned for the future (woohoo)

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* The best match I’ve found with online quizzes is a Field Spaniel, and I love my Flatcoat but I’d prefer not getting the same dog again

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience, Strong recall, and a few simple tricks like roll over and so, but nothing too specific.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? Is so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Nope

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 40-60 minute walks, I would also love a dog that could run with me but from personal experience with my family dog not every dog is all too excited to go on a boring run with no fun sniff and pee stops.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I’d prefer if a professional did it once or twice a year

* Snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Own thing as long as I can snuggle him every now and then and teach him some tricks

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Friendly and not too loud, maybe a bark or two of excitement as that’s always cute but I don’t need an extra alarm system 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Nope, he’s gonna be besties with my family flatcoat

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* There’s probably some but none so grievous that I could think of them right now

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Every weekday between 0730-1545 and maybe longer depending on the overtime (Military 👎)

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My girlfriend wants a doxie but she’d love any dog really. She’s also obviously very ready to care for it as well.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Nope I don’t but he’ll meet my family’s flatcoat once every two months or so

It seems that it's specific to them being frozen. I was taught that frozen is good because it lasts longer and is a little bit more difficult for her. It's also more convenient for me to make them all on the weekend and then freeze them. Can anyone think of any reason why she doesn't want them frozen? I brushed her teeth last night (do often) but will take another look to see if there's anything concerning.

dogs,scent work enrichment game advice needed ,"hi guys! So i’m thinking of this new idea for enrichment but, i have a question. let me explain it so you understand. So i apologize in advance this might be long. 

I want to train my dog this new tracking/scent work/retrieval game inspired by a video I saw. Basically I’ll get a scent on a q tip or crumbled up napkin. Hide a bunch of them in a field of grass. Give her the scent and let her go find them and bring it back to me one by one. I think this will be super tiring for my dog and fun. But, that brings me to my question. What scents can I use? I was thinking dog safe essential oils but she’s gonna have it in her mouth to bring it back to me. Is that safe? I know essential oils are used for scent work for dog sports but the dog doesn’t retrieve the scent or put it in their mouth, correct me if i’m wrong. She won’t eat it (i hope) but i imagine her holding it in her mouth she could probably taste it on her tongue so she’s still ingesting a very little amount and keep in mind I plan to do this often as a fun exercise and eventually I might be putting out 20 or more q tips for her to find depending on how long she wants to go for. The q tip won’t have a lot of essential oil on it. Just a drop. That should be enough to get the scent strong enough to find right? But i don’t know. Maybe i’m thinking into it too much. 

If essential oil isn’t a good idea what are some alternative scents? Preferably something liquid and very pungent so it acts in the same way essential oils do. 

Any thoughts/tips/advice? Is this a good idea? Would you change anything about this game? I’m honestly just looking for ways to tire out my dog other than just going on walks. 

Thank you guys! Have a good night!",1729575599.0

dogs,Looking for a Small/Medium Breed,"1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It will be my first dog in my young-adult life, and the first one I would be the primary caretaker for. I have grown up with a pit-pull lab mix, then a pit-pull miniature schnauzer. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Due to my situation, I'd highly prefer going through a reputable breeder so I can have a better idea of the dog's temperament and energy levels from before they're even born. I don't want to risk getting a dog that'd be too much for me. But rescuing a dog is never completely off the table, I am always open to that.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

A medium to small eager to please dog that loves people and animals. A dog who enjoys doing sports and wants to be your best buddy. They're going to be by my side and have their crazy moments but be able to relax inside the house.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I lean more towards lean, energetic medium sized dog breeds. See a Border Collie, Lagotto Romagnolo, or a Toller(Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever). Recently I've looked a lot more into Border Collies and Mini Aussie's but am looking for other options with a less thick coat and less energy. I've lived with a Samoyed for a period of time and absolutely loved their temperament and friendlessness, but currently I live in a very hot climate and would not feel okay having them with their thick coat. If I didn't live in a hot climate, they'd be the top on my list. If there are any other dog breeds similar to them without the heavy coat I'd love to know. The schnauzer breeds are ones I've looked into and am curious about the standard schnauzer if anyone has experiences with that!

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic obedience, crate training, then I'd like to train them to different dog sports. Specifically, heelwork and obedience training.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

I'd love to do heelwork/dog dancing, obedience, and literally try all the different sports with a dog. Find which sport they love most and let them have fun with it! If that's scent work, agility, or dog diving I don't mind. I'd really just want to find something that they love to do and do it with them. I have zero experience with any dog sport, so it'll be a big learning experience for the both of us.

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1-3 hours would be my personal goal for them.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

I plan on spending at least 1-2 hours a day. I'd like to go into a dog sport, long runs, and going hiking 1-2 times a month. This time does include dog parks, which I'd only go to a few times a month.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am good with daily brushing, and all listed above. I'd take them to professional as needed!

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium breed. Nothing more than 50lbs for me.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Slobber and shedding don't bother me. I can handle a minimal amount of barking, for example- alert barking a few times when someone walks by. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It's very important to me that they can be trained to have a strong and consistent recall

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I'd like a more snuggly dog, one that lies by you or likes to sleep in bed.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

A more eager-to-please dog is preferred.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I'd like for my dog to be alert and have very minimal barking, none if possible.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I will manage an aggressive dog if it comes down to it, but I'd highly like to do everything I can to avoid this outcome.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I'd like to avoid more stubborn and reserved traits with humans and other animals. Any breed that has a thick fur coat that would struggle to be out in hot temperatures (see Samoyed's and Keeshond's).

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Anywhere from 5 hours to 8 hours a day.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

That the dog will not be a large breed and helping to take care of basic necessities.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

2 cats, and I don't plan to have any more pets.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

A few days a week.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

N/A

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I am not aware of any laws banning breeds where I live in FL.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Around 90f on average during the summer, then only down to 60f in the Winter.

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I don't plan to get a dog for at least another year at minimum. As I mentioned in question 4, I am looking for options of other breeds that have less energy than Mini Aussie's or Border Collie's that are still under 50lbs. But the dog will still love doing a sport and be easily trainable, then preferably not stubborn! If anyone else reading this does have an Australian Shepherd (Mini or Standard) in a warmer environment similar to my temperature, how do they do in that warmer environment?",1729546579.0
dogs,Do dogs typically get sweeter as they get older?,"So my mom has a Chihuahua named pumpkin, who has for seven years always had an attitude with me

Just me, she LOOOOOVES, mom, mom is her PERSON.

But you know, I’m not just gonna stop trying to bond with a dog, despite repeated growling & even getting bit on a couple of occasions. 

So I would take things slow with her, try to pet her, take her warnings seriously, and just overall be patient with her.

Overtime I kind of grew on her, she started letting me pet her, then started letting me kiss her a little bit, rarely let me hold her

However both my mom and I have noticed a bigger difference in her behavior.

Usually, I’m the one who approaches her, but she started approaching me.

only took seven years, but she started leaving mom’s lap to sit in my lap, she started asking me for pets, & started letting me hold her more 

She would have NEVER done these things last year.

She started snuggling up against me to give her attention 

SEVEN. DAMN. YEARS. That’s how long it took to get to this point with her.

I’m wondering if it’s because she’s old, she is a rescue, so she’s like 11-ish? I think. I keep forgetting her age 

But she is getting those grey furs in, & I ain’t a teenager anymore. She’s getting older, so Idk if it has something to do with that, or if it’s purely because I’ve been patient with her the entire time

I just feel like I won the lottery with this dog, she trusts me… she knows that I won’t hurt her, she knows she’s safe with me, & she knows I love her 🥹

dogs,Breed Recommendations - Single Household ,"**Introduction**

1.      **Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
I’ve had family dogs growing up these have been bichon mixes. I’ve taken care of friend’s dogs standard poodles, setters, mixed breeds but not taken a sole ownership role.

**2.     Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a** [**reputable breeder**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**?**  
No preference currently, I’d prefer to go for a non-mixed breed to have a better general idea of the dogs tendencies though I know every dog is an individual and can vary from breed standards.

**3.     Describe your ideal dog.**  
A friendly and playful dog good with other dogs of varying sizes and not super independent. I prefer them to look at me for guidance but be comfortable around other people.

**4.     What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
My favorite dog breed is the wirehaired pointing griffon, though they are high energy and I am nervous about not being able to keep up with them. I like their personality, size and coat type. Bench labs have interested me as well, but the shedding has put me off.

**5.     What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
Basic obedience, sit, stay, place, lay down, break. Maybe some tricks but I’m more interested in training related to keeping good manners and them safe while maneuvering in a public space.

**6.     Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
No

**Care Commitments**

7) **How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
The office I work at is dog friendly so they would be with me all day, short breaks to play, training sessions, and walks are acceptable and encouraged where I work.

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**  
I anticipate 30 min exercise in the morning two 20 min walks throughout the day, a half hour to an hour in the evening. These can and would mostly all be a bit longer on weekends.  
  


9) **How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
I’m open to doing what is necessary for the animal, paying a groomer is not an issue and learning to do some things on my own such as nails, ears etc. is totally fine

**Personal Preferences**

10) **What size dog are you looking for?**  
I’d prefer a medium to large-ish size dog, A lab/Golden would be the larger size.

11) **How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
I’d prefer lower shedding, less of a tendency to bark, and as little slobber as possible

12) **How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
Not very important, though something like a grey hound never being safe off leash would make me nervous if they ever somehow got out.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) **Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
A Velcro dog would be great

14) **Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**  
Closer to the eager-to-please

15) **How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**  
I would want to dog to greet them happily or with a polite aloofness. Often times at work I have people stop by my office so they would need to be tolerant of other people entering “Their space”

16) **Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
I do not want a dog that has tendencies towards dog aggression.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  
Tendencies towards anxiousness are probably something I’d prefer to avoid, though I know some dogs are more confident than others.

**Lifestyle**

18) **How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
Not often and likely for a few hours at most such as trips to stores that don’t allow animals or during a work event.

19) **What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**  
No other preferences

20) **Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**  
I have reptile and fish which would never interact with the dog. My coworkers have various dog breeds ranging from Chihuahua to Irish wolfhound so the dog should at least be okay around other dogs. (My office door closes so the animals aren’t just free roaming and they would have opportunities to take breaks away from other animals.

21) **Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
I have a young nephew who would occasionally be around the dog and sometimes kids come into the office. They would never be around the dog unsupervised and my nephew is dog savvy.

22) **Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
It’s a rental with no restrictions. It’s a small cottage with a large yard.

23) **What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
Cape Cod Massachusetts, my town has no breed restrictions.

24) **What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
It’s hot and humid in the summer and cold and snowy in the winter.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) **Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant**.  
The town I work in is VERY dog friendly so they would go with me most places, I have a truck and would like the animal to be able to hop in so a giant dog wouldn’t work for me helping them get in or out if needed and I’d prefer to not have a tiny dog.

He lives with my mother while I'm in college (I come home on holidays and spend all my time with him). They have a solid routine, we can all agree my dog is very happy and well taken care of. Recently he started barking for 10\\15 minutes when left alone (we have a camera), nothing too serious, but still weird as he never did that. he looks anxious when my mother is getting ready to go out\\go to work. 

Yesterday they went to the park for one hour, he run around the whole time, had the time of his life, then after a couple of hours after they came back my mother went to the cinema. He barked for two hours straight. 

What is happening? Literally nothing changed in their life. The only thing is that he was sick about three weeks ago, throwing up once\\twice a day bile. They went to the vet that did a scan an noticed that his gallbladder was inflamed\\bigger. They gave him meds and he stopped throwing up, he's eating and drinking as usual, active and happy.

I’m the one who does the primary work like vet appointments and grooming, I buy his food, I do his training, order and give him his medicine, I boil his eggs every week, etc. We are 50/50 on walks and feeding. But he just likes playing and cuddling with my husband more even though I try to play and cuddle the same way.

When I moved out, I had a temporary period of being away from him, but my mom had to go back to india to take care of her dad who was ill, so she gave him to me permanently. By that time, I had moved in with my (now) husband, so Benji moved in with us. 

At first he was hesitant towards my husband because he doesn’t really like men, but now he’s warmed up so much to him. At night I wake up and see that the dog is spooning him, which is funny and cute, but makes me feel bad that he didn’t come to me.

Like I said, I know this isn’t Benji’s fault and it’s not really about me, it’s just hard to not take it personally sometimes. I’d never change the way I treat him though, I love him with all my might. And as I mentioned, I know he does love me. He’s always thrilled to see me when I come home from work, he does give me affection and come sit with me plenty of times, I just wish that he wasn’t so obvious about who he prefers. 

When we were at my mom’s house, she used to be a bit jealous that he obviously loved me better, but that was kinda cause I did all his care and walks, so I thought it was pretty natural. Now that I’m still his primary caregiver but he likes my husband better, it just feels kinda unfair sometimes lol",1729516467.0

dogs,[Breeds] - Dog breed recommendation for a city couple.,"
[Breeds]

Introduction

	1.	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

	•	No. We’ve had dogs in the past. They were all adopted at least 2 years old and were already housebroken. They knew basic commands, which we reinforced, and we taught them more basics.*

	2.	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

	•	Either.*

	3.	Describe your ideal dog.

	•	I prefer a female dog that is good with our 4-year-old Siberian female cat (who was raised with interactions with dogs and is great with dogs that aren’t barkers). I want a non-barker that is medium-sized and able to fit comfortably in a 4-door sedan, leaning towards the larger side. The dog should have long hair with medium maintenance and low anxiety, as we live in a city where it will need to be okay with sirens, horns, and the occasional fireworks. It should be semi-active—a running companion would be nice, but it doesn’t have to be. Normal activities would include long and short city walks, dog parks, hikes, and leisure time.*

	4.	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

	•	We initially considered Cockapoos and Miniature Labs but learned about the poor breeding processes associated with them. We are now looking into Cocker Spaniels or other Spaniel types and Poodles.*

	5.	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

	•	House training, basic sit/stay commands, fetch, speak, etc. We’ve trained our cat to follow some basics, so I’d be interested in venturing into more advanced commands with a dog.*

	6.	Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g., agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g., hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

	•	No.*

Care Commitments

	7.	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

	•	2-3 hours.*

	8.	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly, and does that include using a dog park?

	•	1-2 hours.*

	9.	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

	•	I’m willing to brush 3-4 times a week and am open to doing most of the grooming at home, with professional grooming once or twice a year.*

Personal Preferences

	10.	What size dog are you looking for?

	•	Medium—18-25 lbs.*

	11.	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

	•	Medium shedding. Non-barker (as noted above regarding the cat). Minimal slobbering.*

	12.	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

	•	I don’t expect the dog to be unleashed in an unfenced area.*

Dog Personality and Behavior

	13.	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

	•	Snuggly.*

	14.	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

	•	Its own thing.*

	15.	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

	•	Since we live in an apartment, I wouldn’t want them to bark at every single door noise. I would like the dog to come upon entry and warmly greet visitors and strangers.*

	16.	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

	•	No. We live in a city, and they will be exposed to many dogs on normal walks.*

	17.	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

	•	Being aggressive, excessive barking, and being prey-driven.*

Lifestyle

	18.	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

	•	Minimal. We both work from home, so the dog may be left alone for a few hours during dinners and get-togethers a few times a week.*

	19.	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house, and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

	•	My partner and I have made a mutual decision to share responsibilities for caring for the dog.*

	20.	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

	•	Yes, a female Siberian cat who is 4 years old. She has had many interactions with dogs while we dog sit or visit my parents’ house (who have two dogs). She’s great with dogs.*

	21.	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

	•	No.*

	22.	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

	•	I rent and have no limitations on pets.*

	23.	What city or country do you live in, and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

	•	I live in North Jersey, USA, and I’m not aware of any laws banning certain breeds.*

	24.	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

	•	In North Jersey, typical summer temperatures average around 80-90°F (27-32°C), while winter temperatures average around 20-40°F (-6 to 4°C).*

Additional Information and Questions

	25.	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

	•	Our cat is better behaved when we have a dog in the house. It keeps her entertained, and we know she would benefit greatly from a companion.  We live in a major city but do have a decent size apartment (1600 sqft) with a private outdoor deck.*

	26.	Feel free to ask any questions below.

	•	No.*

dogs,Breed recommendation for second dog?," 1)	Will this be your first dog? We have a neutered, 6.5 year old male Aussie. He is well trained. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder] We're not opposed to either but we went through a breeder for our current Aussie. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog. Gets along well with dogs, toddlers, cats, likes hiking. Social, confident. I don't have a coat preference but my S/O doesn't seem to like short coat breeds. She says she likes fluffier dogs. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? Golden Retriever, Duck Roller and another Aussie all seem to fit the bill. We'd kind of like to try something different, but another Aussie would also be fine. S/O is most interested in Golden's, I'm just concerned about their activity ceiling - will they be able to hike with my current Aussie and I? I also love Berners but have the same activity concerns, and my S/O is anxious about the short life span. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? Tricks will be pretty basic, but good socialization is an absolute must. We take our dog everywhere we are allowed to take him.

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? Hiking. My current Aussie and I will do 6-12 mile hikes in the Catskills, cold weather only - but long hikes through what is for him sometimes chest deep snow. I want to ensure what ever dog we get next can keep up with him. I understand a puppy can't go right into that, we will build it up, but I want to know it's ""ceiling"" should be decently high. 

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? We both work from home. A two mile morning walk is pretty standard with multiple fetch, play or short training sessions throughout the day. 

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? We keep our dog very active between hiking, walking and playing. We currently have about two to three hours of dedicated dog exercise time and are expecting to increase this for at least the first year of a new puppy's training. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? We do some home grooming and bathing but routinely take our Aussie to a groomer as well. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for? 30 pounds or higher, Ranger is about 50 pounds and we want a dog that feels comfortable playing with him. 

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? We have an Aussie, our life is shedding. We trained him not to bark reactively at people walking by the house, so as long as the new dog can be trained similarly, barking isn't an issue. As far as slobber, equal or less than a Bernese. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? Not important. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? Snuggly preferred but open to suggestions if they check our other boxes. 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? Sit stay come discipline is an absolute must and we will train this religiously. Outside of that, we're flexible. 

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  Greet, yes. Barking is okay too if they're coming into the property, just don't get aggressive. 

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? We want to avoid any breeds where this is a known issue, but would work with our puppy to try and correct it if it happened. 

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? Aggression of any kind. We have a toddler and a cat. 

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone? Rarely and when it does happen never more than six hours. We work from home and when we can't take ranger with us, he goes to my in laws or a doggie daycare. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? S/O and I agree on just about everything and split dog responsibilities evenly. 

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they? We have a 3 year old neutered siberian cat and we imagine we will get a second one at some point. 

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? Daily. For its entire life. 

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? We own and will keep owning, no restrictions. 

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? My municipality has no breed bans, but I don't think I want any breed that is commonly regulated as we may move in the next few years. USA, north east. 

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? Summers peak in the 90s, humid, winters bottom out below 10 overnight.

dogs,Finding the right sidekick to add to the family!,"Hi all, thanks in advance for your input and advice! 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?



\* No, I’ve raised two dogs, and often watch my friends’ and family’s dogs. (Maltipoo to Doberman to Doodles)



I adopted a 2yo purebred Jack Russell 3 years ago however, and cared for her for 10 months but realized we were not a mutual fit due to her intense hatred of other dogs (my family nicknamed her Mike Tyson after she tried to bite my cousin’s dog in the ear). She had been raised by an elderly couple inside of an RV during covid, so she had no social skills and rarely was exercised unfortunately. She was super dog-aggressive and anxious. I took her to professional training twice a week and had to walk her 5-8 times a day to get her energy out, along with runs and playtime. The aggression was what made me realize it wouldn’t work out, as I live in a city and I think she needed to be on a farm. Rehomed her after this, and she is doing better! 



2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?



\* Would love to rescue, but my needs are pretty specific, listed below



3)	Describe your ideal dog.



\* Looking for an active small sidekick! I’d love a dog that is ok living in an apartment with me, but going on daily walks and the energy to go on long hikes, backpacking, and traveling on weekends. I want a smart dog that I can teach tricks, but not a lunatic like my Jack Russell. Needs to get along with other dogs well (will socialize the dog and train him/her young!). Also, my girlfriend has allergies to dogs, so looking for a dog that doesn’t shed too much. I also would like to be able to occasionally take the dog in the plane for short trips (not a dealbreaker, but nice to have). Another nice to have would be to have a dog that can learn decently reliable recall, I’d love to be able to take the dog off leash in safe areas so they can follow on a hike or do their thing



To sum up:

* Active, able to keep up on hikes and runs (when an adult) and go reasonable distances. 
* Low allergy risk for my gf
* Small enough to take anywhere
* Friendly with other dogs and people with socialization
* Not a crazy barker, although I am willing to train that if necessary
* Recall is possible through training



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



\* I’ve narrowed it down in my research to border terriers, it seems they are pretty stout little guys and switch between apartment living and long hikes. They are also pretty good with humans and other dogs. I’ve looked at mini schnauzers as well and mini poodles, but am worried about barking for schnauzers and energy for poodles. Little worried about recall with Border terrier, seems like they require quite a bit of training for good recall, which I would be able to do. Let me know if i’m totally off or missed anything!



5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?



\* Tricks would be fun but most importantly a good recall, basic commands (sit, down, leave it, stay, etc), and good leash manners.



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?



\* I would be open to doing a sport if it helped the dog gain confidence. But it would be less about winning and more for training/confidence for the pup



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?



\* Happy to do 1-1.5 hours of walking/running + active games/training a day. Otherwise I work from home so happy to do 4-6 short walks. Understandably more time for a puppy. 



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  



\* 1-1.5 hours. Walking, fetch, hide and seek, hiding treats, etc. Yes there are a few dog parks near me, I’d love to take her to meet up with dog friends to play. 



9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?



\* I can do 5-10 mins a day or take them to a groomer when necessary. Happy to cut nails and bathe the dog too.



\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*



10)	What size dog are you looking for?



\* Small, would be nice if they could fit in a small crate to go on the plane in the cabin from time to time, but not a dealbreaker.



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



\* My gf is allergic to dogs (manageable with medication + less dander/shedding), so the less the better. I live in an apartment so a small amount of barking is ok, but ideally I can train them to bark less or when it’s reasonable.



12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



\* Fairly important, it would be nice if I could train a consistent recall for going hiking or emergency situations



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



\* Definitely a dog that likes to snuggle. Ok if they’re sometimes aloof but definitely prefer a sidekick that wants to snuggle and receive some love!



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?



\* Eager to please 



15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  



\* A bark is ok, but not uncontrollable barking. I’d prefer them not to jump (happy to train this), and learn to be patient and sit until the person comes to them. 



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?



\* No, I’ve dealt with this before and I want a dog that can get along with other dogs. Ok if the dog is defensive where appropriate.



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



\* Just dog/people aggression and also don’t want a dog that is afraid of everything



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



\* I work remotely, but would like to be able to leave an adult dog alone occasionally for 4-5 hours when necessary.



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 



\* My gf will help care for and walk the dog, but I will be the main caretaker. 



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



\* No current pets



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



\* No



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

dogs,Breed Recommendations for a Teacher/Nurse family,"My partner and I have been talking about getting a dog in the next few years. We both grew up with dogs and we miss having one around. I am a public school teacher and he is a nurse who works the night shift at a hospital. If we are to get a dog, we would wait until the summer when I am off from work so we can dedicate plenty of time to the crucial puppy/new dog stage.

**Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Both myself and my partner have grown up around dogs our whole lives. My family had two dogs, Killian (GSD/Lab) and Bates (GSD/Malinois). Currently my parents have a GSD named Otto. My partner's family had boxers and we frequently babysit their current boxer, Amos. I had no part in training Killian, but as a college student and adult, I spent a lot of time with Bates taking him on walks, trips, teaching tricks, and other quality time. This dog would be our first dog together as adults.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We both have talked about wanting to get a dog from a breeder rather than a shelter or rescue. We would prefer having our first dog together to be more predictable, though I am open to looking into specific breed rescues.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

An ideal dog would be one that is friendly towards everyone and would like to spend time with the family. We would also like a dog that is happy to relax but can also enjoy long walks and play time. We live in a pretty active town in a smaller apartment so we would like a dog that can thrive in a more suburban environment. We also want a dog breed that is easily trainable and not very stubborn.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We have a list of different dogs that we have talked about. Golden retriever, lab, greyhound, poodle, and cocker spaniel are ones we are both interested in. I Goldens and poodles are just great, all-around dogs that would fit a lot of our needs. Greyhounds are on the radar because they are more active in short bursts instead of needing hours and hours of physical activity. I've also been looking into smaller breeds like shih tzus, pekingese, and coton de tulear since their small size would do well in our 1-story apartment and they are loyal and friendly companions.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? We are both pro-crate training. This would be important for us especially during the day when we are away. I am also going to do leash training so we can take the dog on walks on the various hiking trails in our area. In addition to basic commands, I would also like to teach fun tricks. I've taught Bates some fun tricks like playing dead, army crawling, and fist bumps.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

We are not interested in competing in any sports. We don't have the time to train for these consistently.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

During the summers and holidays, I can devote most of my time to the dog's training and exercise. During the school year, the dog would be able to get at least one hour of walks a day, in addition to the evening hours 7-10pm for playtime, training, and interaction. We do not have children, so the dog would receive the bulk of our attention in the evenings.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

The dog would be able to get at least two 30 min walks per day. When my partner is off, the dog could get a third 30 minute walk in the afternoon. We could also provide about an hour of additional exercise in the evenings through playing fetch, tug, etc. We have access to a dog park if needed but I would prefer to avoid it due to safety concerns.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am open to daily brushing, learning how to trim hair, clean ears, clip nails, etc. For long-haired or curly-coated dogs on my list, we are willing to seek professional grooming as well.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Any size, provided the breed can adapt to living in a small 2bd apartment.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

We can handle shedding of any amount. We would prefer a quieter breed, or one that is willing to laze around during the day while my partner sleeps after his night shift. We have neighbors upstairs with 2 dogs that bark and their barking can make it hard for my partner to fall asleep. I do not tolerate drool or globs of slobber of any amount. I am ok with dog kisses, but I don't want to receive slime baths. My in-laws boxer is incredibly slobbery and it is hard for me to tolerate.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

As of right now, it is not that important as we cannot let dogs off leash in our neighborhood. But this would be something I want to train in case we move to a house without a fence. A dog with good recall is really important to me, again for safety reasons.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A mix of both would be nice. I never had snuggly dogs and my dogs growing up were not allowed on the couch. This is still something my partner and I are compromising on! If the dog isn't snuggly, I would still want the dog to want to be pet and relax where the people are. Bates did not like snuggling at all, but he was very persistent about being loved on with pets. He gave kisses and would make us hold his paws while he layed at our feet.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

More eager-to-please. I want a dog that enjoys training, is quick to learn, and is highly motivated.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

We want a dog that is friendly to strangers, children, other dogs, and family. We want a dog that is happy to have visitors and friends over and will quickly adapt to new people.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, and this is a hard no. We live in a neighborhood and town with a lot of dogs. Our next door neighbors have a small dog, our upstairs neighbors have 2 dogs, and our other neighbors at the end have a small dog too. Along with a high dog population, a lot of people take their dogs for walks on the trails around town, which is something we would frequently do with our dog.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I do not like jumping. My in-laws boxer jumps and he is extremely rough, especially since he is so big. I would also like to avoid reactivity and resource guarding.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

On days where I am at work and my partner is sleeping after his shift, the dog would be alone for about 8 hours a day. This happens roughly 3x a week. On off days, the dog would not be alone except during errands, trips, etc. I do use a pet sitter that could come on days where the dog would be alone for excessive periods of time.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Both myself and my partner are interested in similar breeds, though he isn't as interested in the smaller dogs as I am. He would be just as involved in the dog's life as I would be. The first few months with the dog would be a bit unbalanced as I would be the one who could spend the most time training a new puppy/dog.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We currently have 3 rats, a leopard gecko, and a crested gecko. We are also planning on getting fire bellied toads in the spring/summer. In our apartment, they have their own pet room. The door is kept closed. While a dog with a low or nonexistent prey-drive is preferable, we are able to manage a dog that does have a prey drive. My dog, Bates, had a very high drive and over the 5 years of having these pets with Bates, we had 0 accidents. It's something I am experienced with and highly vigilant of.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No. We do not have children. However, we would still want a dog that is friendly and good with children so we can have our young family members over and be confident while taking the dog for walks around our neighborhood, town, and the hiking trails.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We currently rent a 2bd apartment about 1,058sqft. There are no breed or weight restrictions in our neighborhood. We plan to eventually own a home, but that is not for a few more years.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

We live in Chester County, PA. There are no laws for breed restrictions. Only private landlord restrictions, which do not apply to us.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summers are hot and humid (85F+) and winters are cold and dry (40F and below).

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We have a pet sitter that we use for long trips and there's also a lot of doggy daycares in the area. We don't really have a yard, but are within walking distance of the Schuylkill River Trail and live close to Valley Forge. There's also a dog park nearby, but would only use it sparingly for safety reasons.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

dogs,Please help me find a good breed for me!,"Soo I'm probably gonna move as soon as I can (next 1-2 years or so), and I definitely decided that I would like - if it's possible - a dog so I'm not completely alone. So in the template I'm gonna answer like I already live where I'm going to, as a reference 

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

Yes, but I don't mind extra work if it's a breed that requires some more attention. I have no direct experience owning dogs.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

Preferably from a breeder, cause I feel like raising a puppy might be easier (not saying it always is but I can influence it's behaviour better I think)

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

I would like a dog that's obedient but can still think for himself, if that makes sense. Preferably one that can stay alone for a few hours as an adult, and doesn't mind periods of not a lot of human interaction - like 1-3 hours per day by itself

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I particularly like large dog breeds. I have considered German Shepherds and Greyhounds but I haven't really got to know a lot about their complete care requirements yet. Also, I would prefer short-haired dogs, at least for my first one.

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

I would like to train him to help me with daily tasks, like picking up and putting laundry into the basket, putting dishes in the dishwasher, helping me make the bed, ect. ect. Not necessarily a full-time service dog, but I get tired or even dizzy when moving too much/quick really easily some days so I would like some help with day-to-day activities. Also would like him to go to specific spots when asked & stay there until called up, for example when people are over (I have a friend who's scared of dogs being close to her so it would help if he could stay in his bed then)

**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

No

Care Commitments

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

As long as I can, I'll probably seek out something I can work from home, therefore I'll be there majority of the time. Preferably 50% or less of the day though 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Walks obviously, length of them not more than 2-3 hrs and sometimes dog park trips yea (not sure how often tho) I'd prefer a dog thats perfectly fine with lots of exercise but also perfectly fine with less

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Open to allat except professional, I'll much rather like to do it myself. Cleaning, trimming hair ect won't be a problem

Personal Preferences

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Large Medium or Large (if there's none I would be okay with a medium-small)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Not that much, I'll probably live in an apartment. I prefer little to none to all of these

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Don't care about that too much but it would be nice

Dog Personality and Behavior

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A good mix of both, cause I have those moments too where I want to be left alone and then I want to cuddle non stop. But if I had to choose just one then snuggly I suppose 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Also a good mix to both. Eager to please when I need it to, do it's own thing when not doing tasks.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Cautious, but being able to differentiate between threatening and non threatening behaviour so it knows how to act accordingly. I would like it to just look at maybe boop visitiors to say hello, but not get too excited and jump at em.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Not really no

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

VERY energetic dogs. I don't think I can handle that, I don't think I'm mobile enough to do that lmfao

Lifestyle

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not more than 6-8 hrs daily typically, depends on if I go to school while studying

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

I'll be alone!

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

I have cats currently but they most likely won't be following me. I would however like to get another cat or 2 before the dog moves in, so one that gets along with them would be nice. I also have fish and am looking to adopt other animals like mice or birds in the future.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I'm planning to rent yes, but there's enough apartments that shouldn't hold restrictions.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Germany, and I'm planning to move to Berlin. Not aware of any laws.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

No Idea, it's so difficult every year. Out from the top of my head I'd say summer max 30° C, winter max. -10°C.

Additional Information and Questions

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Try to ignore the financial costs with your recommendations - If not possible, I won't get a dog. I'm just looking to see what breed could work for later in life :)

dogs,Dog breed suggestions!,"

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I've owned dogs my whole life and have trained all of mine myself. 

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Not necessarily, though when I adopt this dog I would like for it to be a young puppy.

* A medium to large size dog 50-70 lbs, weary of people but not outright aggressive, good with other animals, minimal slobber, short to medium length coat.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* A few breeds I've looked at are the Beauceron, Doberman, Belgian Tervuren, and the Dalmation. Any other breeds that would be good for me to look at, that aren't too rare? I like these dogs for their appearance, with the first 3 having darker coat colors and a more intimidating physique to hopefully make a potential intruder think twice before entering my home. 

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 

* I usually just train my dogs random tricks or useful things such as pushing open doors for me or retrieving items.

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Training time will be as needed for the individual dog, I usually play about 1 or 2 hours with my current dog per day, when not on walks we usually hang out and watch tv. 

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* I usually take 30 minute runs twice daily before and after work with my dog, on weekends I am a bit more active and when weather is nice I take my dog for walks in the forest which can be 2-3 hours over difficult terrain. I do not use dog parks because I do not allow my dog to interact with dogs I do not know. 

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* I currently have one other dog and a pair of geckos and in the future will be expanding my reptile collection, they of course will not interact with the dog though and will have a separate room that my dogs will not be allowed in. I am considering adopting a cat but the cat would come before the dog so the new dog would grow up around the cat and be accustomed to it. (I previously owned a cat so my current dog is good with them) 

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

The summer is typically 90-100, last winter it got down to -5 (Fahrenheit). The dog won't be kept outside for extended periods of time though, especially when weather is intense.

Other Information: I am avoiding ""bully"" breeds and German Shepherds. I personally do not like bully breeds at all and have had too many bad experiences with friend's GSDs.  
  
A bit more about me and my current dog to give an idea of the type of owner I am: My current dog is a Border Collie, I want something with good energy levels to keep up with her, but maybe not quite as insane because my girl does not have an off switch lol. She is the best trained dog I've ever had and I'm very proud she's mine as all her training has been done exclusively by me, I've had her since she was 8 weeks old. She never gets into anything, I can leave food or other desirable items out in front of her all day and she will not touch them without an okay, has a great recall, and knows various weird tricks. I trained her to know both verbal commands and hand gestures so that if she goes deaf with age she will still understand what I am asking of her. She's also crate trained, and minds very well when corrected. I don't follow any specific training methods, I just get a sense of what the dog responds to best and work from there. I'm big on using body language to convey a message when correcting behaviors. I fix my dog an enrichment toy before work every day so she has something to be entertained by for a little bit. While my BC is a great dog, she looks like she came out of a cartoon (Lanky legs, one ear is floppy, the other isnt, always bright eyed) and thinks everybody is her best friend so she is not very intimidating.

dogs,Looking for experience with Prozac,"I’m curious if anyone has experienced this while using prozac on their dog. My guy has various forms of severe anxiety. When it’s balanced, prozac works well on him. He is pretty much back to 90% his normal self. The hard part though, is keeping the drug balanced. To get him built up to that, takes a min of two months. Yes, I know that’s not the official claim. But we’ve gone though this many times now, and I’ve heard other people say the same thing… For him the loading period is at least two months, and during that time he’s massively paranoid and doesn't want to eat. If the balance could be maintained, this wouldn’t be an issue. But I’ve found the tiniest thing will screw it up. For instance, if he’s a bit runny for a few days (as dogs are once in a while), it’s like it will reset, and then he has to go through the whole big long buildup all over again. It’s very frustrating. Has anybody else experienced this with the drug? Thanks.",1729363506.0

dogs,Dog Breed Recommendation (Apartment/ Cats),"**Introduction**

* Yes!

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We prefer a reputable breeder but are also open to adopting a rescue dog. If we go the rescue route, we would prefer an adult dog for the sake of predictability.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* We are looking for a long-haired dog between 10 to 20 lbs that gets along well with cats. We prefer not to have a short-muzzled breed, as we’re not confident in managing the extra care they require. We would like to avoid dogs prone to excessive barking. Ideally, the dog would be intelligent, easy-going, and come from a healthier breed with fewer genetic illnesses.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* We really like Westies, but we realized their strong prey drive might not be the best fit for a household with cats. We also like the appearance of Cavapoos; however, we understand that designer breeds may not be ethical, so we wouldn’t purchase one. That said, if there’s a great fit among rescue dogs, we’d be happy to consider a small poodle-mix.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* We’re looking for a dog with basic obedience and minimal excessive barking. (We understand that training and socialization are key factors in managing behavior.)

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

* We're happy to take care of all the necessary brushing and grooming, and we're also willing to pay for professional grooming services as needed!

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* 10lbs-20lbs.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Slobber: Fine, though we would prefer a breed with minimal slobber.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More eager to please

* We have the same preferences

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have gentle and friendly cats. Two of them seem interested in dogs and would likely enjoy playing with the dog.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Rent. Under 80-lbs. No aggressive breeds.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* No

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* hot summers and mild winters (not too cold).",1729321878.0
dogs,"Do dogs need daily walks, even if they have a large yard to play in?"," We have a half acre yard, that has a perimeter to keep the dogs inside it. We let the dogs out at any time they want, and for however long they want. My question is.. do they also need to be taken on actual walks?
 One of our dogs (younger, small little brick dog) scratches at us and whines, even when she doesn't seem to want out, or food. Don't know what to do at this point 😕 I thought maybe it's too much energy. 

Some info: She was being abused unbeknownst to us by my late father in law, and had MAJOR anxiety. I don't know if the two are related ☹️ 
She is not a specific breed, she looks like a pug, but less pug face ya know? Kinda looks like a seal puppy.

Edited to add: I think we will try out some of the suggestions here, I appreciate all the advice! I forgot to add that I am in a lot of pain all the time, and that has contributed to my lack of walking the doggies 🐕 I will try some short walks, some training exercises and just engagement in general 😊 Thanks everyone who responded.

dogs,Did my dog do spite peeing? Please advise. ,"Hi,

so we have a  male 6 yo Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, not spayed or neutered. He went through puppy school and dog school. He knows basic commands like sit, down, give paw etc. He is healthy (except sometimes dry eyes and ear infections), we visit his vet regularly. He has a friendly personality, loves humans and especially kids, is quite food motivated and usually easy to handle, sleeps through the night, doesn't destroy things, etc.

Now why I am asking is, my husband and I just followed the vet's instructions to keep his paw pads short of hair  on the bottom side (where he walks on the street) and to keep the hair inside his floppy ears short. We are supposed to use a shearing machine that looks like an electrial razor, but with a protective thingy at the front, so you don't cut the skin or paw. 

I held his paws and head while my husband trimmed the fur between the paw pads and inside his ears. He struggled a bit, but nothing major. He got treats after every paw and every ear and three more at the end of the procedure. He was quite agitated and had the zoomies for a bit and kept shaking his ears, probably because the shorter hair tickled him (the vet did this exact procedure a few weeks ago, he showed the same behavior back then with the head shaking).

But then he jumped onto the couch and peed in a long streak over all 4 pillows, the blanket underneath and my husband's hoody, which he had left there. 

I had walked him like 1-2 hours before that, he didn't drink anything after that and his last complete body check-up was about six weeks ago.   
He has not peed onto the couch for the last few years, nor on our bed or any carpet or floor, only when he was younger and only twice on the couch (though never onto the carpet or floor). 

So ... what do you think? Was he either angry with us for tickling his paws and ears with the razor or was it more of a loss of control for him? He follows me almost everywhere, some people have said that this is controlling behavior, not protective behavior or that he wants to be with me because he loves me (which other people have been telling me). 

Is it anthropomorphic to think he was mad at us for doing things to him he didn't like? And that peeing on the couch was his telling us he didn't like the hair cutting procedure?

dogs,Finding a harness that fits neck and chest,"I recently adopted a mixed breed from the shelter, and I'm finding it near impossible to get a harness that fits. The poor guy is built from spare parts, as the vet put it. A harness is non-negotiable because he's got a high prey drive, so I want to feel like he's secured while being able to track scents and be out in nature. He has a thinner neck and a more barrel chest. (Neck: 14.5 in; Chest: 23 in)

Does anyone else have a hard to fit dog? Has anyone found a harness that can accommodate the big difference between neck and chest sizes? A lot of the harness brands I'm interested in don't even include the neck measurement. I'm going crazy because I can't bring him anywhere with lots of critters right now, and I feel so bad about it.

dogs,Crunch/crackle toys for a small super chewer?,"I have a Yorkie that LOVES crunching and crackling. He goes nuts for water bottles.

However, he also loves to chew and gnaw on toys. Only rubber toys like Kongs and Chuckit balls survive. I got him the Petstages crunchy bone, but he chewed through the soft clear rubber. He has the JW Crackleheads ball but the inner core isn't crunchy anymore. He LOVED it though, and I might just get a few more of those. It was a little too big for him, thought.

I have looked into the ZippyPaws toys where you can put a bottle inside. He's had their squeaky donut which held up very well, but these seemed thin to me. Maybe I should just try one.

Kong Squeezz seems nice, but I've seen bad reviews.

Maybe the crinkly egg from Bark would be nice too, but I'm worried he'd just destroy it.

dogs,Tips against home alone boredom?,"For context, my girl is a 7 years old Australian Shepherd, that I adopted last summer. Over the last year and a half I spent most of my time at home, working only two days a week (a small side gig while I was recovering from burn-out). Now I have recently applied for a full time job, and I have some worries concerning my dog, if she's gonna be lonely and/or bored spending considerably more time home alone. 

I've had dogs my entire life and knew when I adopted her that I would return to a more active live eventually, therefore made sure to not get a dog too hyper and demanding (might sound contradictory with her breed, but  this one is a real couch potato). She's very chill and spends most of her time lounging around. We have a large yard and she exercises everyday but can skip a proper walk one day without going nuts. She's the only dog but has a cat friend who she adores. Overall she does very well when staying home alone, but I know it's gonna take some adaptation time to get used to not having me around nearly as often once I start working again. What would be your best tips to keep her entertained and not feeling lonely or rejected? ",1729285811.0
dogs,[Breeds] Please help my find the right breed!,"
**Introduction**

1\)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be my first dog, i had friends, neighbors and family members with dogs so I have always been around them and volunteered my fair share of time loking after them

2\)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Being that my partner and I don't have a bunch of free time to stay home, we cant do a puppy right now so a rescue seems like our current path.

3\)	Describe your ideal dog.

* under 45lbs, has the on/off switch for playing, hiking, swimming and then chilling on the couch for those rainy/lazy days. Ideally eager to please and not stubborn. I don't want it sitting in my lap 24/7 but I also want my couch buddy so as long as the dog is not whining or begging for pets I'll be happy. I recognize training/socializing also helps this.

4\)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* If I could have a springer spainel with none of the crazy energy, that would be exactly what I am looking for. I hate to say that the esthetic of the dog is important to me but thats just the reality of things. I absolutely love the look of spaniel breeds like ESS, Brittany, Boykin, and love labs too but they are just too big. I can deal with high energy I just wont be able to give it 2-3 hours of sprinting everyday. I've learned that mental stimulation is almost just as effective if not more effective in getting rid of that energy so that is definitely something i will work into our routine. Not a huge fan of curly or super long coats. Definitely do not want hair growing over the eyes or any beard action. 

5\)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The biggest thing I can think of is walking off leash and instilling a great recall. I don't have any plans of hunting regularly but i do go once in a while so i will want the ability to let my dog go and be confident i can get it to come back without taking off.

6\) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No, but as i mentioned above, it might happen every now and then.

**Care Commitments**

7\) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* At least an hour a day of playing that involves training. I want to train while the dog is still engaged and does not loose interest. So maybe 45 min training a day and 1.5 hours of full play and then 2 hours of chilling around the house until bed. Im thinking Mon-Fri for this.

8\) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* One hour, minimum. More on the weekends or days i get home early from work 

9\)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I don't really want to have to go to the groomers so probably not a ton of maintenance requirements but if it needed any I would do them once a week/ or every two weeks. Depends on how much hair starts accumulating

**Personal Preferences**

10\)	What size dog are you looking for?

* 30-45 lbs. Nothing less and nothing more

11\) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding: Can handle medium shedding, I'd rather not take my dog to work with me on my clothes everyday.

* Barking: Excessive barking is a concern. Alert barking is fine, but barking which doesn't stop could be a problem.

* Slobber: Average slobber is fine.

12\) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Extremely important. We are looking for a dog we can trust off-leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13\) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Definitely snuggly but to a certain point. I want a couch buddy but i dont want to have my buddy sitting in my lap with its face or butt in my face. So a little control would be nice. Definitely do not want my dog begging for pets constantly.

14\) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More on the side of Eager-to-please but independence is going to be key for those 8 hour days alone while we are at work.

15\) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* One bark and I mean one bark, is fine, anything after that I will not allow. It's food that people know we have a dog but in no way am i looking for security.

16\) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No.

17\) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Overly-reactive behavior, destructive separation anxiety, excessive (beyond normal) barking. Food related aggression.

**Lifestyle**

18\) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 5 times a week the dog may be left alone for 4-5 hours. Partner works from home currently** so that could change but we will never leave it longer than 8 hours, any longer and its coming with us. Also ideally I'm getting a new job soon and it will either be hybird working from home and in the field work or ideally I can just bring it with me to work everyday. I'm an environmental scientist so thats sometimes an option for us

19\) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Both partner and I are dog lovers, and are both committed to doing the required work (feeding, cleaning, exercising, training, etc).

20\) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Currently have a cat that used to live with a dog. We would plan on getting another dog and another cat in the next 5 years or so.

21\) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No practically never unless one of our friends has a human baby for some reason

22\) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Rent yes but no breed or size restrictions 

23\) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Ontario, Canada. Pitbull breeds

24\) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Hot summers , cold winters ( Toronto/New York weather). The dog would need to be able to go on walks in the snow in the cold.

dogs,[BREEDS] Apartment Dog Breed Suggestions," **Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, this will not! Growing up we had labs, and I also had my own dog, a border collie/australian shepherd mix. He was my complete responsibility. It was my job to train him, take him for walks, etc. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

3) Describe your ideal dog.

* My ideal dog is anywhere from 40lbs-80lbs. A dog that can deal with hot temperatures because of where we live (up to 105°f). A dog that does not drool too much, but shedding is not a concern.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My partner and I are fans of sighthounds! Specifically greyhounds and whippets. We’re drawn to them because of their temperament, exercise needs, and we like the size of whippets. We’re unsure how they would do with cats however, and greyhound breeders are difficult to find. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Simple obedience! So heel, sit, stay, down, and recall would be our main priority for training. :]

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Up to two hours a day on average.  My partner and I go for walks and hikes frequently. We will not be using public dog parks, due to bad experiences with them. We’re not opposed to renting out private dog parks for a few hours a week. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large (40lbs-80lbs). My partner is hesitant with anything over 80 pounds. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Any amount of shedding is fine. Some barking is alright, as long as it’s not barking at every little thing. As little drool as possible would be appreciated, but it’s not a complete dealbreaker. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important at all. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* If a dog is straight up aggressive, then no. But willing to manage a reactive dog. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Max five hours a day. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Me and my partner will split caring 50/50. Except for bathing, that’s my job. Their preferences include a dog under 80lbs, little to no drooling, and they do not want a retriever of any kind due to past experiences.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have cats! All are used to dogs and are friendly with them. :)

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We are financially stable (even if we would need thousands for health reasons or would need to move,..), we planned for healthinsurance, dog tax, food,.. for every month and emergencies. 
We know that a dog is a huge responsibility, that’s why we waited that long. We don’t want kids, our jobs and our apartment are secure. We have a lot of family members that offered to watch the dog if we aren’t able to (some of them had/ have dogs so they have the experience). I watched dogs as a teenager and am currently reading books about training. We would go to a doggy school and to a trainer. In germany the term “ESA dog” is not protected under the law so they don’t have more rights than a “normal pet”. 

I got sick 4 years ago and had to stop working last year. My doctors think that I can get healthy again but don’t know when. We are still financially stable, have enough time and energy to care for a dog. The ESA dog would be for me. But if I get healthy again I would take the dog with me to the kids (teach chronically sick children at their home).

dogs,Dog in cabin - long haul flight EU --> US,"Does anyone have any hints and tips for a long haul flight with our dog traveling in the cabin with us?

He meets all proper requirements and has an airline approved travel bag, so that's fine - I'm thinking about things we can do since it's such a long flight and he's going to be bored and anxious for some time without being able to be cuddled (since it's not allowed to bring him out).

When this happens, it is impossible to get it back. He won’t even keep walking. He just lays on the ground and chews the ball and whenever I approach him he runs to a new spot. I’ve tried tempting him with treats and his own ball and nothing seems to work. I basically have to wait until I can catch him.

dogs,16-week-old puppy too late for socialization?,"Hi fam,

I’m considering adopting sporting breed pup from a reputable breeder (CHIC certified parents, lower litter count, strong application process, etc). Here’s the catch: they offered up (and I think I’m excited about) one of their 16 week old doggos. 

The main consideration I have is that I live in a rather urban area (not NYC, but loud cars here and there, lots of people) and the breeder is in a rural area. This will be a first dog for me. I worry that adopting so old in that circumstance, they might not have the socialization opportunities to be comfortable in this environment.

Is this a bad idea?

In some ways it alleviates one of my challenges - parvo isn’t *not* a concern in my area and I live in a condo without a dedicated yard. I had a strategy to solve for that until vaccination (friend yards and a backpack/stroller for socialization). But overall I want to make sure I give a dog an opportunity it needs to feel comfortable in the (urban, busy) environment it’ll be in much of the time for the next few years.

What thoughts do you all have? I know to ask the breeder more about what socialization has been done, but curious what people’s takes are here.

Thanks for the help

The problem is that for unknown reasons she will aggressively pick a fight with other dogs on a random basis. Maybe one dog out of ten or fifteen we meet on the trails. She and most of the other dogs are off-leash. The only solution is to keep her leashed, but that's the end of  her exercise. Any suggestions on how to get her the high intensity exercise she needs without riding and running? (I am not a runner).

dogs,Walking two dogs with different paces.,"Hi fellow dog lovers, have a quick question. The gist of it is, I'll be helping a relative dogsit next week. Their dog is an older dog who has mobilty issues and can't walk too fast or far. My own dog walks much faster and likes going on longer walks.

I have dogsit before so both dogs are familiar and friendly with each other. I would also usually have someone else with me and we'll take one each to handle the different paces, but I'll be alone this time. So the question is, what's the best way to handle both dogs without compromising them?

Should I just wake up earlier and bring them both on separate walks? Do I just wait for the older dog and take breaks in between? My relative has a stroller for the dog as well. Should I use that to push the older dog when it gets tired? Although I'm worried about having to handle two dogs and stroller on my own in this case.",1729177826.0
dogs,Looking for Breed recommendations for my own pup!,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I've lived with and cared for family dogs (Labrador retrievers) all my life, and now in my early adulthood I'm looking to add my own pup to my life. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Due to health and breed concerns, I'm a little more interested in seeking a dog through a reputable breeder, but if the right shelter dog fits the bill I'd love to adopt.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* A mid-energy dog of medium or large size. I'm only 5ft tall and work full time, so I would prefer to avoid high-energy, very large breeds. I'd look for a dog I can take on outings to the parks or friends spaces, or be comfortable having an in-day with!

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I've become increasingly interested in getting a corgi dog due to their size and popularity (and they're adorable!). The Shiba Inu has peaked my interest as well for similar reasons. I've always had labradors my whole life, so I am a big fan of retrievers as well.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Leash training and socialization are a must, as I'm looking for a dog I can take places and meet other people/animals and not have to fear them lashing out or attempting to hide. Basic commands are planned as well, and maybe crate training.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No interest in competition or work.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Anytime outside of regular work hours I plan to be ready to commit to my dog if needed. Due to full-time work hours, I am also considering daytime dog care or training options.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-3 hours daily on average, both in home and external locations like the park. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am willing to groom at home as well as bring to a professional, but I'm not too thrilled of the idea of a breed that is high-maintenance in terms of grooming beyond the regular brushing, cleaning, and trimming.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large, but small could be considered. On the other end, as much as I adore larger dogs, I am pretty short and fear lacking the ability to move a bigger dog in an emergency.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I'm not too picky in terms of shedding or barking! Slobber is tolerable to a certain amount.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Unnecessary, I'd rather have them leashed unless the area is fenced.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly Velcro dogs are my favorite.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More toward the eager-to-please side of things, but I could use some time to myself where my dog could keep busy on its own.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Barking is probably preferred in this scenario, but once strangers and visitors are introduced I'd look for friendliness from my dog.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Preferably no.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I keep lizards as pets as well, and while they primarily remain in their enclosures, I'd prefer my dog to not have a prey drive so strong they try to get at my lizards.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Three days a week, during work hours (8 hours) at the maximum. I plan to look into daytime dog care like training camp or dog walkers for those days.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live with my sister, who is also fully prepared to help in caring for the dog, with similar preferences to my own.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* As mentioned above, I keep pet lizards as well, but I hope them to not be much of a problem to having a dog. There's the chance of an additional dog or a cat later on.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not regularly, but I'd like them to be friendly with children.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* He used to breed Dobbermans. We had a few mutts while I was growing up but none in the last 20 years

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Slightly favoring a breeder at this point but i don't have much knowledge on the issue.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* He lives on the old family homestead. So we have plenty of area. However Mother wants the dog to go to work with him so that is a limiting factor. Its about a 30 minute drive each way. Just him and two other employees at the store. (He owns the business so no issues about the dog being there) So something that wont mind the travel 4 days out of the week.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I have been looking at Terriers and Corgis mostly. They seems like medium to low maintenance dogs while being excellent companions.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just general obedience

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* This is a difficult question as I'm not really sure. He has few hobbies, mostly working in his shop durring his off time. But he is getting older (72 now) and is being less able to do his hobbies. This is partly to address that.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* We are rural (Though expansion of the nearby city is making us increasingly suburb.) so no dog park.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'm not certain on this.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Probably Small size

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I would guess low on most of these.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Pretty important. The area has a lot of nearby woods

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Either is fine.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either is fine.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* He doesn't get many visitors often at home, but would have people constantly coming into the store.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I doubt it will run into many other dogs.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Not that I can think of off hand.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

About once or twice a week. Likely alone for a couple of hours. (Sunday church and Wednesday night service.)

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Mother wants the dog to be simple and easy to maintain as she does most of the housework. (Much to our complaints and offers to help) She often works on cakes putting many hours into each one. They are on high countertops so I don't think it would be much of an issue but I would have peace of mind if the dog wasn't interested in them. Dad rarely travels so it should be with him mostly.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* No

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Possibly? But not for years. I am looking to married and start a family but I'm not even dating at the moment.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Own the house. Not looking to move.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Statesville, NC. No laws against breeds
* What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
* Pretty moderate all told. 70-80 F in the summer few weeks probably in the 90s.  40s typically in the winter with some weeks lower.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Nothing I can think of at this time.

dogs,DIY Solution to Winterize Dog Door? ,"TL;DR - I'm looking for suggestions on how to keep the draft to a minimum in winter from the dog door. The dogs are a German Husky mix and a Dark Nose Cur that's not like a tank. 

We live in the Northeast US, and we had a $1200 JeldWen patio sliding door installed with a built-in large dog door, with the opening facing the windward side of the housr. It worked great until the plastic flap deteriorated a year later. It took a month back and forth with customer service to be allowed to purchase a replacement, which again only lasted a year. I can't attach an image but imagine a sliding patio door with a mini window you can open at the bottom. So i can't exactly use any other off the shelf products. What I have now is a makeshift wooden tunnel in front of the door with a makeshift exterior flap made out of a heavy rubber door mat. On the actual opening I have two strips of fur fabric attached to the door sill. Any ideas on material to use/methods?",1729171283.0
dogs,Is a Poodle a Good Fit?,"I love the personality of Golden’s but they wouldn’t be a good match for us due to their size, hair, and energy. I’m leaning heavily towards FCI Moyen Poodles (European Imported parents) due to their size, hair, and intelligence. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

	•	I’ve grown up with dogs and currently have a small terrier.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

	•	Would love to go through a breeder to avoid hidden temperament issues. I know temperament isn’t guaranteed with breeds, but rescues may need more work due to trauma.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

	•	A snuggly, quiet dog, who is equally excited to go for hikes as they are to spend time curled up next to me on the couch. A dog that’s good with all people and other dogs. Either a low prey drive so it doesn’t tug or get distracted on walks, or can be easily trained to ignore distractions. Our terrier currently has really high prey drive and doesn’t stop barking/pulling when it sees another animal. Would love it if the dog is calm in these circumstances. Bonus points if the dog is low shedding and likes to learn new tricks. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

	•	I’m open to suggestions! I’m leaning heavily towards FCI Moyen poodles since they don’t shed, are athletic enough to take on hikes, but have an off switch. They seem like the sweet spot in size since Standards are too big and Miniatures are a tad small.  I have always adored the personality of a golden retriever, but it’s hard to get past the thought of hair everywhere, their size, and their common health issues. If there was such a thing as a Golden Retriever with medium energy, better health, and little to no shedding I would get one in a heartbeat. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

	•	Basic obedience - heel, sit, and walk on a leash. Nothing crazy. It’d be really cool if the dog was able to ride in a trailer towed behind my bike. Would be great if the dog makes me feel like a genius, but not necessary.

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

	•	No intention on showing/sporting

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

	•	Around 2 hours a day. It will get 1 hour of walks, some play time, and lots of attention throughout the day. I WFH so the dog won’t be alone much.

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

	•	1 hour of walks each day and small bits of playtime. I’ll give the dog puzzles and other things so its brain will be stimulated. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

	•	Yes - can pay or do it myself. I’d be open to learning how to at home and if it doesn’t go as planned we can pay for grooming. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?
     
       20-40lbs

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

	•	All in moderation - I don’t mind a little of each, but would really like minimal amounts. I like the idea of a poodle since they don’t leave mounds of hair everywhere. I don’t mind some barking, but would love a relatively quiet dog. Alert barking is okay, but not a huge fan of barking in general. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

	•	Not important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
	•	 Snuggly dogs are the best - would love one that wants to sit next to me (or on me) and soak up all the pets. 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

	•	I would love one that’s eager to please

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

	•	It’d be great if the dog was relatively quiet when someone knocked on the door. An alert bark or two I wouldn’t mind, but I’m not a huge fan of loud incessant barking. I would love the dog to be friendly towards strangers. Either reserved but not anxious, or wagging its tail and walking up to them like they’re his best friend. Jumping would not be good - I have small nieces and nephews and elderly relatives that might get knocked over easily.

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

	•	That wouldn’t be ideal since we have a smaller terrier that’s getting older. I would love for the dog to either be indifferent to other dogs or friendly. Reactivity definitely makes a lot of things more difficult.

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

	•	Neuroticism
	•	Aggression
	•	Excessive barking
	•	Heavy Leash pulling

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

	•	I work from home so the dog won’t be left alone for more than a few hours each week. Might be gone for 4-5 hours 2-3 times a week, but aside from that my wife or I will be home. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

	•	Wife and I will tag team walking, training, and feeding the dog. My wife prefers a dog that she can manage on walks (she’s tiny)
	•	My wife loves the looks of Poodles in a Teddy Bear cut

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

	•	We have a small 12lb Norfolk Terrier. She’s good with other dogs and people, but is reserved if a dog wants to play with her. 

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

	•	Yes, we have family with young kids and a plan to have our own in the future

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

	•	We rent an apartment - not sure on policy since we are moving

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

	•	not aware of bans on dogs where we live

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: 75-95 degrees F in the summer
Winter is between 40 and 70 F

**Additional Information and Questions**

25)	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.


26)	Feel free to ask any questions below.

	•	If an American breeder has imported FCI Moyen Poodles as Sire and Dam, is the breeder still seen as reputable? 
	•	Are there any breeds I should also be aware of?

We just picked up a little two year old Chihuahua from the shelter. He knows nothing, but seems to be way more toy motivated then food, and  the smallest Kong I can get is too small and he's picky about food and treats in general. 

Anyone have some great puzzle toys for a 5lb dog? He loves squeaky and crinkle toys so far, but even the small ones I got are too big for him to squeak on his own.

dogs,Dog started refusing morning walks,"Our 3yo Bichon Frise, who has always enjoyed long morning walks (30-45 mins on weekdays and 1.5-2 hours on weekends), has recently started refusing them. Since I got pregnant, my activity level has decreased, and our morning walks have shortened to about 20 mins on weekdays and 45 mins on weekends. I also started working from the office, leaving less time for walks on weekdays.

Since then his behavior has changed significantly: he's more whiny, begs for attention, pulls on walks, and is stubborn about the direction he wants to walk in. We're trying mental enrichment at home, but it only helps a little. More notably, he often refuses to leave the driveway for morning walks, happily following me back inside instead. If we skip the morning walk, he stays home alone all day without going outside until the evening walk.

Despite this, he eats, plays, and takes evening walks as usual, showing excitement for those. Should I just ignore this change in behavior? It’s like in the mornings he says “meh, these crappy walks are not even worth getting out of bed for”.",1729096469.0

After baby arrived it’s just been a struggle. He was up and about, walking and everything. She gets extremely uncomfortable and has shown warnings so we keep them separated while baby is playing on the floor. When he’s not, the dog can come in And relax with us. I feel awful for keeping her separated but it’s the best option we have until the baby gets older and can understand her boundaries more.  This situation hasn’t helped my feelings of impatience with her.

* We live in an apartment, so I'd like a dog that doesn't bark much. Also, we have cats, so I'd prefer a breed with smaller prey-drive (I don't mind if they are not friends as long as the dog isn't chasing the cats all the time). I know look shouldn't matter, but I don't like dogs with very short muzzle, like Pekingese or pugs.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I was considering a Shiba inu, but I'd like a breed that is more eager-to-please. I don't mind if it's not the most eager-to-please breed as long as it's not a cat in disguise. I was also considering a Collie. We had a Collie when I was a child and she was the most loving, patient dog I've ever met, but I'm considered about barking.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just general obedience

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Probably two times one hour on workdays for walking (maybe also jogging, but it's not a must). Unfortunately, dog park is only possible in the weekends.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Not important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, cats

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

dogs,Dog doesn’t like ANYTHING I’m at my wits end ,"I’m at my wits end. I adopted a GSD mutt 6 months ago. She seems miserable despite my best efforts to make her happy. 

The ONLY time she seems happy is on walks (more specifically, walks in new places. The same old loop around my neighborhood has gotten meh. She doesn’t stop to sniff anything anymore or really look around at all she just seems like she’s on autopilot trying to get the walk over with. In new places she comes alive, wagging her tail, sniffing everything, head on a swivel looking around.

In the house she just lays in the ground death staring me or restlessly paces around whining. When I look at her she whines. Occasionally she comes to sit by me and whines at me and wacks me with her paws even while I’m actively petting her - it doesn’t seem to make her happy or be enough. Her tail doesn’t wag, her ears are back. 

I’ve bought countless dog puzzles, snuffle mats, lick mats, toys of all sorts. She has zero interest. She is extremely picky with food and treats, but even the treats she likes she doesn’t actually want if she has to work for them (like by trying to play hide and seek type games with the treats). She will occasionally bite a squeaker toy and then walk away, she never truly plays at all, even if I try really hard to hype her up. Zero interest in fetch. She will eat some chews but won’t touch the long lasting ones (and I have tried tons) so at most they occupy her for 2 minutes at a time. She doesn’t touch stuffed kongs or anything that makes it a little harder for her to get the food, even food she likes ordinarily. 

We do tricks/training for a few minutes a day, which she seems to do reluctantly given she isn’t super treat motivated. 

The vet says she is in great physical health. I’ve considered asking them for an antidepressant or something but I know I wouldn’t be able to get her to take a pill with how picky she is. 

We are walking an average of 6 miles a day spread out over 4 walks, so she does get outside quite a bit but she still seems miserable. 

She just seems very unhappy, bored and whiny. Is there anything I haven’t thought of? any suggestions? I feel like a terrible dog owner that my dog is so unhappy but I’m at my wits end. ",1729047894.0

dogs,[Breeds] Recommended breeds for first time dog owner,"**Introduction**

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes this will be my first dog on my own. I grew up my whole life with German Shepherd dogs though and have experience with caring for them on my own (albeit on a short term basis)

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
* No

3)Describe your ideal dog.

* Single guy with no kids, looking for a medium to large sized dog (50-100 lbs). Looking for an affectionate companion that I can take and enjoy exploring with (dog parks, hikes, breweries, etc), so must be friendly around people and other dogs. I also live by myself and work from an office. I have flexibility to work from home and come home for lunch breaks. But living by myself the dog will sometimes need to be home by itself for up to 8 hours, especially once we are settled into a routine.  

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Was mainly looking into labs, retreivers, along with smaller Great Pyrenees and Bernese Mountain Dogs. I am not married to these breeds though

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience commands, Go for rides in the car and go on hikes. People and other dog friendly

* No

**Care Commitments**

7)How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Outside of work I have lots of free time at home that I can devote. We can go for a morning walk each day, plus can take the dog on an additional walk or to the dog park after work. 

8)How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* On average I would say 90 minutes a day. Plus on the weekends occassionally go on hikes (doesn't have to be difficult) or to a dog park to run around. 

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I don't mind doing all of this, but also willing to pay a professional if neccessary. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)What size dog are you looking for?

* 50 - 100 lbs

11)How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I don't mind shedding at all and slobber I can handle. Barking is ok but I'd like to be able to let the dog out in my back yard (fenced in) without constant barking at the neighbors dogs.

12)How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I don't have a huge backyard, so I would like to be able to take the dog to the park and play fetch and let them run around. This isn't a deal breaker though. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I don't mind either. Preferably snuggly though. 

14)Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

15)How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't mind if the dog barks if someone comes to the door or enters the yard. That was a common occurrence growing up with dogs so I am used to it. Would prefer if the dog could at least be taught to not jump on strangers. 

16)Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I would prefer not too

17)Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Not having a dog that is prone to separation anxiety is a big one. Also I don't want a dog that is on the extreme high energy side. My sister has an Australian Shepherd that is a bit overwhelming to take care of. 

**Lifestyle**

18)How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Answered above, but ideally the dog will need to be left alone for up to 8 hours a day on weekdays. I have flexibility to work from home or go home lunch breaks, though. Also willing to hire a dog walker or take the dog to day care some days as well.

dogs,How do you tire out your high drive dog?,"Hey everyone!
A bit of backstory: we got our girl as a puppy from the shelter around four years ago. Everyone, including the shelter, was positive that she was a rough collie mix. I thought fine, Collies aren’t really that high energy/drive dogs. Jokes on me: turns out she has strong percentages of Bohemian Shepherd and Malinois in her. The Collie part apparently is only in appearance lol. 
I’m running out of ideas on how to keep her happy. Our routine so far is:
-Three walks a day, an hour each time. During these we walks we do:
-Impulse control training, scent training, play fetch and repeat commands.

At home I have some intelligence toys for her. We also (though not as frequently as we should) try ‘calm training’, e.g just sit outside on a bench for ten minutes and watch people and dogs go by. 

I’m really running out of ideas here, because she still seems very underwhelmed at home.  

Also, I’d like to teach her some ‘useful’ every day commands, such as stopping at crosswalks etc.

dogs,"[Breeds] Recommendations would be helpful, thank you!","\*\*Introduction\*\*

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* Not my first dog, currently own a English Cocker Spaniel/Cavalier King Charles Spaniel cross. She's a very good girl.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

\* I would prefer to go through a reputable breeder as I prefer the extra certainty you get in the genetic characteristics of the dog, as well as the knowledge of exactly where the dog came from.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

\* Active breeds with biddable natures. I would like to practise agility and obedience with the dog, eventually retiring it into a less active, but still mentally challenging activity, ideally scentwork. I would prefer a larger dog, with my preferred limit being around 26 inches at the withers, but will consider breeds up to 30 inches.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* White Swiss Shepherd, Samoyed, Collie (Rough or Smooth).

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Agility, Obedience, Games such as fetch, eventually scentwork.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* I probably won't compete with the dog, but I would like to train agility and obedience anyway as activities for physical and mental stimulation.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* It's difficult to quantify exactly how much time, but the dog would be my main use of time, other than work. I plan on walking and playing fetch in the mornings to provide physical exercise, then another, longer, more engaging, walk later in the day. On days with extra time, I will be taking the dog for hikes, or setting up the agility set in a park.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* When taking into account morning and afternoon walks, as well as vigorous play, I hope to provide an average of 2 hours daily. There are two park areas I will be regularly walking the dog. People do bring their dogs to these parks, but I have walked my previous dog in both, and never experienced issues with mishandled dogs.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* I am open to regular brushing if required. I am less confident with trimming hair. I can definitely clean ears and give occasional baths. We currently have a trusted groomer that services our other dog.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)What size dog are you looking for?

\* Larger breeds, with a preferred maximum of 26"" at the withers. I will consider breeds up to 30"", but I would not like to go below 20"".

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* I am fine with shedding. Our current dog sheds a ton. I understand that most dogs bark, I am willing to engage in training to reduce this. I don't like slobber and would prefer minimal drool.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* I would prefer a breed with low wanderlust and good recall. I am willing to invest a lot of time in training recall in order to be able to let the dog off-leash.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behaviour\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* I would prefer an affectionate dog.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* A biddable breed would be preferable, although dogs are not machines, so a breed with a stubborn streak that can be minimised with good training is not out of the question.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* Preferably indifference, but I understand this is a function of training, rather than breed. I will be training against any guarding tendencies. I would prefer the dog greet strangers with either polite indifference, or friendliness. I will be training the dog in this direction regardless, so more boisterous, friendly breeds are also welcome for consideration.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* I would prefer not to deal with dog aggression.

17) Are there any other behaviours you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* I do not want a breed that tends to be aloof with it's owners.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* There will be someone at home most of the time. Schedules will occasionally line up in such a way that the dog may have to stay home for a few hours alone. I intend to train the dog to deal with separation anxiety, if possible.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* Other people in the house have few preferences. They tend to accept or reject option on a breed by breed basis, so I will just have to suggest whatever breed is recommended to them and see what they say. They will be minorly involved in training the dog. Mostly reinforcing training in how they interact with the dog. I will be caring for most of the dogs needs.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* I currently have a English Cocker Spaniel/Cavalier King Charles Spaniel mix. However, I do not plan on acquiring the dog until the aforementioned passes.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No, but I would like the dog to be good with children.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* No.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* I live in the UK, there are several banned breeds here, but I am not interested in any breeds bred for guarding.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summer temperatures rarely break 30c and winters rarely go below -5c. Averages are probably between 5c-15c

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* As mentioned before, this dog and the current one I have will not be living together.

dogs,How to enrich a room for a new puppy?,"I got a husky puppy last Thursday and on the Friday whilst I was at work she got out and I had to go get her back from the people that found her. Thus until I am certain she can't escape the back yard she is currently locked in my spare room.

I have an older dog who has free reign of the house and backyard. I don't like that they'll be separated, but it's the current situation at hand.

I have so far set up a bunch of toys, chew toys, a snuffle ball, a squeaky ball, a dried fish to chew on. She has a radio going, access to water, and a puppy pad for toileting (not that I care if she finds a different spot). 

What else can I do?",1728858043.0
dogs,Breed recommendation,"**Introduction**

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I had multiple dogs when I was younger (family dogs mostly, until I left home around 17). We had mixed ruts, a poodle, and a German shepherd and lived in a rural area, so I don't have experience in an apartment/city. Most dogs were trained at home, but I went with the GW to professional training as it was a rescue with a high prey drive. She was perfect after. I also have a lot of experience training horses, stubborn donkeys and even cats! My wife doesn't have any experience although and I would like it to be a shared experience, so find a dog that is not too hard to start.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I'm ok with both, my wife is more reluctant about rescuing as she feels it's harder to find a specific breed. All my animals have been rescued.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

* medium-sized, affectionate while being independent / cat-like. Silly, not too barky (apartment situation), tendencies to be a couch potato but happy to go outside with us for a hike. Nice with cats, potty-trained already.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Silken windhound : They seem like silly noodles with a graceful personality, I do think they match a lot of the boxes for us except for cats (prey drive), but I had a good review about that with people buying them from breeders with cats. Keeshound are a close one too, except for their barking, but it can be from one to another. My wife likes Shiba and Akita Inu, but I think it would frustrate her a lot as a first dog lol.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Go for hikes and runs, be ok on car drives, enjoy time with us at home and be silly at times. Our cat loves dogs if they are chill and calm, it would be nice if they could go along too!

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* nope, mostly family dog, but with no kids.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I already get our cat on a leash outside every morning (30min), I run 3x to 5x a week (45min to 1h, but slow runs like 7 to 8km), we have parks and dog parks around, we usually go outside 2h per day or more, and I have a lot of free time at home for playing and training depending on the type of dog. So an easy 4 to 5h a day overall on weekdays and way much on weekends.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly, and does that include using a dog park?

* This has been mostly answered above, I'll just add that on the weekends we often go hiking (no very hard hikes, but still between 3 to 6h). We can give plenty of mental and physical stimulation, although our activities are mostly calm ones. We also love camping in wild areas!

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'd be very happy to do all of this, the cat is long-haired and already have her brushing sessions. As for grooming, I used to do it a lot for my poodle but I'd be happy to have a professional if needed. All my animals were trained to be fine with grooming which resulted mostly in a SPA moment for them.

**Personal Preferences**

10)What size dog are you looking for?

* medium, it's hard to have big dog in Quebec because of the landlords. I want a dog big enough to go on hikes but small enough not to dissuade our landlord.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Very ok with shedding, less with drooling and not so much with barking as we are in an apartment. (Although on the first floor so nobody under us)

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be really nice, but tbh there are not a lot of places like that in Quebec too. I sure prefer a close to perfect recall though.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* We like both, I find it harder when they have separation anxiety.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* A just middle would be perfect.

1. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* I would prefer them to not bark inside too much, I'd like them to not jump on people but not be aggressive. They don't have to like everyone.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Not so much.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Being territorial with us or aggressive to other. Being too prey oriented, separation anxiety prone to destruction. too high level energy and termite-like munching on everything.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* My wife and I both have flexible works so we can be at home when the other is at work. It could happen that they are alone for 4h to 6h as the bigger stretch but it will be exceptional, usually we will have a friend around.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* There is just my wife and my cat, they both like calm dogs that don't jump on them, are easy to be around and don't knock things over.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Just the cat for now.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We run a large apartment with big open spaces on the first floor in Quebec city. There is no direct restriction, dogs are allowed but I have to talk first with the landlord about the kind of dog I'd like to have to make my case.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Quebec

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* up to 30C in the summer, but mostly around 22C. Down to -40C in the winter but mostly around -15C I'd say. We see little whippets in the winter, might not be their cup of tea but they do well!

But in the meantime vet prescribed him muscle relaxers and a steroid for inflammation. He said no jumping, running or walking but now my dog seems restless because I've had him take it easy for about a week and half with no real exercise. He's used to being very active and getting tired out. Now he's just acting like he wants to play and can't sit still. It's kind of annoying, I know it's because he has so much energy built up but is supposed to take it easy. What can I do to help him?  I use his Kong toys but seems like he is getting bored of them.

dogs,Breed for me?,"**Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. I had a Miniature Schnauzer that had to be put down due to aggression. He would fly into rages and bite with no provocation.  I worked with two different trainers and a canine behaviorist without ever being able to get on top of it. He was a puppy mill dog (a relatively nice mill, but still a mill) so I think that he had a genetic tendency to aggression. I suppose it’s also possible that he had been abused before I got him at eight weeks. It broke my heart, but I opted to have him put to sleep after multiple bite incidents and years of living on pins and needles. It’s been twelve years since then, and I’m only now feeling ready to have a dog again

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

No.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

Happy and outgoing. Loves everybody. Enjoys cuddle time but can chill when I’m busy. Good with children. (I homeschool for a family with four children and would love to take my dog to work with me.) Relatively low energy but loves a good walk. Small (under 20 pounds) without being too fragile. Has a coat I can maintain at home. From a generally healthy breed. Easy to train. Low prey drive (I have birds).

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Havanese, Tibetan Spaniel, Shih Tzu, English Toy Spaniel, and Japanese Chin are at the top of my list. I think they come the closest to matching my ideal dog, though each breed misses some areas. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels look like the perfect match on paper, but I’m very concerned about the health issues in the breed.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

A few tricks could be fun, but I just want a well-mannered companion.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Up to two hours of focused training, walking, and grooming.  But I would expect to be interacting with the dog all day and would certainly be happy to add in extra play time.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Up to an hour of walk time, split over two or three sessions. I plan on primarily walking my dog, plus play time. No to dog parks – I live in a rural area and there aren’t any close.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am happy to brush every day if needed. I can do basic grooming at home. I doubt I’m up to giving a dog a haircut, though. I’d prefer to avoid going to a groomer but would be willing to if my perfect dog needs regular clipping.

 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Preferably under 20 pounds.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

No drooling, please! Moderate shedding is fine, and I don’t mind some barking, if it isn’t constant.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It would be nice, but not a priority.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Some of both? I do want some snuggle time, but I don’t want a dog that will constantly pester me for attention. I wouldn’t mind my dog lying quietly on my lap or beside me while I work, but I’d hate to have to keep stopping to interact with it.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

More eager-to-please.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

With a wagging tail! I also don’t mind a more reserved dog, if it isn’t at all aggressive. I’m pretty scarred from my past experience, so I’m trying to stack the deck in my favor with a dog that loves everyone.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Any hint of aggression toward people.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Two or three hours a couple of times per week. I plan to take my dog to work with me, plus, I live with my retired parents, so someone is almost always at home.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

I will be the dog’s caregiver. My father would probably enjoy any well-mannered dog. My mother would prefer a dog that can chill out and not be constantly pestering her for attention.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

I have budgies. They spend several hours each day out of their cage, so prey drive is a big concern.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes. My niblings are in and out of the house frequently, plus I’d like to take my dog to work with me (I homeschool for a family). All the children are used to interacting with dogs and are good with them.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Not applicable.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Virginia, USA, no breed restrictions.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: mid-eighties to nineties F (low to mid-thirties C)

Winter: mid-forties F (around 7 C)

dogs,How to make urine problems more manageable while searching for a root cause?,"Adopted a dog a year ago from a local shelter. All they could tell us was that she had had a large liter of puppies prior to being surrendered to Animal Control. Her surrender paperwork said she was 4, but our vet estimated she was closer to 2. So as of today, she's likely somewhere between 3 and 5ish years old. We know nothing else about this dog's background or how she might have lived.

The thing we're struggling with is her peeing in her crate, particularly if we go out for the evening, and how to have it be less messy to deal with while we sort out any medical issues.

Let me be clear that we are working with our vet to address any medical issues. She's been treated for a UTI twice. Our vet also had us try Proin during her last UTI treatment. I am and will continue to see if there are medical things we can address to help her.

But in the meantime, it's really frustrating to come home after a few hours out at night and have to give her a bath and set the crate outside to be cleaned in the morning. If I put a soft bed in the crate, she'll chew it. If I put anything like blankets, I just add to what needs to be cleaned the next day. I thought maybe being in a slightly smaller crate might help her not want to pee in the space she has to lay, but that hasn't helped. She is crated when we leave the house because she's had a number of incidents of inappropriate chewing and we can't trust she won't pee in the house when left unsupervised (so this isn't just a crate issue). It is guaranteed if we leave the house in the evening, she will pee in her crate.

While we continue to work through any medical issues, and continue general housetraining while we're home, I could really use some ideas to try and make this more manageable while we find an actual solution to whatever is causing her to not be able to hold her pee in the evening. Last night we were only gone for 3 hours and her crate was a mess when we got home. I felt awful having to scramble to give her a bath close to bed time (but I am so thankful she is easy to bathe!). 

At what point do you try dog diapers? Maybe a raised bed in a larger crate with some pee pads on the floor of the crate? I'd really appreciate any suggestions or ideas.",1728697918.0

Thanks in advance!",1728681819.0
dogs,Is it okay to use breeders if you want a specific dog breed? ,"I know that breeding is usually unethical and that if you want a dog, you should go to a shelter and adopt one there, or look into rescues and whatnot rather than funding the breeding business.

dogs,Conflicted on getting another dog,"I currently have one dog (2YR Male). My mom and I dote on him a lot, but now that I've started working and doing school I'm really not home as much. My mom also works a full shift so he's pretty much by himself until I get back from school at 1 PM. Everytime I check on him via the pet cam, he looks so sad. It really breaks my heart. We live with a relative who also has two dogs (9YR Female and 2 YR Male), but the way they play with him isn't really fair or safe in my opinion. They both gang up on him at the same time and overwhelm him pretty quickly. They're also WAY bigger than him. There have never been any accidents or injuries, but I really don't think it's fair for him. 

My mom and I have been talking about getting another dog to keep him company and also she just wants another dog. However, my main concern is the amount of time and effort I'd have to put into training a dog, not to mention its double the food, double the vet bills if necessary, double the grooming bills and I'd be doing all of it myself since she wants no part in training the pup. I also don't think there would be enough space for four dogs in our house. In addition, my mom thinks the new dog should be a girl. It was already in the plans to neuter our current dog, but then we’d have to spay the girl and that’s not cheap. Our house is big, but it's very chaotic having a bunch of high energy dogs in one space. On the other hand, I do enjoy animals and I do want my dog to not feel so lonely while I'm gone. What should I do?

EDIT: Hi everyone! Thanks for your insight. I've decided not to get the second dog and have instead opted to put in more focus on improving the play dynamic between the three dogs. When I came back from work today, I decided to test something and have only the two boys play together outside while the other stayed inside. The way they played was really different from what I have observed when the nine-year old was involved. Then, I let her out to join them and the typical roughhousing started up. I'm going to put in a lot of effort in to see how I can teach her how to play a bit nicer. Thanks again everybody! ",1728659542.0

She’s never fought about it before, but she snapped and bit onto our older dog. There’s no serious injuries on her, but now she’s so scared she barely leaves my parents room. Neither of the dogs are puppies. Our younger is a belgian shepherd with serious anxiety issues and our older is a pit lab pointer mix. The belgian regularly tries to follow around our pit mix and because of that, it’s making our pit mix even more stressed. She peed the bed and pooped in the house yesterday.

He's an older boy and he loves to chew, with the caveat that he doesn't like to chew on toys or actual bones. The plus side is he also does not want to chew on stuff he shouldn't either. But...

the only things he likes to chew on are:

Sticks (but must be small, almost a twig)

bully sticks

and nylabone healthy edibles bones

And the worst part is he chews them in minutes. He would eat a hundred a day.

I have him getting just one bully stick or nylabone per day, but even that is so expensive. The only other treats he likes (besides freeze dried chicken) are these Bark Bakery faux chocolate chips cookies that are also expensive. And I have tried EVERYTHING.

Has anyone tried to make their own version? I googled but can't find a recipe. The ingredient list doesn't seem crazy but any attempts I have done to make them doesn't result in the right crunchy texture. I don't want him eating actual sticks either.

dogs,Ethical Breeding Questions,"  I have seen a lot content online recently about ethical, responsible dog breeding. I’m super intrigued because it sounds fantastic and a great way to ensure that dogs are cared for properly. I have a couple of questions about some things I didn’t totally understand, though.    

   First, a lot of people talking about this seem to be very focused on large breed dogs. I’ve see a lot of content from dog trainers and people involved in dog sports, who have breeds like Malinois, German Shepards, Retrievers, etc. I think it might be skewing the kind of information I’m receiving about ethical breeders. Are there ethical breeders  of medium and small dog breeds out there? Or is this a  sporting/herding group thing?  
     
   Second, (and probably related to my first question) I’ve seen people talk about breeders “proving” their dogs with sports, shows, jobs, etc. If someone was breeding a dog breed used primarily as a companion like a toy breed, how would they prove that dog? Would they have to show it? Or are their other ways? Am I misunderstanding this?   
      
   Also, if you are someone with a love of a breed but not personally interested in dog sports or showing your dogs, could you ever get into ethical breeding? For instance, if you really have a passion for animal husbandry and preservation of historic and rare breeds, but not for like, agility or hunting. This is hypothetical, please don’t come for me.   
       
   Forgive me if this is the wrong community to ask in, or if I am missing/misunderstanding some information about this! I am genuinely just curious and want to learn. If anyone knows of trustworthy resources where I can learn more, I would love recommendations too!

dogs,Breed Questionnaire!,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
   * Yes *my* first dog but I have grown up with Dogs all my life and I have been doing dog sitting for about a year now looking after many different dogs with varying personalities and needs from bubbly puppies and helping keep training in line to elderly dogs that I had to help poop and even nervous dogs that usually hate new people that I have won over :)
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
   * I could definitely deal with getting a rescue but I would like a puppy so I can start from scratch with it and so I have a longer term buddy.
3. Describe your ideal dog.
   * Loves a walk (but only needs one or two a day - thanks work life balance...), good with other dogs so they can be mates with my mum and neighbours dogs (needs to be part of the gang) and not very vocal at all (I live in a flat/apartment and dont like being a noisy neighbour)
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
   * Retrievers and Cockapoos seem to be a great fit but I am fairly agnostic. I know what I dont like more than what I do like - which is why I'm doing this post...
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
   * Dont have to do all the tricks in the book, I'm happy with the basics and having good recall so I can trust the dog out on walks.
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
   * Nope

**Care Commitments**

1. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
   * I work from home so can commit to 1 or 2 walks a day depending on schedule and will spend all day with them in the house and can often be away from my desk when they need some attention but I would appreciate being able to get on with work during the day. Typical day would be 7am walk 45min to an hour, get my head down in the morning, lunchtime walk 30 to 45mins and then can give some attention in the afternoon and chill in the evening.
2. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
   * I live very close to a good place to walk, the end of the road is an entrance to the local woods and there are lots of people walking dogs there often. Typical day will have 2 walks here resulting in around 1.5hrs of walking a day.
3. How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
   * I wouldnt mind brushing weekly but I dont want to have too much to do on this front. I know a local groomer and would consider taking the dog regularly but would prefer to have less grooming to do than otherwise.

**Personal Preferences**

1. What size dog are you looking for?
   * Medium. Cockapoo/Collie seems to be the perfect size for me, I like to be able to pick the dog up for a cuddle but I dont like small dogs as much.
2. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
   * Dont mind shedding, less is a bonus but shedding isnt a deal breaker. Barking I really wanna avoid, I hate being the neighbour with a noisy dog and live somewhere with a loud front door right by my living room with people coming and going from other flats/apartments, I would hate having a dog that barked every time someone else left the building. Slobber I dislike but a little bit isnt a dealbreaker.
3. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
   * I always do this out on walks, I even trust dogs where their owners dont and they get on great with me as I keep control still. But thats it really, otherwise will be out in the garden or in the house, I dont have some big plot of land they will be running around on.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

1. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
   * Love cuddles but dont like the dog to be needy like begging for attention.
2. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
   * In the middle on this one. I feel like if I want a cuddly dog they will be on the eager-to-please spectrum by default tho?
3. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
   * Friendlyness on this front is important. Can understand the odd bark when there is a knock at the door but dont want a very vocal dog.
4. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
   * No - and this is a must. I live close to my Mum and would want to walk the dog with hers and take it over to her house often as well as be able to be walked with my neighbours dog who I already walk a couple times a week.
5. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
   * Eating poo! I hate this but could probably deal with it ok... it just makes me feel ill thinking about it haha. Chewing is also something I dislike in a dog, I hate being worried about my stuff around the house.

**Lifestyle**

1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
   * Not often at all. I work from home and would make sure I can take the dog with me when I go out or leave it with someone when I can't
2. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
   * Just me. I would maybe leave it with my mum or get my sister to help out sometimes but they get no say in what breed I get >:)
3. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
   * The people above me have Cats, thats about it and I would want the cats to get to know the dog and be friends if possible, otherwise we would just avoid them (which is what I have been doing with about 95% success with all the dog sitting I have done this year)
4. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
   * No but I like a dog that is good on this front, good personality trait in my opinion.
5. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
   * I rent but no restrictions by weight (I guess this is an american thing? I also have a really chill landlord so maybe its just me)
6. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
   * UK banned breeds (its ok I dont like them anyway) - American Pit Bulls, XL Bully, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino, Fila Braziliero
7. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
   * Summer is mid-20s and winder gets down to around freezing but mostly low 10s. (Degrees C)

Other notes:

* I dislike dogs that have weird fashionable breeding characteristics and dont really want a small dog. I like a proper dog with a typical shape snout and body. Really short legs or a scrunched up face they cant breathe through are really ugly to me. I have a bias towards how a collie looks (my first dog as a kid was a collie cross) but I'm not sure I would be able to be active enough for a collie and not sure it would be a great fit as a breed.",1728596524.0

dogs,New dachshund causing some issues with two resident dachshund: advice! ,"Background: 

I have one senior male min pin mix. He’s kind of just whatever and goes with the flow, not an issue. 

Then I have two miniature dachshunds who are not siblings, but bonded. Male is 2 and female is 1. They are BEST friends and love each other so much. 

I also have 5 cats. 

All animals are spayed/neutered. 

Current: 

I rescued a neglected 1 yr old intact female. She’s about 3 pounds underweight (a 3/9 on the body score scale, should be a 4.5-5) and has some resource guarding issues that we are working on. I believe they mostly stem from either having to fight for her food or just not getting enough. Just in the past 4 days she has shown improvement in trusting that she will get her food and no one will steal it. 

My older dog is adjusting well, he just gets irritated when she bathes him while he’s sleeping. (She just started her heat cycle so she’s VERY much enamored with male dogs right now) 

My female is kind of like whatever and just does her own thing, a very slight lip lifts but nothing major and I corrected immediately. (Just a firm no) She is however jumping my male more which I assume is her way of staking claim to him. (She is spayed)

However, my male is struggling. There’s some jealously there. When playing with my female, and the new pup tries to join in, he started lifting his lip at her. Again, I corrected by firmly saying his name and saying no. He stopped. He’s also been clingier with me. 

My question: 
Just some advice on how to allow everyone the space to adjust but also get along. How long will the stage last? What can I do to create some bonding experiences? 

The new pup has been with us for 5 days, for point of reference. ",1728632179.0

dogs,Senior dog traction for carpet,I have a 12yo small dog who uses a ramp to get on and off the bed. The issue is the ramp is carpet and he’s starting to slide down it and have some issues going up. Has anyone had luck using grip/traction tape that actually sticks to the carpet? We’ve tried other ramps and stairs and he will literally only use this one so not sure what else to try. ,1728612913.0
dogs,Adopting a recently neutered dog,"I'm adopting a dog tomorrow and I am very excited. I do have some concerns though, maybe you can help?  


She's been neutered one week ago and I've read that they need a few weeks to recover. What should I expect?  
She's a very excitable dog and pulls a lot on the lead and is always jumping and playing when I met her. I want to know how to keep her calm so she doesn't upset the wound if she's so excited to come to a new home and explore.   


I have no idea what she'll be like once I get her home. I can deal with anything except I don't want her to hurt herself!

dogs,potty training :(,"i recently got a second frenchie (male 7months) he REFUSES to step a foot in my yard let alone go poop or pee. but he is perfectly fine to go potty on a walk in any other grass. & i don’t mind walking around the block for him to go potty but since it’s getting colder i would like him to go potty in my yard. ive tried to the stand in one spot method & tons of treats & loves after he goes potty on a walk. he’s also watched my other frenchie (female 1yo) go poop & pee in my yard & that doesn’t seem to help either. i take him outside right as he wakes up in the morning (sleeps in kennel) after he pees outside i feed him then take him out again, he has a great routine just will not step foot in my yard. any advice is wonderful & greatly appreciated! thank you!

dogs,I just love my little girl ,"My little girl Laika is a 9 months old rescue mystery mix (Maibe Griffon, Ariegoise and Beagle), yes, she is going through adolescence, it is difficult, but I would not change it for anything in the world.

Lately I have had very bad news regarding my health, including a brain tumor.

I live alone with Laika, she goes to work with me, neither of us can be without the other. She has been my support these weeks, no matter how bad or sad I may feel, she shows me her belly or forces me to clean up her messes. 

I know it's not right, but I've also noticed that lately she's been very protective when I'm not feeling well, almost even biting other people who come near me if I fall sleep somewhere (consecuence of the tumor). I know it's not right, and I gently correct her, but it makes me feel so good that she cares so much, and when she lays on top of me or asks me to hold her, I know I'm not alone.

I have friends and an amazing support net, but at the end of the day, Laiks is who lives with me, and we are both alone at that lonely times and every night, she gives me that daily reassurance that everyone needs in the dark moments.",1728627915.0
dogs,how to correct resource guarding and aggression in a siberian husky?,"Hi everyone, new to the community! I just need some insight into this beautiful doggy. 



This is my Roommate’s 6 year old Siberian Husky, Soto.



I recently moved in 4 weeks ago and it’s been a struggle.  At first I thought maybe the sudden change was what was making it hard for me but then I had 2 incidents where he growled at me (and even tried to bite me) when I tried to lay next to him on MY bed (I didn’t push him or sat fast).



I put a doggy gate infront of my dog and I can tell it bothers him. His owner lets him and his Yorkshire free roam the house, the rooms and the backyard when he’s at work. 



It’s been a struggle, he’s smart, only listens to some commands when it’s obvious that I’ll reward him with high value treats but he’s probably manipulating me.



When it’s just us - he walks slow, tail ALWAYS tucked, ears always pinned, mouth closed. Sometimes he’s licking his lips or aggressively licking his [paws.At](http://paws.At) first I thought maybe he was scared of me, but now I think he’s just standoffish/resentful. 



I feel like he sees me as a threat to everything he’s entitled. I think he’s spoiled, my roommate is a good person but I can tell he didn’t have the heart to train or correct Sotos behavior.",1728645087.0

dogs,has anyone here travelled with their dog with separation anxiety?,"Hello! I’m looking for stories and tips in terms of crate training a dog. 

Our dog will be travelling 2 weeks from now and they started their crate training a month ago. We could see a small progress in terms of his patience but recently, he refused to go inside his crate even though there’s food or his fave toy. We seek a professional trainer for him as we only have limited time, we were shocked to know that our dog has separation anxiety. because he’s always fine whenever we leave him alone in the house. 

They’ve been training him for 3 days now at the training center, and they are not seeing any progress. I really hope that he could overcome the anxiety for his ease of flying in the cargo. (but i know he’ll be hella stressed)

If you guys flew with your dog with anxiety, how did it go? I’m really worried because whenever he’s in the crate, he tries to go out or bark. ",1728628362.0

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* Relaxed, friendly, obedient, relatively easy to train.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* Small to middle-sized dogs. My parents are getting older and would prefer a dog isn't super energetic.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Just basic obedience (sit, stay, etc.)

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* Small to medium.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

dogs,Our English bulldog passed away in her sleep,"Our English bulldog Nibby passed away in her sleep sometime early this past Saturday morning, she was almost 11.  She was our first family dog, that our boys had grown up with all or most of their lives. Around 6am my wife found her in the recliner where she almost always slept at night, but she was already gone, but looked peaceful like she just didn't wake up. Nibby had been slowing down and sleeping a lot the last few months but she had been eating and drinking and going to the bathroom normally.  Friday she had been outside with us laying on the porch in the sun like she always liked to do, and she ate her food at dinner, nothing really different than any other day.  It hurts now that I can't remember how she was when we went to bed that night.  We always envisioned that one day down the road we would have to take her to be euthanized, so this came as a total shock to our family.  We had just talked about making more memories with her on her next birthday in a couple of weeks.  We talked about what to do and decided to take her to be cremated later that day at the only place locally that was open (a place just for pets and they were extremely helpful and compassionate).  We brought her home yesterday with a lot of tears.  We also have a German shepherd Callie she just turned 1 on Sunday, I feel like we didn't give her any time with our bulldog after Nibby had passed so she could realize what had happened, and now she is constantly looking for her.  It keeps going through my head that the last time Callie saw Nibby was us carrying her out the door wrapped in her favorite blankets to take to be cremated.  I also am feeling regret that we got her cremated so soon (it was a Saturday and all our vets were closed) and without really finding out how or why she passed, whether it was a heart attack or cancer or something else, but we didn't know what else to do.  Her next regular vet checkup was supposed to be next week.  We are glad to have her back home but just feeling like we should have done things slower or a little differently, it all seemed so sudden and we were not prepared at all.

dogs,Dog Destroys Kids’ Things,"I rescued a dog as a puppy a year ago and she seems to have a bit of separation anxiety. I tried to avoid it by leaving her as a puppy to go places but I didn’t seem to completely avoid it unfortunately. 

I know all the rules: Don’t make a big deal when leaving and returning, frozen peanut butter Kong, I give her exercise before and after coming home most days. 

She’s a little over a year old now and I tried to leave her out of her kennel because I feel bad leaving her there, but it failed miserably. That said, she only seemed to target my kid’s things well and her own toys. This has always been the case that she has never destroyed anything except my kid’s stuff. And even then it was never much, except this time when left alone. 

I know this is a form of separation anxiety, despite my best intentions, but I’m wondering if there’s a reason she’s targeted my kid that could maybe help at least curb that behavior?


Important things: 

-My kid is 6 and I think she considers them a peers.

-I don’t really have an area in my house that she can be that is “dog proof.” I wish I did.

-She’s a mixed breed, but seems like a herding dog of some type and has a TON of enrichment things, including a herding ball. 

-We have a nice-sized fenced in backyard, but I can’t leave a doggy door open because she likes to try to eat random things back there.

-In the past, she has destroyed things in her kennel with her also, so I only leave her with a Kong and no padding. 

EDITED TO ADD: I should have made it clear that I obviously know she’s going back in the crate. That’s not my question. My specific question is about if anyone has seen where a dog only targets one person’s items.",1728583627.0
dogs,How should I introduce my 3 yo F dog to a 1yo F foster ,"Hello! My husband and I have a 3 yo female husky/Malinois mix at home. We recently found a 1yo female dog in the shelter who is not doing well in the shelter (very terrified of people, but curious about other dogs) who ironically looks identical to our dog at home. We don’t have the heart to leave her in the shelter sad and alone so we decided to foster her. We are supposed to meet her/pick her up today. My question is—how and when should we introduce them? They are both fixed and our dog at home gets along with most dogs (unless a dog instigates a fight, then she will fight back). Should we keep them separate for a couple days to allow the foster to adjust? Once we do introductions I know our dog will run up to the foster and immediately try to play but I am afraid the foster might be so scared she’ll snap. I know that once female dogs fight once, they tend to hold grudges and always fight to the death and I do not want that to happen. I just ultimately want the foster to feel comfortable and hopefully learn to love our dog so we can potentially adopt her.

Now I got another good deal for One, I would be more concerned about changing to another brand but even inside the same brand I assume the recipes change a lot, does anybody have knowledge (by vets, experience, etc) about if doing the small change methond of mixing the different foods slowly is just fine?

dogs,Tough toys for a small dog?,"Hi all! 

My dog is 27 lbs of pure energy and able to destroy a large Kong Extreme within 10 min.

This beast plays with any toy for 5 min or so, and then Goblin mode hits and he goes *surgical* on it. He basically takes on an edge (or seam, if a fabric toy) and metodically chews on that spot as if in a trance. After he finds an opening, his only focus is absolutely ripping it apart.

I let him play with a Tuffy ring and destroy felted dog bones when I'm around to supervise, but all I can leave at home when I'm out is a Benebone, any other toy is a potential hazard.

  
Any ideas? I'm all ears.

dogs,[BREEDS] Would greatly appreciate any recommendations for our family's next dog,"\*\*Introduction\*\*



1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?



\* We had a dog for 13 years. She passed away a year ago. I trained her with help from a professional trainer and really enjoyed the experience. I'd love to train our next dog on my own.



2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?



\* Preference is for rescuing, although we are open to a reputable breeder.



3)	Describe your ideal dog.



\* As a family with kids (ages 8 and 11), we all have different preferences but it seems the consensus would be: a loving family dog, medium sized (roughly), ""fluffy,"" intelligent/trainable, active but not extremely demanding (walks and playtime but not daily dog park trips). And low or no shedding would be great. We have a fenced in yard.



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



\* See above. The kids want an American Eskimo but I'm not sure that's a good fit. We had a border collie mix who was wonderful - only downside was the shedding. I think poodle mixes might make sense although I'm not sure the kids would be as excited about that - a close friend has a poodle mix and our kids don't seem that into it for some reason.



5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?



\* sit, stay, come, heel. Some fun tricks would be great but mostly we want the dog to be trained for safety reasons.



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?



\* Not necessary



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?



\* In terms of physical activity - daily walks or playtime, about 1 hour a day. And plenty of attention/affection at home.



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  



\* Daily walks or playtime in the yard, about 1 hour a day. Dog parks on occasion but not regularly.



9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?



\* We would probably wind up paying someone. We'd prefer not to have a dog that requires a lot of grooming at home (I know that might be at odds with the desire for a ""fluffy"" dog).



\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*



10)	What size dog are you looking for?



\* Medium



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



\* The less, the better. That said, our last dog was a big shedder and we loved her. But our preference is certainly for all these factors to be minimized.



12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



\* Not that important, although I do plan to train the dog.



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



\* Snuggly but not overly needy



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?



\* Either, as long as it's affectionate when the kids want affection



15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  



\* We're flexible. Our last dog was a great watch dog but we don't feel that's necessary. We do have kids over to play (ages 8 and up usually) so we'd hope the dog is chill about that.



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?



\* We don't plan to walk the dog off leash but we do live in an area with tons of dogs so this could be a problem.



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



\* Separation anxiety - we need the dog to be comfortable at home alone for a few hours.



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



\* One of us works at home so it's not a huge issue but we do need a dog that can be alone for a few hours.



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 



\* See above. We plan to have the kids take part in the care of the dog.



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



\* Currently no.



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



\* Yes, ages 8 and up.



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?



\* No plants to rent.



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?



\* USA (California)



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?



\* Southern California. Lows in the 50s/60s, highs up to 100. But we have AC and shade. 



\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*



25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.



\* No additional information.

dogs,"My dog eats everything (yes, the gross stuff) and nothing has worked. ","I adopted my hound mix (he has a tiny bit of german shepherd in him as well) about 2.5 years ago. He was already 1.5 years old when I got him. Aside from his natural hound nature to eat everything, I think he must have been neglected or been a stray for a very long time previously, because he eats it all. 

I've tried bunches of alternatives to get him to stop eating his own poop as well as other dog's too - he'll never stop. At this point, I know it's behavioral because his lab results always come back fine. 

I just need reassurance that muzzling him on walks is the right thing to do. I'm actively training him and he's gotten really used to it. It's sad though, because he doesn't sniff things like he wants to with it on.

Ugh, so tired of my boy grabbing all sorts of things. I'm human and can't catch it all. The stigma and people's judgment/ignorance will suck when he has it on in public, but at this point, I don't really have another choice. ",1728491636.0

dogs,Help with dog who poops inside on an almost nightly basis,"We have two good boys at home, one GSD mix and a Great Dane / Lab mix. The lab mix is the problem child as of lately. We let our dogs out in a large fenced in area of the backyard and I get them to the off-leash dog park a few times a week. Lately I’ve been taking them on longer evening walks in an attempt to mitigate the serial pooper. 

The Great Dane Lab mix routinely poops in the house at night with no signal that he wants to go out. On our late night walks he refuses to poop and when I let them out in the evenings (they are outside for at least 45-60 min every evening before bed) it appears that he is also not pooping. We’ve tried adjusting his feeding schedule to give him his dinner meal at around 4 pm and that doesn’t seem to make much difference either. 

In the past he has had an issue with eating his poop when he poops inside, that has seemed to stop for the most part. 

I love this dog but he is driving me nuts with this issue. He’s always been prone to accidents in the house but lately it has become a regular occurrence.

do we need to keep the dog in the crate everytime there is no one in the house and everytime he has to sleep? or it's necessary only when it's a untrained puppy and then he can roam freely in the house without doing any damage and he could even sleep in just a dogs bed without being locked or even sleeping with us sometimes?

does the crane need to be settled in specific place and then never be moved from there? 

when the dog becames trained I can walk him in public places without problems right? just bring him around, in the car, on vacation, on the beach etc (except where it's not permitted).

dogs,Food Recommendations for Dogs With No Teeth,"Hi everyone!

I have a senior miniature Dachshund who has no teeth. I was wondering if anyone has any good food suggestions? 

The vet said just to feed her normal kibble, and that her cat without teeth eats dry food just fine. However, I’ve noticed she isn’t a fan of plain kibble. From observing her it seems like she’ll eat it if she HAS to almost. 

I started to mix some of her normal kibble with some wet dog food called Cesar and she LOVES it. Does anyone know if Cesar is a good brand? I’ve noticed wet dog food is pretty pricey so I chose Cesar a bit for the price point, but I definitely don’t want to give it to her if it’s not a good brand. 

Another question would be if feeding her chicken and rice would be okay. That’s another thing she eats joyously and the vet says that’s a food that’s soft on the stomach. 

If anyone has any suggestions that would be great! :) ",1728447424.0

dogs,Tips for dealing with guilt surrounding not playing with dog 24/7?,"Hi all - new dog owner here. Had a family dog when I was very young, but I recently adopted a 1 year old rescue who is completely mine! He's crazy and I love him (Jack Russell/Frenchie/unknown hybrid), he's so full of beans. I'm doing a Master's at the moment, so I'm in the house A LOT, but understandably not all of that time is play time, it's work time. 

  
I take him out for 2 substantial walks a day, totalling around 10,000 - 12,000 steps. On at least one of these walks, I'll run around with him on a green as he really loves being chased/chasing. I'll also play with him sporadically throughout the day at home, as well as cuddles and pets. He sometimes sits on my lap while I'm working, too. However - he wants to play/ have my attention all the time, and I have a hard time putting my foot down as to when enough is enough. I feel so terribly guilty saying no to him or not giving him attention when he comes looking for it. He does have toys and he loves to chew, so I'm not just leaving him with nothing to entertain himself either. 

  
I guess my main questions are, how do you know when you're giving your dog enough exercise/attention, and number two, how do you deal with the guilt of the puppy dog eyes waiting for you to give them attention? I think he just thinks because I'm at home, I'm available to play all day. Obviously he doesn't understand what I'm doing on the computer or when I'm reading/writing. I'm struggling to actually relax or enjoy any personal time because I feel like I'm being a bad dog mom if I'm not up running after him every second I have!

dogs,Breed Recommendations-If you have time," **Hello! As the title suggests I’m looking for breed recommendations. I did my best to fill out the template, and I will answer any additional questions or concerns in the comments**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be my first dog on my own, family has had dogs since I was very young. I was the go to pet-sitter in the neighborhood and have experienced big breeds and small breeds alike.

I helped potty train and teach basic commands for four different dogs in the past ten years.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I currently live in an apartment, and am mostly considering an ethical breeder so I can have a better estimate of the dog’s characteristics. (However I am in driving distance of a few major cities, so if anyone has a recommendation on a non-puppymill pet store please let me know! The only name I know of is Petland and I’m not 100% sure if they are ethical or not!)

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I am looking for a companion! Small-large breed, leaning more towards med-large. (Golden retriever size max since I’m in an apartment).
*I am planning on getting a boy, and don’t mind shedding or moderate activity levels. I want my future son to help me better myself through exercise (and I am planning on beginning before I get the boy to start good habits) and I am already happily planning on taking my son to nearby dog parks, puppy play dates, the lake, and even a doggy daycare once a week.
*I can confidently say I will be a crazy dog mom and provide the best life to my son.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I absolutely adore the golden retriever, and am heavily considering a show line puppy just to avoid that field line hyper activity level.
I also like the Keeshond, Samoyed, and Bernese mountain dog (though they are probably too big for me) and wouldn’t mind a mutt but I’m worried a mix will be harder to find.
*I do not like greyhounds, poodles, pit bulls (not because they’re “aggressive” I just think they’re too boxy for me lol) or intense herding breeds.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just the basic command with a few more intermediate commands, a recall command specifically. I’m planning on enrolling in a training class.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* no ♥️ 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 3-4 hours weekdays
Longer playdates/activities on weekends 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I’m planning on a nice long walk in the morning and evening on top of quicker potty break walks, and more intense activities on the weekends / evenings when I don’t work in the morning after. Walks around the lake and even swimming in the lake, doggy daycare maybe once a week, dog park trips, and play dates with family/friends dogs too.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I wouldn’t mind a thicker coat, somewhere between two to three times a week brushing would be fine.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* small-large, leaning more medium-large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Not a drool fan, shedding at any level is fine, and barking more moderate/controllable. I would like an alert bark but not overly talkative like a husky.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I want my dog to learn that recall command, so decently important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly dog 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* eager to please/ attention-hog dog

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I would love that alert bark to let me know something is going on, and wouldn’t mind an overly friendly dog like the golden. But I have realized that I still want to be the most important person to my dog.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* If I can teach basic control commands yes! But I’m not sure I could handle a German Shepard or similar.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Just that overwhelming aggression or barking habit.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* weekly during my 9-5, however I already go home during lunch so he’ll get a potty break in the middle. So realistically 4-5 hours max alone. Also have a family member in the same apartment complex who can perform check ins as need during puppy stages.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* my dog/son only

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* no other pets 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* middle school age siblings, but no young children in the near future.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I currently rent an apartment no known restrictions on breeds

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*I live in Oklahoma and I don’t know of any breed restrictions, however I’m not very interested in very large breeds or aggressive breeds that would be restricted.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* super hot (but windy) summers and decently cold winters. (Yes I am ready for walks during both)

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I will note that I am 23F and living alone, which is why I would love that bark to alert trait. And I do like the medium-large breeds just to look a little more threatening on late night walks, and for them to able to hold their potty a little bit longer. I am weirdly picky as well since I was one of those kids who read books about dogs when I was young, just looking for breeds I may have overlooked or pups highly suggested. Like I mentioned if anyone has specific places to get a pup from please recommend those as well. Thank you !

dogs,7 month old puppy getting bullied at dog parks,"Hello everyone, I’m looking for some insight or advice. I have a 7 month old bernedoodle puppy. She’s about 50 pounds, very sweet, playful, high energy and submissive. When we go to the dog park, she loves to run, chase, and wrestle, but about half the time we are there adult dogs are constantly bullying and attacking her. She’s not trying to play with them. They are finding her. I would understand if she’s being annoying puppy and they’re telling her to stop, but they are actively chasing her, biting her hunches and her neck, growling and pinning her down. She gets scared and submissive but they continue to attack her and chase her. The owners of the dogs always swear that never happened before and they’re surprised their dog is behaving that way. I would love some insight into why this could be happening. She is not spayed yet, but has not shown any signs of going into heat. I can’t think of any other reason why she gets singled out and attacked so much. I know dog parks aren’t recommended for puppies but at seven months I felt like she’s old enough to go. She has so much energy and the dog park is such a good way to run her, so would love to be aware of things that I can do or look for while we’re there to prevent anything bad from happening. So any dogs psychologists out there that could enlighten me in anyway I would appreciate it. 🐶🥺🐾

dogs,Which dog for my family?,"Hey all, been a dog lover all my life. Grew up with an Afghan Hound, had a Basset, and two Dachshunds. My old girl passed in June, and we have our senior weiner still with us. 

We've just bought a new home with 3.5 acres of wooded property along a shallow (mostly shin-knee deep) river. It's a beautiful place, and we're really excited to start this chapter.  My wife and I have two little girls, ages four and two.

We're looking for a dog to bring into the family in the spring, and would like some thoughts from knowledgeable folks on what breeds may fit our situation. We're a moderately active family, and our children are very loving and respectful of the dogs. With the new property, we have a couple campsites and a cabin on the property, trails throughout, and plenty of forest and river bank. 

I'm looking for a dog that can be in the bush with me, but also flop on the couch with the kids. It would spend an average of about 2.5 hours a day alone, during the week, as my wife and I work opposite shifts, and the kids would be at school/daycare. Having owned hounds my whole life, i'm used to the stubbornness that comes with them, but also am very open to a dog with excellent recall. A breed that can be relaxed and lay with you at your side at a bonfire without taking off would be lovely, as well.

Would prefer short to medium coat, and as little shedding as possible. 

I'm probably going to get a lot of lab/golden retreiver suggestions, here, and believe me, we've discussed them both at length. Looking for other suggestions we may not be considering at the moment. 

For reference, I'm partial to a bluetick and redbone coonhounds, as well as american foxhounds. 

Thanks so much for any and all advice

We thought the poop would eventually dissolve. No. Big no. So 5 months later, we have an area of the yard that is completely covered in the gross white furry poo. We're going to clean that up over the weekend, but does anyone have suggestions for the future?

dogs,Lost my dog to GDV,"My poor girl 17 Shih Tzu Bichon mix, just work up one moring in pain. And with the closest Emergency vet 30 mins away. We ran out of time. Vet said she had little to no chance of surviving the needed surgery and was put down.

After researching and learning what GDV even is now, I can't help but look back and blame myself for not catching any of the early warning signs.

It also happened close to the start of new prescription food for a bladder stone. I also wonder if that triggered anything, and if I killed her by giving her it.

I just can't stop crying and blaming myself. And regret not maximizing my time and attention to her. Like watching TV or playing games or just working too much. All that time could have been spent for more walks and adventures with her.

Going through and storing, donating, or throwing away her old things feels so painful. Like I'm deleting my best friend's existence. She was my daily reason to go outside to a park, or hang out and maintain the backyard for her. With living on my own, I have zero reasons or motivation now go outside. And doing anything to make myself happy feels wrong and selfish with out her. I haven't been able to eat much, since we would have meals at the same time and I would always share a little with her. 

I feel like I took her for granted, and didn't realize how dependent I was on her. She was the center of my world. My shadow when doing anything. And now I feel empty, pointless, like a bad owner. I just can't stop crying and figuring out how to live life without her.",1728390086.0

dogs,Adoption blues. I’m losing it. ,"I very impulsively adopted a senior dachshund with no teeth, and arthritis yesterday. I have a 5 year old black and tan currently and I thought it would be nice to get him a friend. My husband wasn’t “sold” but wasn’t against it either, but I should have learned. I think with my emotions and not my brain and I just felt really bad for him. Really he hasn’t done anything wrong (besides a little pee here and there) but I’m just so completely out of my routine and I cannot stop sobbing. I’m resenting him from taking time away from  me and my first dog. He’s been the only dog for 5 years and I wish I could undo everything I just did. I can’t even return him because it was a high volume kill shelter and I’m worried that he will end up in a bad place. They still made me sign a contract saying I’d bring him back if anything happened but I’d never bring him back there. Will I stop feeling this way eventually? I seriously am like beside myself and feeling VERY dumb. My best friend is a dog trainer and told me this was stupid and now
I’m stuck. So not only do I feel bad because everyone is mad at me, but now I can’t even fix this situation by letting him go elsewhere because I don’t want to traumatize him anymore than he already is. 

I’m just looking for support. I know it takes 3 days, 3 weeks and 3 months.. but I don’t want to wait too long and make it worse on anyone. I just want my life back, but also feel bad for the new dog. I’m so distraught I can’t eat. ",1728359965.0

dogs,How to introduce a dog to 4 resident cats,"I am in the process of adopting a dog from a local shelter but I already own four cats. I need to know how to introduce them properly. I've looked at videos and articles but I've never really found answers to introducing a dog to multiple cats. 



The dog is about a year and a half old and is used to cats, so I'm not really expecting him to be an issue.
My cats have had no experience with dogs, and I'm expecting them to be the biggest issue. 


Some additional questions:

Should I introduce them one at a time?
Do they always need to be together when they see the dog so that they all have the same degree of socialization?
Will the social order of my cats effect the introduction? Should I introduce the boss cat first?


I will be so grateful for any help you can provide thank you!!!",1728345754.0

dogs,Recommendations for single person living in apt for protection,"
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

No, I grew up with dogs,  everything from Shih Tzu to mastiffs.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder? 

I’m down with either or but if I’m looking for a specific breed, I might go with a breeder just to make sure I get what I’m looking for.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Does good with apartment living with medium to low energy (I’ll be able to take it for walks or bike rides if it does need exercise). I need something to look intimidating as I’ll be leaving alone, want something protective but I won’t need it to do any bite work. A large breed, I don’t care for dogs with big drooling faces, but open to suggestions.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Great Dane/Irish wound – I know they’re technically a giant breed, but I love their temperament. I’ve own a Great Dane before, and he was the sweetest couch potato but anytime I took him out. People would deliberately move around me because of his size.

Cane Corso- large breed and seems to have more of a mastiff mentality. Also, I’ve heard that they’re very attached to their owners and protective. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

 all of your basics and recall. I’d also like to train it to be able to bark on command.

No

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

2+ hours a day walking or biking with me.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I can do grooming myself (I’m a vet tech), I can groom once a week if need be, but less is better

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?
Large

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

 Less is better, but I don’t prefer slobbery face dogs

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
Not very, but I will train him on recall is he does get loose

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Couch potato

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Own thing

Hyper active and reactive dogs (huskies, boxers, German shepherds, etc.)

dogs,Help!  Dog ran through our electric fence.,"Hello everyone.  Okay, we have an electric fence around our yard.  Dog was great for months.  Then the collar stopped working for a bit and then he started leaving.

He only leaves our house on the driveway, seems to take the hit and move on.  Anywhere else in yard he won’t go through, even to come back home.  He has to walk on driveway.

dogs,Travelling with a dachshund or finding suitable alternatives?,"Hi there,

My husband and I are considering getting a dog, specifically a dachshund. We've given it a lot of thought and are excited about the prospect. We live in a very dog-friendly city in Europe, next to two parks. I work from home, we love spending time outdoors and we fully understand the significant lifestyle change a dog would bring. We're willing to accept all that.

However, there is one concern that we haven't been able to resolve. We like to travel once a year for a month to escape the cold winter while working remotely. The destination (Madeira) is a 5 hour flight for us. We're not sure how we could manage this with a dog. Taking a dog on a plane seems stressful and dangerous for the animal and the idea of leaving our dog at a pet boarding facility for a whole month seems sad. Unfortunately, leaving the dog with family or friends for such a long time isn't an option either.

dogs,Dog Keeps Digging Holes In the Yard! How to make her stop!?,"I have 2 dogs. This post concerns the husky aussie sheperd mix.

She has taken to digging holes randomly in the yard. Before anyone says it's cause she's bored, I don't think that's the cause. Our exercise routine looks like this, every morning from 6am with them both in the yard, running off their crazy, playing, and going potty that takes about 15 minutes. We get ready and take a 45 minute-1 hour sniff walk, mostly off leash, followed by 20-30 minutes of fetch. They get breakfast and free access to the yard until lunchtime. We play games for about 30 minutes.  Late afternoon/ early evening another 45 minute - 1 hour  sniff walk, before dinner. Then it's pretty chill for the rest of the day until bedtime. We do this every day. I feed them both meals from slow feeder/puzzle bowls.

Now, she doesn't do it all the time and normally when in the yard she lays in the shade or likes to chill on the deck and people watch. She's nosy.

Just randomly she'll come slinking in looking guilty as hell, and I look out and there's a massive hole. We walk 4-5 miles every single day. I don't know what to do, but the holes are driving me nuts. Any ideas?

dogs,Adopted husky has turned our home into a war zone ,"We recently adopted a 7 year old female husky and our home has turned into a war zone. We have 3 other dogs, two females (7) and one boy (5), all of them smaller than our husky. We rescued our boy from the pound a few years ago and he is STILL working on coming out of his shell, even though he’s com a longggg way. Our husky is full of energy and does not act like she’s 7, so all she wants to do is play. Our female dogs have been slowly warming up to her but our boy really hasn’t. Our husky has picked up on our boy not being happy and has taken that as a challenge. Our boy is never the one to attack first, I’m not sure what he’s giving off, but it’s making her lunge first. Thankfully we can see the body language change and intervene before it gets too bad, however, at first we thought she just wanted to play with him, now we’re thinking it’s something else. Even after we get in the middle of them, our boy is shaking scared and our husky is still trying to get to him. After we take their mind off of it, like take them outside for example, everybody is fine and happy and running around together. So, 🤯 

We also noticed yesterday that she was just wandering around the house aimlessly and one of female dogs was eating. The husky kept circling our female dog that was eating and then once we called her away, she came into the living room and got into another fight with our boy. Was she hunting? Is she bored? We’re at a loss. 

She truly is a sweet girl however she has been alone almost all of her life, with occasional interactions with other dogs. Her first owner was a friend of the family and he had her for 2 years. He was elderly and passed so my grandfather helped find her another home with an elderly man as a solo dog and he has had her for the last 5, until she became too much for him in his age. We have absolutely no history on if/how she was trained, we just know she had very limited interactions with other dogs. She was with my grandfather for a bit but he has 3 other big husky dogs and she just seemed to fall in line. Is it because she’s the biggest? Is this normal husky behavior? I know huskies can be unpredictable and protective, and if that was never broken in her are we playing with fire? ",1728314650.0

dogs,"[RIP] Kal, large mixed, 7","I lost my dog yesterday 

I had my foxhound/anatolian shepherd mix since he was a puppy almost 8yrs ago. He was the first dog I raised by myself. He was a handful for the first 2yrs at minimum and my husband and I fought a lot about whether I should give him away. Kal got better and my husband eventually accepted him. Kal was like that dog from Marley and Me. He would condor in and jump on the fence, bark nonstop at people and would not listen. I took him to so many obedience classes. The connection I had with Kal wasn’t instant but it grew steadily and for the past 4-5yrs, he was my “baby”. 

I miss so much about him. Whenever I would see him sleeping on his bed and I’d approach him, he’d thump his tail loudly on the floor, excitedly awaiting me to approach, then he’d flop over on his back so i could give him belly rubs. Whenever I would crouch down by him while he was standing, he’d always turn and rest his head on my shoulder, or he’d come up and nuzzle into my legs so I could scratch his ears. 

He lost 9lbs in 6 weeks and I had just taken him 6 weeks ago to get moles removed (that thankfully were non cancerous) and got x rays and bloodwork. The vet wasn’t too concerned about his findings.

Fast forward to 6 days ago, Kal was a lot more lethargic and picky with his food. His belly was getting bloated yet his hipbones and spine were protruding more. Then yesterday he wouldn’t eat at all. Not even the tasty human food. I took him to another vet that’s 24/7, and X-rays and bloodwork now show a giant mass in his abdomen and him losing a lot of blood, as well as liver and pancreatic issues. My options were try a surgery that probably would end with him being euthanized while under, or euthanized right there. I wanted to bring him home and follow up with his regular vet, but i honestly don’t think he could’ve made it through the night at home. So I was either I’m and he passed in my arms. I miss him terribly and feel like I failed him. I feel like the vets lied to me. Kal had the exact same thing my previous dog did and a part of me questioned if they just told me that to push an expensive surgery and it wasn’t that serious. I know that’s crazy, the vet thought euthanasia was the best option, not surgery. And it was far less expensive than a surgery so why would they even do that. I am just shocked. I feel this hole in my chest and I miss my boy.

Thanks if you read all that. I just needed to put it out there. I miss him and wish I had him with me still. ",1728299009.0
dogs,"Dog died, was he unique ?","My Broholmer died recently at the age of 13, he lost the battle with cancer and for him it was a peaceful and painless end. For me, it is like a hole in my life was created and i am fighting daily with the loss.

I hope it will get better over time but in those 11 years i had him since i took gim from the shelter i noticed so many different traits on him which i never saw in other dogs. (from friends and family)

I would like to hear from users here if they had similar traits on their dogs and if my perception of him being different is just my personal opinion.

Yes I know, my dog is the best, beautiful and most amazing one.



But let me list a few things and i am looking forward to your responses:

- never played with any toys / ignored balls, sticks, etc.

- understood complex commands and understood situations (joined me at work at different clients)

- never barked or made any sounds (only when playing with other dogs)

- never took, damaged, chewed on anything

- was ultimately calm (even as a youngster), wasnt stressed by anything

- was very happy to meet dogs and humans, greeted everyone but immediately went on to do his stuff (sniffing)

- never needed a leash, not even in busy streets, etc.

  
The only thing which definetly made him a dog: He loved to eat and hunt squirrels

dogs,Dog is barking when alone and bothers our neighbors ,"Hi! I’m getting real desperate and fear being kicked out and losing all my deposit, any help is greatly appreciated!! (sorry for formatting)

My [21M] dog is a 10 year old male bichon frise, we’ve been together since he was a pup. Last month we have technically ran away from our family and been living in a flat with 2 acquaintances. I work 9 hours in retail, takes around 12 with all the travel, between 4-6 days a week. The past days have been just walking with him, work, walking with him and having dinner together, i take him with myself on dates and all that when i have the day off. 

The issue is that he barks when alone. Obviously it’s my and my parents fault for not teaching him to stay silent and calm when he was small. I am insanely busy and broke now. I am clueless as to what to do because it bothers my neighbors, they have a baby, of course right by our shared wall and they like to threaten me with having me kicked out for this. Although i don’t think this is that much out of the ordinary for an apartment complex, i am well aware he shouldn’t be doing this and he’s annoying. 

My room is finally safe for him so i have left him free in the room, before that he was in his travel box, which he was used to but it obviously is awful for him. Turns out this makes him bark more. 

I want to teach him but that’s a really slow process. What could i do in the meantime that would still allow us to eat for the month? I’ve been looking at ways to sound proof the room or maybe get him a bigger kennel that could be more easily ‘soundproofed’ but i heard it doesn’t work well for noises as loud as barking. I also have wanted him neutered but was unable to do so before. We’re also trying to figure out if there are other parts of the apartment where he’s not bothering so much. 

I would *really* appreciate any advice and help, i can not lose him. ",1728291555.0
dogs,Surrendering,"I’m absolutely heartbroken, I’ve never had to surrender an animal. I genuinely don’t know how to live with it, I feel so much guilt and sadness. I lost both two fur babies within a couple years of one another. I found my dog hours after having a massive stroke. It’s was genuinely incredibly traumatic. 

Eventually after moving to Texas , I decided it was the right time to rescue again. I fell in love with this sweet boxer mix, we named her Ivy. Ivy has always had quite the personality. Right off the bat she displayed issues with resource guarding. We didn’t think it wasn’t something we could help her work through. We brought in trainer into the home, it really seemed to be improving. 

Fast forward, we decided to get her a companion after the 18 months of having her. We brought home a puppy to raise aside her and initially things were great. They made good friends. 

All of a sudden they kept getting into fights, I can’t tell you how many bites and bruise’s I’ve obtained trying to break them up. Ivy’s aggression started making its appearance full force and it wasn’t just at other dogs, but both my boyfriend and I as well. She got very comfortable growling, baring her teeth, snapping and snarling at us. She nips but has never seriously injured anyone. 

One minute she’s the sweetest dog melting in your lap, the next she’s terrifying. It’s unbelievable that this is the same dog. I’ve been so desperate to help her and make this work. She has had so many chances. It’s been going on for more than a year. We have tried everything From an in-home trainer, to vet visits,separation, structure, mussel training, extra exercise, 101 attention, separate beds and anxiety medication. 

It’s constant and unpredictable. It’s over food, toys, attention, territory, grooming and even eye contact. I can’t even pet her at this point without getting grasped at or nipped. 

My boyfriend has been at the end of his rope for awhile, begging me to call it. He’s been very patience with my stubborn desperation to help her. I’m the last person to surrender an animal, feels unforgivable. I’m certain they won’t rehome her again. The fact that this feels like a matter of life and death makes it so much harder. However I recognize her quality of life isn’t what it should be and that’s devastating. I just want her to be at ease, I love her inexplicably. 

I was petting her in bed today and all of a sudden not only nipped at me but then aggressively jumped on top of my. It really scared me. I feel like I’ve completely lost the dog I brought home, she’s just mean all the time now and none of my effort or money is fixing anything. I’m worn out and I’m scared, I feel like I’m being held hostage because the idea of her being put down absolutely kills me. 

I know I might get some backlash for not doing this sooner but I just really wanted to help her. I don’t think I can do this anymore and it’s absolutely going to devastate me. I don’t know how I’ll be able to forgive myself. ",1728290752.0
dogs,Advice on this stray!!!,"He’s extremely friendly and sweet. No food aggression, no growling, loves pets and scratches, stayed still for his bath even though he was scared, watched tv with me while I called my sister. He hasn’t left my side since bringing him home. His nails look clipped. This leads me all to believe he may have been someone’s pet, but I’m going off of cat rules, I don’t really know dog behaviour.
I checked him over for injuries. He has some missing patches of hair, but nothing he reacted to. Walks fine. Looks like he might have something up in his eyes but I’m not sure— I cleaned it up and he’s looked fine since. 
What worries me is that he flinches when i touch him. He is skeletal looking. I wish I could say I’m exaggerating. I had to feed him in increments because he was making himself sick from how fast he was eating the food I gave him. He was so cold when I found him. If he belongs to somebody, I’m worried he’s being harmed or neglected. I have owned dogs almost all of my childhood, but since moving out from my family home, I’ve only had cats. I can get everything he needs and I have a massive group of support who can take care of him while I work, but I’m wondering if he’d be in better hands if I surrender him. 
He’s a pitbull, and I’m so worried about what could happen to him. I’m trying not to get attached, but it’s hard when he’s laying on my chest and staring at me with those massive puppy dog eyes. The bastard. I also don’t want him to go back into the hands of a potential owner that was harming him. 
Anyways, this is all a long-winded way of asking for advice. 
What I need is advice on how to proceed with what to do with him. He just seems hungry and cold. If I hold onto him, what all is he gonna need? Like what toys are best for a dog? I know how to train a dog, thanks to my mom, but I’m lost on what enrichment he’d need. What’s the best food for dogs? Treats? Did I fuck up giving him hamburger buns? 
Sorry for how scattered this all is. I’m just a bit shocked that I have a dog (who just an hour ago I almost hit with my car) in my apt right now lol. ",1728288450.0

dogs,Newly Transplanted Liver Survivor Looking for Training Advice,"Hey all! I'm new to this community and navigating Reddit for the first time. I’m just over two months post-liver transplant, and my husband is going back to work tomorrow after caring for me.

I’m dealing with intense joint pain and difficulty getting around, but I just got my two dogs back! I have a 2-year-old, 60 lb Shepherd-Beagle mix named Frae (she's named after someone, and it's pronounced like ""Fray"") and a smaller mixed breed named Greta, affectionately known as “Little Bit,” who is a 4-year-old, 13lb Jack Russell-Chihuahua mix.

Unfortunately, I can’t withstand more than 20 lbs of pressure on my body right now, so walking them isn’t an option. We live in an apartment that requires leashes for outdoor poop breaks, so my husband and I put some fake grass on our balcony.

I’m hoping to train them to use these pads since I’m not supposed to be around any animal waste. My husband has graciously offered to clean up when he gets home, but I want to prevent any accidents inside.

We've already been working with them, and they have gone to the bathroom on the grass mats, but they still want to go outside and not just on the balcony. I’m looking for training tips to help them understand that the balcony is their new bathroom for now—preferably something that will work relatively quickly! I absolutely will NOT be able to handle rehoming my babies. I missed them way too much during my recovery.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much in advance!",1728285189.0

dogs,Breed Specific Reactive Dog,"Hey all! 

Just want some advice and also some people's opinions on my friends dog that I am pet sitting.

TLDR: How can I train my dog to be less reactive to specific breeds and was I in the wrong for having a reactive dog on leash in a dog park. 

My friends dog is a cattle cross (maybe lab or staffie. He has a big head!) and he's a pretty chill boy. They think he might have been a street dog because he had pretty bad teeth and is very protective of his food. 

He's very chill most of the time except! when he comes across Rottys or Golden Retrievers. He gets that look in his eyes when they come close and he'll start to bark and jump around. He's not aggressive at that stage, no hackles or snarling, but if they get too close for too long he'll get pretty aggro; snarling, aggressive barking and some lunging. 

My first question is if there is anything I can do to help ease the anxiety he feels around these types of dogs? Any other breed he's very happy to sniff and be sniffed and doesn't really react unless someone tries to hump him (fair imo haha).

Second question is one around etiquette. I went to an off leash dog park with my JRT and the cattle-cross. I keep him on lead because he's not mine and I don't trust his recall entirely. 

Today at the dog park a rotty ran over quite suddenly and I immediately walked in the other direction. It startled the cattle-cross and they immediately started snarling and snapping at each other (and my JRT joined in to stand up for the cattle-cross which warms my heart to see them protect each other but didn't help ease the situation 😂)

The owner of the rotty was pretty aggressive and yelled at me that the cattle-cross was too aggressive and that it shouldn't be in the dog park. I replied that my dog was on a leash and that his dog ran over. He said that ""that's on you. I can't stop my dog from running over"". 

I'm pretty sure one of the rules off leash is to be able to control your dog but I also appreciate that my cattle-cross is very reactive. Was I in the wrong?

dogs,I don't even know where to start. ,"Some background : we have 3 dogs; Axl (almost 10yr old Pitty mix) Luna (5ish yr old husky mix) and Finn (almost 7 month husky / aussie shep mix) 

All rescues( Luna and Axl from a local shelter/ Finn was rehomed bc prev owner couldn't handle a puppy in a tiny apartment while also having a toddler at home) 

This post is for Finn specifically.  For the most part, everyone gets along. However, at random times for what seems like no reason Finn will simply lose her sh*t and go after Luna (who is more than double her size) tonight, it was while everyone was in bed going to sleep. Luna doesn't retaliate but does try to defend herself - obviously I break things up and everyone gets separated /goes to their own space to calm down. I've been nipped a couple of times.

We've only had Finn since end of July so she's still in the 3-3-3 stages. She's a good dog, and super smart and trainable. But I don't understand what is going on with her. 

She's still very hesitant around people (including us) and stiffens up when approached, but if she comes on her own she's very lose and wiggly, not crazy affectionate which is totally fine, I can absolutely live with that (Luna is super similar in that she'll ask for affection when she wants it/otherwise leave her be). But with Finn, and these random outbursts /attacks (should note she doesn't do that with Axl just Luna) I'm having serious flashbacks to a previous dog we had that after 3yrs, thousands of dollars, multiple trainers and specialists and vet visits and meds was so violent we had no choice other than B/E. I don't want to even think if going that route again, but maybe Finn might have to be in an only dog home? I may have to find her a new home. I'm trying not to cry as I even type that sentence. 

Any advice, please. ",1728275540.0
dogs,Returning a rescue due to health concerns? ,"ladopted a dachshund through a local rescue today, who is a 9 year old boy who just had all his teeth removed. I have a 5 year old dachshund now, and thought he would be a good addition. He is underweight and malnourished so keep that in mind.

He stands with his back legs together, the seem very weak/ lame..? he bunny hops when running, and kind of has that ""goose walk"" gait...and he falls to one side if you barely touch him / falls falls to one side in general. He seems kind of just out of it? Idk how to explain it but it doesn't seem like he's got any clue on what is going on around him.

dogs,I'm stumped. Dog with long quick.,"I've had my dog for years now, she's 6. She's a cocker spaniel cross cavalier. I've been trimming her nails for years - I really like it and don't get too nervous about it, I use clippers -  but she is terrified of getting her nails trimmed and through a lot of hard training I have gotten her better at sitting still for it etc. but something has always bothered me. Her long nails. Even though I trim them regularly her quicks are just so darn long. I adopted her when she was 9 months and she came from a not so great home to start her life. She must have had a bad experience with her nails and they never trimmed them again/ kept her in one room for most of her puppy stage. 

So the whole time I've had her, her nails and quicks have been long. And I just can't get them shorter. Any suggestions? I have cut her quick a couple of times over the years, which set us back. I'm worried about getting too close. Her nails are a brownish colour. All the tips online are for white nails or completely black nails. Both of which aren't helpful as I can't see the quick, but there's no ""black dot"" to look out for as her nail/ quick is a tan brown colour and pretty uniform. The only way I can tell I'm getting close to the quick is she gets super sensitive to the touch, and yelps and pulls away, quickly ending our nail session. 

I've asked the vet about it and they said, yep her quicks are quite long, and her nails sometimes peel so they recommended a better diet which we have started now. 

I know a dremel would be good. But it is just not an option. I just can't see her being ok with the vibration, the noise, it sounding her nails etc. it took us literal years to get her semi comfortable with some hair clippers. Even then she only lasts a couple of minutes. 

I've started to consider taking her to the vet again to see if they have any advice. Put her on sedatives etc.

I would love any advice or product recommendations if there's a nail file tool or something you have used and had good luck with. 

Oh and the best thing that has ever worked for us is spending a week at the beach and the sand wore down her quick on the inside and I was able to cut the hollowed nail. It was only a few mm and it grew back fairly quickly, but maybe I need another long holiday at the beach 🤔",1728273340.0

dogs,How long did it take for your dog to adjust to a new apartment?,"Hello! I recently moved into a new apartment with my dog (8 year old standard poodle) and he seems to be having some trouble settling in. It's been a little under 2 weeks and while he is fine when I'm home, he cries and barks a lot when I am not there. 

You would think this would be a sign of separation anxiety but in my previous home, he's had no issues being by himself. I usually don't leave him alone for more than 5 hours a day anyways. I don't want this moving experience to develop into separation anxiety for him. 

I know adjusting will take time and my dog is a bit sensitive to new noises. When we first moved in, every noise would set him off. Now, he seems more tolerant to neighbor-related noise. The only noises he doesn't like is when people walk too close to my front door or stomp down the stairs. 

I have been providing lots of physical and mental stimulation- walking 1 hour off leash/long-line in the morning, multiple slow sniffing potty breaks throughout the day, games/puzzles, etc.- but he still seems to be having a hard time. He doesn't sleep/settle when I leave for the day. My dog also isn't very food or toy motivated, so training him has always been hard.

I'd appreciate any advice or criticism from fellow dog owners! How long did your dog take to adjust? Any tips on how to help my dog settle in more comfortably? Thanks in advance!",1728261975.0

Now I’ve taken her to a vet (2 different ones) to which they say all tests have come back fine and she has no issues aside from just being overweight that in fact she’s quite healthy including her great dental. To size, she should be 15lbs but she is 20lbs. It’s a lot for her little body. I’ve done years of diet foods, changing foods, cutting her intake. Increased exercise, cut treats down. Etc. I’ve done everything the vet tells me. It always ends back to them saying let’s try this diet food to which never helps. I’m really doing my best to help her lose weight because as she gets older, I know it’s going to weigh down on her joints. Are there any recommendations someone can give me? Has anyone done something that maybe they think I may have not? I’d like to really get my girl into shape. She’s been a great dog to me and deserves the absolute best. ",1728260812.0
dogs,What is your opinion on doodles?,"After becoming more educated on ethical dog breeding I stopped liking doodles, mainly the doodle breeders. If you look up Utah Doodles and see exactly how bad the breeding is you'll probably start to understand just how bad the doodle craze is. A lot of those dogs are not health tested, have unpredictable temperments, sizes and coats and aren't even cared about it's all about the money for those big breeders. I decided not to ever own a doodle just because I hate how unpredictable they are and how much they are priced even though they are a mutt. I currently own a standard poodle puppy and she is the best dog ever. I got her from a breeder and she has an awesome temperament and I know what her coat and size is going to be like. It's funny to see how people would rather get a doodle over a poodle even though they can look the same if you give them certain haircuts!",1728260406.0
dogs,How do I help my dog mourn the passing of her brother?,"First of all, I'm sorry if I used the wrong flair, I'm new to this sub and just needed some advice on how to help my pup.

Our first family dog passed away yesterday, he was 12 years old and it was just his time to go. We have a second dog, who's 8 years old, and the only other dog in the family. She's always been a bit reclusive and introverted, but for the last couple of days, she's been in her own world entirely, not really eating at all and just sleeping alone in another room. We've been sticking to her usual schedule of walks, food, and rest but she's just very uninterested in everything and she's just been lying in bed all day and night. 

Really, I'm just wanting to know if there's anything I can do to help her grieve and start getting back to her old self. The only thing we're not open to is getting another pet, as both of the dogs had been living at my parents' house and they're both too old to take care of a new pup (they're also super expensive along with two kids in college).

dogs,Anyone able to stop the howling?,"I recently learned via a Ring camera that my 4 year old Maltese will bark/howl when we go out. It doesn't seem to happen much when we go to work, but seems to occur multiple times if we leave for a few hours into the evening (for example, on the weekend). My husband comes home every weekday for lunch, and I don't come home later than 3:30 PM usually (leaving around 8 am). If we are going to be gone for more than a few hours on the weekend, and my mom can't watch her, my neighbor checks in. I see a lot of similar posts, but would love ""success stories"" with what worked. She is super excited when we leave because she knows she's getting treats  in a ruffle mat and a puzzle thing; she doesn't display any signs of anxiety.

dogs,Said Goodbye Today,"Cheyenne was a 60lbs German shepherd-Lab mix. 10 year old, tripod (back right leg missing amputated at 4 months old). Wednesday morning she woke up and couldn't use her back leg. She could only walk on her front legs and was dragging her back around. I made an appointment at the vet for Thursday. She was able to walk intermittently and the vet prescribed methocarbamol (500mg every 12 hrs) and carprofen (50mg every 12 hrs). So Thursday and Friday she has the meds, and she was walking fine. Saturday she didn't appear to be in any pain, was walking fine, chasing the cat, etc so no pain meds. This morning no issues and I thought we should take the dogs for a walk since she seems to be doing ok, they hadn't been for a few days, and we were going to be out skydiving all day and they'd be stuck in the house. We made it 0.1 mile before she started giving up so we turned around. I went around the block with the other dog and my husband went home with Cheyenne. He had to carry her home. I got home like 7 minutes later and gave her her pain pills. We decided to stay home. About 45 minutes later she was breathing heavy, her eyes were twitching, and her pupils were huge. Thought maybe it was a bad reaction and she was over heating so we put some ice packs in her armpits under her neck and on her stomach to bring her temp down and then called the emergency vet to see if they thought we should bring her in. We brought her in and within minutes of us arriving they were doing CPR on her.

I'm afraid making her go on the walk or giving her the medication caused her seizure. I'm worried she died thinking she was alone. I'm worried she was scared and in pain. I should've asked for imaging on Thursday.

I don't know how to help my other (12 y/o) dog and my (8 y/o) cat how to understand that Cheyenne is gone.

Having 10 and 12 y/o dogs, I've been trying to prepare myself. I thought I'd recognize the signs of their final days. I wanted it to comfortable and at home and where the other animals could say goodbye... This felt sudden and painful and scary for Cheyenne. I failed my girl. She was such a great and happy dog and I let her down.",1728253156.0

dogs,Breed help please!!,"**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** 
Top choice is dachshund. From what I’ve read they seem to be affectionate and cuddly, which I am looking for. I also enjoy find them very cute. have started researching miniature poodles due to their intelligence and train ability. 

**What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?** 

I’d like my dog to be someone who keeps me active- I work from home and would like a friend to go out for daily walks and potentially weekend adventures. But the affection is important to me as well.  

**What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?** Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?

I have been a dog sitter for about 3 years with my longest boarding being under 2 weeks. I’ve dogsat puppies that need to taken to the bathroom multiple times throughout the night to senior dogs. I’ve sat papillions, standard poodles, labs, shih tzu, and chihuahuas. I prefer to have smaller-medium sized breeds. 

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?** If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they? 

No

**Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?** 

No

**Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?** What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?

I am currently renting in an apartment and plan to stay here for the next couple of years at minimum. Right next door is a large field that I see many owners exercising their dogs in. No weight or breed restrictions. 

**Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?** How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?

Myself and my partner. I will be main caretaker and my partner is excited. 

**How often do you have visitors to your home?**

Not often- 1x a month if that. 

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?** 

I’d prefer to go through a reputable breeder but open to shelters. 

**Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?** 

I’d prefer a puppy. I plan to invest a lot of time into training my dog and think bonding with them from puppyhood would be important. 

**What size dog are you looking for?** [Here is a size chart for your convenience.](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)
 
36 inches tall max. Prefer small (not tiny) to medium size. My partner and I are not comfortable with a large dog. 

**How much barking is too much barking?** 

Some barking is fine but I live in an apartment, do not want to piss off my neighbors if I can. 

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do?**

A few times a week maximum. Prefer a dog that requires less brushing though. 

**How much shedding do you think you can handle?** Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.

Some shedding is fine- prefer a dog with shorter hair. 

**Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?** 

I am open to doing all at home - also willing to pay for professional grooming as needed. 

**How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?** 

I do not like slobber. Everyone farts right? Not sure how I feel about it lol. 

**How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?** 

As I plan to train my dog well, I’d like them to be eager to please. If they are somewhat independent that is fine- just worried if they are very stubborn. 

**What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?** 

I want them to know all basic commands and if possible, to be able to have them off leash with proper recall. 

**Is there any behavior you can’t accommodate?** 

Not sure if this counts as not accommodating but I am worried about extreme aggression/reactiveness and separation anxiety. Some of the reason I am leaning toward breeder vs shelter. 

**How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?** 

It’s pretty important to me but not a deal breaker. 

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?** 

Maybe 1.5hr a day walking and exercise with toys like throwing balls. I live in tri-state area so worried about exercising in the winter.

**How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?** 

Maybe an hour? I work from home so my schedule is easier. 

**Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?** 

I plan to crate train. If I feel comfortable with letting them freely roam the apartment I would. 

**How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?** 

Likely 1-2 hours during the weekday so I can go to the gym. On weekends maybe a few hours and if longer I can leave at my parents house. 

**If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?** 

I’d likely hire a dog walker but I wfh. 

**What is the general location in which you live?** You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume you’re somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).

NY

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?** Please indicate Celsius or Fahrenheit and the climate of places you may likely live in the future.

Summer:80-90F Winter 20-30F

**On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?**

9- I have wanted to get a dog since 5 years ago but have held off to wait for a time where I am more established and ready for this. I am nervous but excited!

**Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?** 

Yes!!",1728246003.0
dogs,First time owner getting slightly older dog - are these red flags or okay?,"I made enquiries today through a breed-specific Facebook group to try and find a slightly older dog (3-5 years) that needs a new home. I'd prefer to get a slightly older house trained dog rather than handle the puppy stage - although I suspect that dogs for rehoming will most usually have a traumatic past. 

Anyway, a breeder got in touch with me and said she has a 4 year old dog that needs homing. She shared pics and videos of the dog , in which she was petting him, he looked calm and relaxed and happy enough. The dog's circumstances are sad - so I checked if this would be a suitable homing for me as a first-time dog owner, if the dog may have behavioural issues. She didn't respond to this question. There were also a couple of other red flags which I'd appreciate thoughts on: 

-  I asked for customer testimonials and was shown cut and pasted typed references. I was told that she couldn't share contact details for me to contact any of them due myself to privacy issues.  Is this fair enough?

-One of the references mentions how sad it is that the breeder got reported to trading standards and had some of her pups taken away from her by a 'malicious' person. I checked the breeder's website and this looks legit - there is lots of support for her and she has a Go Fund Me to try and appeal the pups being taken from her - but I find it odd that the customer reference she shared mentions and defends this issue.

- the dog that needs homing went to its second  home at 6 months. All was apparently fine there until the owners divorced 16 weeks ago. since then the dog has been 'caged' for most of the day and then again at night time. It has lost much of its fur due to stress, but it is now growing back.

-the dog hasn't been neutered, and was wearing a nappy in the photo. Apparently it has weed in the house but otherwise is trained. She said it's a wise idea to put the nappy things on male dogs if you leave them at home for a bit. Is this right?

dogs,How to help my dog and sister through tragic death,"My sisters dog (2 years old) and my dog (5 years old) were playing in the yard yesterday and i suddenly realised they had gotten out and ran out. Me running out caused my sisters dog to think we were playing and she ran out on the road and got hit by a car. She screamed once and was then quiet as she got into shock. We rushed her to the vet, they stabilised her but after they took x-rays they realised they couldn't save her and she was put down. 

My sister is completely beside herself and I am grieving with her. Everything now is just so horrible and I can believe we will never see her again. I feel so unbearably guilty, if I had just done anything different both dogs would be alive. This dog was everything to my sister and I am trying to be there for her. 

When my sister got her as a puppy, my own dog took her in a her own, cared for her and taught her how to be a dog. They loved eachother, we walked them together and they played together almost every day (we live very close to each other and often took turns looking after both of them). 

My dog saw everything. She is clearly very affected. When I took her out later that day she pulled to go out to the spot and stood and sniffed around the road for many minutes. This morning we were crying and watching a video of my sisters dog ""talking"" and my dog suddenly came running, head and tail high looking around. I feel so bad for her. She lost her best friend and little sister. She has never cared about cars but on her evening walk today she launched aggressively for three cars passing by too close.

We are all grieving and trying to get by this fucking horrible and terrible time. We are going tomorrow to the vet to see her one final time (and to take a paw print) as everything just happened so fast. 

My question is if I should bring my dog with me? To sniff her friend one last time and maybe give her some closure. Will she even smell like herself? Will it help my dog in any way?

dogs,Why Won't my Dog Play Games?,"I have a Siberian husky, he's really energetic even though he's pretty old. Although he's very energetic, he still doesn't play games, fetch, frisbee, nothing. The only thing he plays is fighting. I hit his left or right with my hands and he growls and goes to nibble. Why is that the only thing he plays? And even sometimes he's not in the mood for that. Sometimes I do it, and he just stays still not playing. He only plays with my other dog, why won't he play with me? I know it's not something you can't actually answer, but it's just confusing.

Edit:

Somebody suggested treat puzzles, and he loves treats, so I'll try that.

The other dog is a Morkie, which is a mix of a Maltese and a Yorkshire Terrier. They both are opposites, one has a huge fur coat and loves winter. And the other is hypoallergenic (a dog that has hair not fur) and loves warmer temperatures in stead. We live in a state that generally has all seasons and all temperatures.

Some additional info, he loves other dogs and people. This may sound bad, but he loves to hunt; we have a large backward and he catches a lot of things lurking around in the back.",1728155764.0
dogs,Should I actually use food toppers?,"So I’m a first time dog dad I rehomed my perfect angel 3 weeks ago. He came from a professional show dog kennel where he was very well cared for they have over 20 dogs and many award winners over the last 30 years. He advised I should stick with Purina Pro Sensitive Salmon and rice and give half an apple and or a raw egg once in a while.

So he’s my only one and I do enjoy spoiling him because he’s such a good boy. Have been keeping his toppers to 10% of his diet and rotating them. Only single ingredients, raw egg plus shell, blueberries, salmon oil, ground seaweed for his teeth, sardines in spring water etc. I weigh him once a week.

Are these toppers just making me feel good or are they contributing to his overall health? I just read PP is a complete food maybe these toppers are throwing off his carbs / protein etc. I also treat with rabbit ears and chicken feet. He’s almost 3 and a 31kg male intact Lab ",1728150870.0

Currently we're doing large pressed rawhide, which lasts her around 1-2 days, because she just gnaws on the edges. However, I hear these aren't meant to be good for dogs.

dogs,"[RIP] Lilly, Parti Poodle, 14","Hi everyone. I'm having a hard time coping with the loss of my 14-year old lady today. 

My parents and I got Lilly when I was 21, and she's been a major part of my life since then. Lilly was there for me through a lot of major milestones in my life, and I've been so blessed to have been able to spend tons of time with her since COVID ever since I was able to start WFH. Although I wouldn't say we were inseparable, seeing Lilly was like clockwork for me; always reliable, and always around the same times each day.

Lilly was my heart and soul. She had such character that you couldn't help but fall in love with her very quickly. Lilly was so easy to love on, and was so active and fun; I feel incredibly blessed to have had her in my life all these years. I wish I could have had her longer. 

Lilly's health started going downhill this past August, and since then part of me knew my days with her were numbered. I was really hoping she would have made it through this upcoming winter, but that wasn't meant to be. My parents and I recently returned from vacation, and I was the first one to make it home two hours after my aunt and uncle had gone home. While she was alone, we think she suffered a stroke, because she was disoriented and unable to eat or walk straight without bumping into walls or getting stuck in small spaces. Lilly spent the last three-and-a-half days fighting for every breath, and we hoped that she would start to recover with everything we could reasonably try, such as additional medication, fluids administered by IV, even a low dosage shot of ketamine into her back. Finally, this morning we took her to the vet to put her to rest. We couldn't bare to see her suffer any more than she already had for us. She passed away at 10:53 AM.

Everyone I've talked to about this today says it was the kindest thing we could have done for her. Although I can agree, every fiber of my being feels like it's on fire with wanting to get her to come home. Lilly was lost to us days ago, today was just a final insult. 

I only hope I can see her again someday. I love you so much, Lilly. I always will.

dogs,What breed for a couple and possible future kids?,"Hello 
My boyfriend (26) and I (29) have just bought a house and, with time, would like a dog. I'll use the template to answer some questions. 

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes and no. - it'd be our first dog as adults. 

My boyfriend grew up with a Golden Retriever as a boy till she passed away when he was 22. 

I mostly had cats growing up. My mom adopted a cockerspaniel from a friends family, when I was about 11 years old, which we had for a couple of years till we gave him away to an older couple (because of financial and time issue)
My dad was a dog-trainer in the military but quite the job shortly after I was born. He's had German Shepherds. He got a puppy when I was about 8, but he had to give her away after 2-3 years as his work hours got in the way.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I'd prefer a breeder just because it seems more ""safe"". Both terms of the dogs history and being well socialized, but I've kept an eye on rescue centers too - If we're a good match the breed doesn't matter.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Loving, family dog. It doesn't have to be super outgoing but should be okay around strangers - Not a guard dog!

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I've always loved Collies! Besides that German Shepherds, Bernese Mountain or Golden Retrievers. 
Just smart, cooperative and kind dogs.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Besides the basics it would be nice with some fun tricks. But I'd like good control such as stay command and being able to walk pretty far away. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Maybe agility or obedience just for fun. Possibly some herding of hens which I'd like to have with time - but again just for fun.  

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Besides the daily walks- 15 min of play or training. 

But I also except it to be part of the family in everyday activities - hang out in the garden, visit friends or eating outside a cafe. Especially on weekends.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

At least an hour a day - 20 min morning, afternoon and evening. It'd be walks in the forrest just by our house and in suburban areas. In the weekends I'd hopefully do longer trips - to the ocean. There's no dog parks in my area I'm aware of. 

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Adviced by my dad, I would brush everyday for 2-5 min while on our walk rotating areas. Grooming and cutting hair I'd leave up to professionals 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to big. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

None or little barking. Shedding is okay - I'm used to it. Slobber preferably not.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not important but would like reliable recall. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I love snuggly and cuddly pets! 
But I want a no-bed/couch rule. If cuddles happen I'd lay on the floor or the grass.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please. 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Fairly calm. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I'd do my best and seek help

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Stubbornness and excessive barking.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

6-8 hours 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

There will hopefully be kids in our future. 
Our parents will be able to help taking care of the dog. They retire soon and could watch it some days we are at work. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I want a cat(s) and as mentioned a coop with hens in the backyard.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes. Of all ages.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Denmark. ""Fight dogs"" aren't allowed but I'm not interested in those breeds. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

From -5 C to 25 C -ish. Quite rainy and sometimes snow

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I'm currently studying biology and my BF works 37 hours a week. In 3-4 years I'll work 30-37 hours a week.
 
Our house has a 1,000 m^2 garden by a lake. The neighbors have kids so likely some distraction and noise.

I have ADHD and generally mental health issues. Having pets defiantly helps me. Taking care of them makes me take better care of myself. They rely on me having a rutine which helps me in return. 
I haven't had a cat in 8 years, since it's not allowed in our apartment, and I really miss having a pet. They've helped me through some dark times. I believe a dog would be extra good for me as it needs me to take it for walks - which helps me mentally too. 
So a dog breed good with people who have those struggles would be lovely.

dogs,How do I know when he needs a wee?,"Hello there,

I have the sweetest, most brilliant, adorable 8 month old F1 Labrottie/Rottador/Labrador Rottweiler cross (whatever you want to call it).

We got him at 8 weeks old in March. His 'house training' was effortless and seemingly instinctive. Apart from a handful of accidents, he has always gone outside with basically no direction from me. 

Since we got him the back door has pretty much been permanently open.... It's getting cold now though. The door is shut to keep the heat in and I'm worried that he doesn't know how to tell me he needs to go. What signs should I be looking for that he needs a wee (or poo, although that's more obvious).

I think he can hold it for a very long time (I've known him not to go for 10+ hours), but I'm worried that he might need a wee but doesn't know how to tell me. I'm not worried about him going in the house, I just want to make sure he isn't uncomfortable. 

I'm undoubtedly overthinking this but I'd still love to know what subtle queues there might be in a dog that has never not had access to the outside when I've been home. 

Thanks in advance.

dogs,My best companion,"My first companion, Jack passed in the night earlier this week. 16 years old. Not sick at all. We had just gone on a walk and cuddled. He did his daily walks around the house and backyard. He woke me up by staring at me impatiently(as usual) to tale him downstairs to go outside. I waited a bit but went back to sleep. He tends to enjoy long walks around the backyard so I didn't think anything of it. I woke up a few hours later with a stabbing pain in my chest and back. Got up and came downstairs to see what he was up ti. He wasn't waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs. I walked all around the house looking in his usual spots. Checked the backyard. Started to stress like wtf, I had a thought and went to the backyard and looked on the side of the house and there he was. I'm surprised my neighbor didn't text me cause I know I screamed. Went to wake my kids up freaking out. I just got his ashes back today. My house feels empty even with the other dogs. I feel empty. He was literally my constant companion, the things we've been thru together is insane. I can't even talk about it without crying. In the last 9 months I've lost my dad, my 4 yr old neice and we had to put down our diabetic cat 2 months ago. It's alot. But I thought he'd be here longer. I get alot of ""he lived a full life etc etc"" am I the only one who doesn't find those sentiments comforting? Anyways thank you internet strangers for reading. He was the sweetest sausage of a chihuahua and not the evil kind like my daughters. He loved me so much and I him. ",1728086002.0
dogs,How do I cope with never seeing my baby ever again? ,"I had to leave my toxic family behind and they didn't let me have my dog Lucy. Before this happened, they were considering giving her to me as she was only ever comfortable with me and they didn't want her anymore. But we had a big fight and I finally stood up to then in the heat of the moment. So now, they're just going to get rid of her. I'm now living with other family, so I still have a roof over my head, but it's not the same without Lucy. I just need some help to get through this. I'll have to say goodbye to her as well when I pack my things, it's going to be so painful. I don't know what to do. I don't know if this counts as a low effort post, but I just have nothing else to add, I apologize if so. 

Edit: I'm going to play nice and hope they'll be fooled by it. Then when I have her, it'll be over with them for good. Thank you all for your help. :) 

Edit: Big change of plans. My grandfather took it upon himself to help me. I forgot that the car they've been using is in his name and he let them use it because they are struggling with money due to their own financial mistakes. He decided to make a deal with her, either give the dog or he'll report her to the police for car theft. We'll see how it goes. She could return the car and not return my dog though. I'll try a few other solutions you guys gave me if so. 

Edit: So, she didn't bring the dog. I'll make another post and see if the other options work. 

Edit: So, I tried posting other updates and they haven't been approved yet, so I'll post them here instead. The odds were against me and nothing worked. Then, my parents ended up changing their mind and keeping her, so I would've been able to see her through pictures on my sister's phone. Now, they have changed their minds again and are giving her to my sister, so I'll be able to visit whenever they move out and see her again. I'll actually let them (my sister uses they/them pronouns) have her because she was more bonded with them, so it's for the best. I just hope they'll be able to take good care of her.

dogs,Can someone help me with a training term?,"I'm thinking of a concept in training but the name for it has completely slipped my mind and it's going to drive me crazy.

It's essentially when a dog will do a behavior because it is practiced (and has been previously rewarded), but they are not necessarily doing it because of the reward. Or basically they do something because they've done it 100 times and it's just second nature. 

For example, when I walk my dog in an off leash area, there are spots where I will always call him back and leash him up. I would always give him a treat for this. Now when we walk, when we get to those locations he automatically comes back to be leashed up, regardless if I have a treat or not. 

It would also apply to the concept of loose leash walking or recalls; I've seen some trainers say that training with rewards is inefficient because there are some distractions that will be greater than any reward, but that's not necessarily accurate because of this concept - my dog will recall whether or not I have a steak, for example, because he's done it thousands of times at this point so it is reflexive.

I know ""fluency"" isn't the exact term I was looking for - any other ideas? ",1728052531.0
dogs,Books/media that have helped you through loss of pet? ,"Hello, 

My best friend, my guardian, passed away on Tuesday in my arms. She was battling cancer and was doing pretty well the last few weeks (considering circumstances), but got really ill in the span of 24hs. We took her to the vet, and my heart finally accepted that I would have to say goodbye there. We agreed to put her to sleep, and while the vet went out to get her equipment, she passed away on her own in my arms. Almost like she just wanted us to be OK with letting her go, and she went on her own. I have lost pets before, and grieved all of them. The bond I shared (and still do) with this angel is nothing I have ever experienced before though, and her absence is hitting incredibly hard.

I'm trying to do things that honour her and looking back at fond memories helps ease the pain somewhat. I'm also trying to find some books or anything really that can help me soothe my aching heart and find some comfort.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I have a question for yall- do you leave any sort of gifts for the person watching your pet when you’re away?

dogs,What Dog Breed Should I Get?,"I am a man in my mid 20’s looking for a male puppy.  Can someone please recommend an ideal breed?  I filled out the questionnaire below. 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I had a Yorkie and Maltipoo when I was younger, but my parents did most of the training.  Also, they had pee pads in the house they would go to the bathroom in, whereas I would prefer my dog to go outside.  

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would prefer to get a puppy from a reputable breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* A low maintenance dog that is devoted, protective, affectionate, and easy to train.  Also, I want his breed to have a generally healthy profile.  Finally, I want his energy level to be low-moderate because I don’t want him to get separation anxiety when I’m out or at work. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I’m open to any breed that meets the criteria I’m laying out in this post.  

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Potty training (not going inside and letting me know he has to go outside), sitting, staying, fetching, and to stop barking if I tell him to

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 1-2 hours on weekdays (potentially 3 on some days if I’m not too busy), at least that much on weekends.  

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30-60 minutes a day.  Occasionally we can jog, run, go to the dog park, or even hike but mostly going for walks and playing in the yard or indoors.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am willing to brush once or twice a week but would prefer to do less.  I would be willing to learn how to clean his ears but would leave hair trimming to a professional (hopefully not too often). 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* A medium-large sized dog, anywhere in the range of 25-85 pounds.  

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I want to keep shedding and slobber to an absolute minimum.  I would prefer a dog that isn’t overly vocal and only occasionally barks to alert me so he could function as a watchdog (for example, if there is an attempted break in during the middle of the night he can wake me up).

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be nice, especially at the dog park or in my front yard.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in the middle, I love cuddling and petting dogs and occasionally sleeping in my bed with them but there are times that I need personal space as well.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I prefer a dog that is independent enough to be able to entertain itself and doesn’t need my constant attention  24/7.  However, not indifferent to the extent that a cat is (no shade to cats, I like them in their own right but I want something different), I still want some enthusiasm when I get home or want to spend time with him.  

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don’t mind if he barks at someone knocking on the door or someone he doesn’t know entering the yard.  However, if he sees that I am comfortable with someone (friends, family, etc.) he should be friendly as well, or at least not antagonistic and open to warming up to them.  

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Somewhat, although I would like to avoid an overly aggressive breed if possible.  

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work a 9-5 so he would have to be okay being alone while I’m at work.  I do plan on spending quality time with him every day, more so on the weekends, but even then I’m not the kind of person to bring my dog with me everywhere I go out.  

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone right now, but am seriously considering moving in with either my friend or my girlfriend in the not so far future when my lease is up.  My friends and girlfriend would be okay with it and would help me take care of him but of course the main workload is still mine.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* My girlfriend has a cat, so my dog would have to coexist with him.  My sister has a smaller dog (less than 15 pounds) so hopefully they could coexist as well.  I don’t care if he hates small non-pet animals like squirrels or rodents.  In fact, that could be good for pest control.  

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No, so he doesn’t have to be the best with kids when he does interact with them, but of course I don’t want a dog prone to being aggressive towards kids either.  

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* N/A

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* The US, no I’m not.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Mid 60s-high 80s in the summer, mid 30s-mid 50s in the winter

dogs,My reactive dog keeps escaping,"Some background info on my dog. We adopted him from the shelter at 8 months old, and he has been a bit fearful from the start, but with training and time he has gotten over most of his fears. He also has a very strong prey drive and has caught multiple rabbits, and tries to chase anything other than dogs and people, including cats. He used to be quite friendly with other dogs, but after having multiple encounters with aggressive dogs he has started to become aggressive back towards them, especially larger dogs.

Since we got him he has found new ways to escape our house/yard every time we try to fix it. He would make a hole under the fence, so we fixed those. Then he used found ways to bounce off objects and go over our fence, so we solved those. Somewhat more recently he was able to just clear the fence, so we have him on leash at all times in our yard. Today he jumped off our raised patio(which is several feet off the ground) and over our fence to escape. He also takes any opportunity he gets when someone is our household fails to completely close a door.

At nearly 5 years old, he has gotten to be quite aggressive with certain dogs and will try to escape our yard to go pick a fight with them. It has gotten to the point that I'm concerned for his safety and the safety of other pets in our neighborhood. I try really hard to make sure that he doesn't escape and he is never intentionally let off leash, but he somehow manages to find the rare opportunity when someone is forgetful.

I'm really not sure what to do to train him better or what else can be done to keep him from escaping and I could really use some advice.

dogs,Am I wrong in this situation? (dog park interaction),"I know that dog parks are a controversial subject. While they pose safety risks to owners, children, and other dogs, it seems there are a few ways to combat potentially negative interactions at dog parks (besides not going). Unfortunately I had a bad experience today and would appreciate some insight. I am a first time dog owner, so please be kind with your responses.

My dog is a 5yo male chihuahua/rat terrier mix. He has fear based tendencies toward other dogs, most notably correcting them if they run up to him too fast or spook him from behind. He might nip at the other dog in that case, but he has never attacked or bitten another dog. This is because he was attacked by an off-leash dog in a local neighborhood several years ago while he was on leash. He's mostly okay around other dogs, he just prefers not to be around them. If someone brings their dog into the same off-leash space, my dog will ignore them until we leave the space as fast as we can. Please note that I never let him off-leash on walks or at a park unless we are the only ones using the gated space. 

Today, I took him to a park that has three gated areas for mixed size dogs. Two small dogs were in one, a few large breeds in the other, and none in the third. I brought my dog in and let him run for all of about two minutes before someone showed up with their golden retriever. At this point I am across the space from the gate picking up his poop when I see the guy approaching the gate to the same space. I kindly shouted ""My dog is not the friendliest, so we will leave and let you have the space. I just need to get over there to put his leash on real quick."" He says ""okay"" and proceeds to release his dog off-leash. I guess I thought maybe he would wait for us to leave before entering to avoid conflict? As I'm approaching the gate, he says ""so what's your problem? your dog isn't friendly?"" to which I said ""not most of the time, unfortunately"" and  led my dog away while holding onto his harness. My dog is not showing any interest in his while this interaction takes place as he is pretty familiar with the protocol. Dogs = leave. I was a little bit offended by his tone, but figured he was an old man who doesn't understand what it's like to have a slightly reactive dog. I understand that dog parks are designed for friendlier dogs, but the way he released his dog anyway after my warning felt a bit entitled. This could've been avoided if I were closer to the gate and could've taken mine out before they even came in so as to ""give"" them the space. That's what I would've preferred to do, but I had a hand full of poop, lol.

As we are walking out, I see a young couple with their puppy approaching the gates. The woman chimes in ""I always thought it was common courtesy that if you know your dog isn't friendly you don't let them in there."" I was taken back by this a little bit, because to me I had done everything in my knowledge to successfully avoid conflict between any dogs. I let the guy know BEFORE he let his dog enter, I promptly guided my dog out of the space, and chose to walk him around the park instead. Plus, we were in there for all of two minutes, not like we were somehow hogging the space. I saw an opportunity for my dog to roam free and took it, and then responded accordingly when that was no longer possible. Am I wrong? 

I guess I feel a bit discouraged. Not everyone's dog can be raised from puppyhood to have a perfect, social personality. My dog is not an immediate threat to anyone elses unless he is approached in a way that freaks him out. He's okay with a brief greeting, but other than that he just wants to be left alone. It's not fair for him to only be allowed to walk on leash for the rest of his life as we sadly do not have a backyard. 

My dog is a rescue and I am just trying to make sure he gets good exercise while having consideration for others who have dogs better suited for socialization. I didn't ask the guy to use a different space, but instead let my pup have his two minutes of ""freedom"" before leaving. I always try to find spaces where there are no other dogs running around, as opposed to other owners who let their reactive dogs attack and potentially hurt others (I don't think mine would ever do this, but that is why I try to avoid it even being possible if I can). Sure, I could take him to the park at 6am when no one else is around, but there will always be the possibility of interactions like this. 

Am I wrong for bringing my dog to the park? I feel really guilty for even taking him.. but he deserves it as much as social dogs do, too. He didn't do anything wrong. I wish there were dog parks with smaller gated spaces for one person/dog to occupy at a time. That would avoid so much risk! 

I appreciate any advice from others who might've had similar encounters. Unfortunately I haven't found any places to take him off-leash nearby where there won't be other dogs. Training in my area costs $3000+ which simply isn't possible for us. Besides, I don't think a dog correcting another one is inherently wrong, but it's embarrassing and not appropriate to other owners, hence why I try to avoid it. 

Thank you in advance!",1727913213.0
dogs,Breed Recommendation: Medium / First Time Adult Owner,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First as an adult/primary caregiver. Owned dogs growing up as a child, but never on my own.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I am open to either option. Prefer to rescue if the fit is right. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Medium in size (40-55~ lbs) - Friendly with people/animals, likes to be active, but doesn't require non-stop attention and can be okay on their own.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Aussies due to their size/activity and smarts. Labs (though typical size could be a bit more than wanting). ""Spitz"" breeds due to the fox like appearance (Finnish Spitz, Icelandic Sheepdog, etc.)

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Primarily the basic commands (come, sit, leave it, down, etc.) - good leash manners. Fetch/catch. Not really looking for agility training/sporting activities. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No work/sporting plans. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Multiple hours. I work from home and tend to have pockets of time throughout my day to interact with the dog each day. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours (as weather allows) - I am rather active and take a large number of walks each day. This would include dog park activities as some are near me.

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I would like to do as much of this myself within reason. For tasks outside of my skillset I would pay professionally. Ideally no more than monthly/every few months. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium (thinking 40-55ish lbs) 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I am okay with shedding as I know what I am signing up for. Prefer less barking/slobbering.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This would be nice, but also not a show stopper. I have a fenced in back yard of decent size, and city-ordinance is on-leash in all public areas. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Mix of both? Not looking for super clingy/velcro 100% of the time, but don't want 100% aloof either. A healthy mix would be nice

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Similar to above, a mix would be ideal, but realize that might be asking too much. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Calm but cautious? Definitely not aggressive or fearful. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. Many other dogs in my area and wouldn't want to cause an issue. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Overly aggressive. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Vary depending on the day, but working from home they wouldn't be left alone often. I would plan to take the dog on any extended trips. Handful of hours every now and again.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone (no kids/partner that lives with). I do have a girlfriend that also has a dog (2.5 year old Aussie). 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* None of my own, or that live in the house. Girlfriend's Aussie that they would interact with

* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I do not rent. Own my home with a fenced in back yard. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Nebraska - and my city does not have any breed-specific dog bans. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Average in July - 89 F
* Average in Dec, Jan, Feb - mid 30's F

dogs,I don’t know what toys to get my dog,"I adopted a dog a little over 2 weeks and slowly but surely his personality is starting to reveal itself. It’s been a real joy, but one thing I can’t figure out is what kind of toys to get for him.

He’s a Border collie/Saint Bernard, about 50 pounds and likely getting bigger. His favorite things to do with toys are to meticulously chew at the seams of them to rip them open, to chew off any soft pieces that stick out from the toy, and to thrash them around/whip them back and forth. He also loves shredding things Ike cardboard and paper. That said, he’s actually incredibly gentle and doesn’t even bite toys hard enough to make them squeak, so he’s shown no interest in harder rubber-like toys like kongs or the ones you’d get in the super chewer bark box.

I feel like I can’t buy him toys for chewers, but I can’t buy him plush toys either. I’m worried if I got him a rope he’d just chew on the ends of it and pull out/eat the threads. He loves his chuck-it balls and holee-roller, but I’d like him to have more options than that. The only other toy that’s lasted is the bark box Cactus that has another toy inside of it.

Every morning (6:30) I take her for a half an hour to the dog park. We’re there alone. Because she doesn’t like to play much, I toss her kibble into the grass for her to sniff out, so she has at least mental stimulation.

Then after 2pm, when I come home, I take her to a different dog park, where we sometimes meet her playmates, sometimes I throw her a stick (which she brings back max 10 times), we do obedience and she sniffs. I try to make it an hour session everytime.

Then around 6pm, we go on a walk. Usually an hour/hour and a half.

We live in a flat, that is why I try to be outside with her as much as I can.

Maybe you’ll say that she has enough exercise and that is why she just lays and sleeps beside her time outside, but she doesnt like to do much, even when it is raining and we don’t go out (only for potty). She hates rain and refuses to walk in it.

Any thoughts?",1727856475.0
dogs,"My first foster has been adopted, and I am in heaven ","Hi !
I had no idea which flair to put... I am sorry.

In 14 february I had my first foster ! A bearded border collie, a breeder made too much puppies and couldn't get right of 16 of them... so he gave them to an organisation. They passed their first years in a container, only with dog, surrounded by dog. Never touched, nothing. They travelled 3 days, and he came to me.

7/8 months of work ! Making him discover the world, teaching him the language of human... the gear, potty training etc. It was also kinda fun, because he only knew border collie... other breed would scare him a bit !

He left mid September. The family dreamed about a dog they could take him to their job at clients houses, walking him off leash, going to big walk, travelling with it, that goes along with their cat,etc. Aaaand I am so proud of my foster, because, he is realizing their dream.
He had so much hard time with human, and now ?? He loves going to work, he loves meeting new people, and even be happy when he meet new human !! 
They walk him off leash In the village ( it's in the French country side ) !
I am so happy, because all the hard work paid off, and because they are so happy !

I posted about my trouble some months ago.
I just wanted to share am adventure I am so proud !

Please have a nice day !! ",1727851774.0

Medium to large, ideally want a decent sized dog 

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Important would want the dog to be able to wander but know where not to go

dogs,indestructable fleas!!!,"

I've had my puppy for almost two months now and he's had fleas the entire time! They are indestructable!! I feel so bad for him because I know he's so uncomfortable.

I've washed and vacuumed everything in the house (making sure to empty the vacuum outside and take it's remnants to the garbage can), given him simparica trio on sept. 2nd (next dose is tomorrow), given him two flea baths, and then this last weekend we flea bombed our house followed with washing EVERYTHING and vacuuming EVERYTHING and while we were letting it air out I took him to PetSmart for a third flea bath!! (This was on Sunday)

Today, he's infested with them again.

I'm at a loss. What can I do? 

He is miserable :( 

Please help me!!",1727841879.0
dogs,Are Irish terriers generally bad with other dogs? ,"I walk this Irish terrier every week. I love her, she’s loving, smart and cheeky (she “talks”, which I find hilarious). 
However, she’s really not great with other dogs. She’ll never lunge or chase a dog, but HATES it if a dog comes up behind her or runs up to her- she snaps. The owner warned me that she doesn’t like other dogs, so we’ve been good at keeping our distance. The only time she really freaked out is when a teenager couldn’t control his young bully-type dog who lunged at her repeatedly and kept jumping up on me when I picked her up. But that’s another story. 
I spoke to some friends and two of them have said they know Irish terriers who have a similar trait- amazing with humans, but hates other dogs.

Is this a common thing with this breed? I’m curious to hear from others! ",1727812629.0
dogs,What breed is my dog?,"I adopted a 5-6 month old puppy from a rescue last month. He was found on the street with his sisters in TJ and was taken in by a good samaritan before being transferred to an LA rescue. He is an absolute sweetheart with such a good temperament! We were originally told that he was a Maltese/Terrier mix, but now that we've had him for a while, I'm not so sure anymore. People have told us that he looks like a Coton de Tulear, and he does express a lot of the behavioral traits of one (standing on hind legs, etc.). His fur is also very soft and cotton-like, with the wiry Terrier texture down the middle of his back. We are certain he is part terrier due to his athleticism, beige coloring, and fur texture, but am interested in knowing the other parts. Any thoughts?

More info for potential ID:

Fur color- white body with beige back, tail, and ears

Weight- 13lb but still growing

dogs,Did anyone else’s dog become suddenly aggressive to other household pets right at the end of your pregnancy and did that go away after the baby was born?,"We have a 8ish year old coonhound who is normally pretty chill with our other dogs. She's had food resource guarding issues around one of them but we are actually rehoming that dog and he is leaving us this weekend. The remaining dog and our coonhound have never had issues getting along.

I am 38 weeks pregnant today and over the last month our coonhound has been increasingly irritable. Extremely demanding, pushy, vocal, etc. In the last two weeks she has picked three fights with our other dog, the one we are keeping. Two of them she was clearly resource guarding me, and the third was food related (she was hungry, we had started cooking, and our other dog got too close to the baby gate closing off the kitchen). No one was bitten during any of the fights. She also guarded the deck today from our third dog (the one leaving us) which she's also never done and was very unusual behavior. He just tried to walk past her out the door and twice she refused and guarded the door. It didn't escalate into a legit fight because I split them up but still it was strange behavior. In that instance the dog we are keeping was with her the whole time and she didn't care about him at all. 

The changes in her routine I could see being upsetting to her because she is very routine oriented but those things all changed over the course of this entire pregnancy and none of them have changed recently. She has been pretty normal this whole time up until the last month. A little stir crazy sometimes but not aggressive or anything close to it.

We have a vet appointment for her on Friday to rule out any physical issues.

I am really freaking out about this because our coonhound is also extremely maternal and very interested in babies and now I am scared she's going to resource guard the baby from our other dog. Because they hadn't had issues previously we didn't think it would be a problem but now I just don't know. She gets this psychotic like feral glint in her eyes when she goes after him that I've never seen before. Like I look at her and don't recognize her and it really freaks me out. It also scares me that it's unpredictable. The last one, she was sitting next to me on the couch and went after him for just walking too close to me. But literally the day before he was in between her and me on the couch sleeping in my lap all afternoon and she didn't care one bit. She was actually using him as a pillow!

I feel like I was robbed of my breeder experience since that was my first time, I've rescued before than, and just would like to try again but wanna do everything I can to never have that experience again. I'm looking at the Shiloh Shepherd, they have the smarts of a german shepherd and multiple breeders are working to breed out many of the common diseases that german shepherds have (which was my last dog.) Plus I'm in love with the friendly personality. I have done a weeks worth of research so far and landed on JnL Pocono Shilohs, EKHOHAUS SHILOH SHEPHERDS, and Shilohs of the Salish Sea. They seem wonderful and do all of there proper health testing and are members of the Shiloh dog club. Is this enough?

dogs,My Schnauzer died unexpectedly this weekend. I'm just devastated,"Miss Stella was the gentlest dog I've ever known. People who met her used to say how she seemed timid and standoffish, but I always knew she was only being polite just before absolutely & unapologetically smothering complete strangers in love & cuddles. Without fail, she'd be flopped across her new friend's lap in 10 mins or less, licking their fingers and demanding a tummy rub or 3.

Over the weekend, we were having a quiet night at home. I left the living room for 30 mins or so to make dinner and when I returned I found that she had gotten into a bag of beef jerky that I thought I had left out of reach. She had swallowed a moisture pack whole and choked with her head still in the bag. I still have no idea how long she was lying there before I found her.

I can't stop playing that scene thru my head now: digging the plastic out of her mouth, trying over and over to revive her with CPR, scream crying on the phone with my mom while i held her... I can't shake this guilty feeling that I both caused this and couldn't save her. I feel even more horrible for my younger Schnauzer, Daisy, who's always had her friend around but is now sitting all alone at home as i type this at work.

dogs,Recommend a chill small breed (tired after having a reactive big one),"Introduction

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No I had a big mixed breed dog. I thought that he was perfect except the fact that he was reactive to dogs, lunging but no barking. It was excitement, not aggression. So, very big dog with reactivity = life is a living hell. Trainers didn't get any sense to him and I tried so freaking hard with no success... so we just avoided dogs. I miss having a dog though. My childhood dogs were both reactive (aggression, not excitement), they were small ones so I know the breed doesn't really matter. I was a kid, didn't know how to handle it. But after my own dog became reactive, I though that am I the problem? But then there are my friends who have such easy pups, tell me how they didn't do much and the dogs are just angels. I want that...

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* Breeder this time please

3. Describe your ideal dog.

* A good buddy that would handle going with me everywhere. Meeting friends, going to various different hiking spots or nature trails, shopping, chilling in the office. I just want a companion that is kind to everybody but not too interested. I need a dog that would be easier to handle, for me and my mom who helps sometimes.

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* A small dog would be nice. I don't want a big dog anymore, even though I love their personalities a bit more.  Not sure what breeds would be the calmest. I heard cavaliers are cool but I don't want a sick breed. Is there anything similar to that?

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just how to behave and maybe some tricks.

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Nope.

Care Commitments

7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 4-8 hours, depends a lot on the day

8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* Walking around 1,5+ hours on a weekday, 2+ hours or more on weekends. Less if that's too much for a small fellow. I would not be using a dog park. Playing in the garden too.

9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I think I'd do it myself. I could brush a couple times a week.

Personal Preferences

10. What size dog are you looking for?

* Small or smaller medium.

11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I'm used to heavy shedding so not a problem. Some barking is fine but not sure my coworkers would like that. Slobber is fine.

12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Quite important, I'd love walks in forests off leash from time to time.

Dog Personality and Behavior

13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly is better but not a dealbreaker.

14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Don't care as long as I can teach the dog the basics.

15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* Going to look what is going on, getting some pets. Some barking is okay at first.

16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Medium sized, medium-long coat dog that will be a companion going out to places, lots of walks and trips to the local beach, parks etc and a dog that can be both inside and outside

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Australian Shepherd as we are in Australia so we see many, they are the correct size and have a beautiful look and temperament. I'm also fond of Belgian mallinois, border collies and larger dogs like German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans etc but they may be better suited later on after more experience training and owning dogs myself

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The basics of sit, stay, shake. Some more advanced tricks, I'm very interested in the training aspect so I'd love to be able to train the dog to follow me by my side without a leash and come to me on command (at home and in off leash environments, I'd always keep it on a leash otherwise)

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No competing or work for the dog

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Minimum one hour everyday, longer on days I don't work, I'm very interested in the training aspect so I would spend longer on this in addition to playing and walking, as well as smaller interactions many times a day, the dog would be well a part of the family

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Minimum one hour everyday with a walk, and taking it to a dog park once a week ideally, and playing with the dog in the backyard daily.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

**Personal Preferences**

* Medium size

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Average amount of shedding, average amount of barking but ideally kept to a minimum as the property has close neighbours

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in the middle is fine

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Given that I'm very interested in training I'd say eager to please

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

* A guarding presence would be nice, but friendly once it knows everything is safe, but it isn't extremely necessary if the dog doesn't have much of a guarding demeanour

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes, but my partner would be much more comfortable with a dog that isn't aggressive so that is also a consideration

* No

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Maximum of 8 hours if me and my partner are both gone for work, but some days we have separate off days so it may only be alone for a few days of the week during that time period 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My partner has similar preferences to me but they aren't interested in training the dog anymore than toilet training/basics, they will mainly take it for walks or play it with/accompany it with me

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We plan on having a cat as well in the future

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

**Additional Information and Questions**

25)	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* As previously mentioned, I work in a pet store so I interact with dogs daily and have been trained on their requirements and behaviour, so I feel like I have a good foundation on owning a dog. I also have a large employee discount so there's no barrier to providing high quality products for the dog",1727699921.0

dogs,Failed Re-homing Due to Dog Meeting: Was there a problem? ,"My family and I recently decided to adopt another dog. We have one already and were told the two would need to meet as part of the adoption process.

Here is a quick description of her if anyone thinks it relevant, otherwise skip ahead.

>!She is a small mongrel from Cyprus that was picked up at around 8 months living in a field and brought to the UK as a rescue. We adopted her while we had another rescue, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, who died 2 years ago. They enjoyed each other's company and got on well, mainly sleeping together, occasionally playing, but for the most part minding their own business. As a younger dog she played a lot with other dogs on walks, but as she's grown up she has become rather aloof and does not play with many other dogs. She is happy to greet them before going back to sniffing and chasing squirrels. She is usually very submissive with other dogs, rolling over if a big dog charges at her. She has bared her teeth one or two times when she can't escape, but never anything more, always with her tail tucked and never having approached the other dog.!<

Here is a quick description of the dog we visited if anyone thinks it's relevant, otherwise skip ahead to the 'incident'.

>!The dog we went to visit was a female Staffordshire Bull Terrier, 1.5 years old. No history or records on her. Needs were: no children under 12. Walked every day. Can live with other dogs but doesn't have to. Described as anxious around new people and easily scared. However came into the pen like a heat-seeking missile and launched herself onto our laps, licking our faces and enjoying being stroked and scratched. Easy to calm down with some soft words and would sit quietly and contentedly having her neck scratched. Clearly has a lot of energy after being in her kennel all day, but isn't manic/hugely over-stimulated. She was also un-spayed and in heat, which may or may not be relevant.!<

The two dogs were introduced on-lead in a field. Both dogs wagged their tails and sniffed one another before mainly investigating the grass as we walked on. Little further interaction other than sniffing where the other urinated.

Now the 'behavioural specialist' arrives for our dog to be off-lead and an assessment. Once again, dogs wag tails and sniff one another upon meeting, and spend the next 10 minutes sniffing the grass and running around, sometimes side by side, but with little other interaction. **At this point the Staff wants to play, and runs up behind our dog (in a playful manner - tail-wagging, bouncy step, but in the way Staffs want to play, i.e. about to shoulder barge and leading with her mouth). Our lets out a growl and opens her mouth, standing tall. The staff takes a step back with her own mouth open, and for a second the two look at each other, before mutually turning away, and resuming sniffing the grass, hackles go down, and run around independently etc.** Neither dog snapped their mouth closed or made contact with the other. It was single growl that stopped as soon as the Staff backed off. In the next 10 minutes they do get close to one another, sniffing the same piece of grass at times, but do not really interact any further.

The behaviour specialist claimed it was not the correct way for her to have communicated, and that ""she is no longer in the wild and does not need to show the full spectrum of dog behaviour"". Suggested that we waited too long before getting another dog (an insensitive comment I thought - the previous dog was dearly loved and we all felt very sad after having him put down, 2 years ago to the day). The meeting was therefore considered unsuccessful, and the re-homing application was denied.

*Are other dog owners in agreement that such an incident is poor behaviour from a dog? And also an indicator that 2 dogs are unlikely to get along?* If so, I have been totally misinterpreting canine behaviour for years - I was pleased by the interaction and I thought it showed successful communication between 2 dogs when one wanted to play and the other didn't. I see it happen every day and have never thought anything of it, and used to welcome other dogs telling mine off in the same manner when she was young and over-confident with them.",1727690008.0

dogs,dog park etiquette ,"I‘ve been at the dog park for all of 15 minutes and I’ve already seen two dog owners looking at their phones while their dogs were pooping. Neither person noticed their dog defecating so neither cleaned it up, absolutely infuriating me. What do you do in these situations? I fear that confronting people won’t go well, but I also don’t feel like I should have to clean up other dogs shit. Suggestions? 


edit: I feel like a lot of people who are like “It’s easy! Just say something!” have to be men, who are generally listened to and respected in society. Almost every single time when I confront someone about 1) picking up after their dog or 2) keeping their dog leashed unless at a designated off-leash location, *I’m* made out to be the aggressor and I’m honestly just tired of it. ",1727654841.0
dogs,Large(ish) Apartment Dogs?,"Introduction

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* It will be my first personal dog, but I have experience working at a boarding kennel and occasionally lending a hand in obedience training family members’ dogs. I also have pet-sitting experience, and while it wasn’t my own personal dog, I helped my grandparents raise a Shih Tzu (trained, fed, played, walked, brushed her).

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* No major preference, but a well-bred dog would be nice for temperament’s sake. I don’t want to take a risk with reactivity to smaller animals, so if I would get a shelter dog I’d make sure they’re cat-friendly.

3. Describe your ideal dog.

* (Highly) Trainable, sociable with their family, **cat-friendly**. I’d like to have a dog that could hang on the couch with me, or be down to explore the city—maybe hike on rarer occasions! Mostly, though, I’m looking for a mellow cuddle buddy that can also learn cool tricks. A dog that can play, but knows when to settle down or be gentle around smaller animals. I work from home, so separation isn’t a huge issue, but I’d like to avoid one prone to destructive tendencies/separation anxiety when left home alone for several hours. I’m perfectly fine with crate-training as well. Cat-friendly is a must, since we have one feline resident already with another on the way this upcoming month.

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Both my partner and I are fans of medium-large sized breeds. Breeds I’ve been looking into are Rough/Smooth Collies, Golden Retrievers, and Eurasiers. I love other Spitz breeds (such as Chows and Samoyeds), Borzois, and have experience with Dobermans (my favorite breed) but am unsure if they’d be an ideal fit for our lifestyle as of now. My partner’s favorite breeds are Basset Hounds, Labradors, Shar Peis and Golden Retrievers, but I’m trying to avoid Bassets/Shar Peis for the meanwhile due to their health issues. A small breed isn’t a dealbreaker, but we’d like a dog that could be roughhoused with during playtime.

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I love teaching dogs obedience training and “neat tricks” in general. I might be interested in agility work but am not 100% set on it. I’m wanting a dog that will obey commands, so biddability is huge. Optimally, I could find a breed that will take well to Service Animal work, as I’m disabled—again, not a dealbreaker, but it could be a huge bonus.

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I’ve taught a good handful of dogs obedience commands over the years and would like to hone in on that ability via my own dog. I have no experience in agility but think it could be fun to get into!

Care Commitments

7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I’d like to interact with my dog for most of the time that I’m home! I prefer having a lap animal as opposed to one that doesn’t want anything to do with me, but if a dog just wants to lay near me on the couch that’s fine too. Ideally I’d want to dedicate an hour or two each per day to training and playing, though I’d be available for a bit more time on the weekends.

8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* By the time we’d get the dog we could very well be living in another residence with a yard. For the time being, though, we live in an apartment with a dog park nearby. Otherwise, neighborhood walks, occasional hikes, and fetch.

9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I’d be comfortable with everything but trimming hair! I’d go to a professional for that. I don’t mind brushing at all since I’ve lived with a Shih Tzu before.

Personal Preferences

10. What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium-large size

11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is no problem. Slobber isn’t my thing. I can handle some barking, such as “conversing” with me through barks, but I can’t handle excessive barking at 3 AM, or anytime a neighbor walks by.

12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not very important

Dog Personality and Behavior

13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I wouldn’t mind a bit of both! I love cuddly dogs but am fine if they want to do their own thing here and there. I don’t want a dog that wants nothing to do with me or my family, but I have a cat or two to keep me company should the dog want their own “me-time”.

14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please would definitely be great for training, but I really don’t mind independence, either—I’m a cat owner. I get it.

15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* An alert bark or two is fine if they’re coming up to the door, but I’d prefer them to stay calm upon someone entering (though, that typically comes with training, of course). Whether they’re aloof to strangers or come right up to them doesn’t matter to me.

16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I’d rather not. I would like to live in a multi-dog household eventually, and I have a few family members wanting “doggy playdates” once I do get a dog.

17. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I want to avoid separation anxiety and animal aggression entirely. In the future, I hope to own other animals, and want to keep conflicts at a minimum.

Lifestyle

18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work from home, but go out just about every other day. A standard amount spent without humans present would maybe be 4-5 hours when I’m out?

19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* We’ll be splitting pet care 50/50. My partner likes dogs that can play hard but have an off-switch, and enjoys “goofy” dogs in general. Dogs that act silly and are perhaps lacking a few qualifications in the thinking department are his favorites—really, he’s just looking for a buddy to watch TV and tussle with. Happy-go-lucky.

20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have a dog-savvy cat! He came from a foster home with several dogs and got along just fine with them. I have another cat on the way, who is also from a multi-pet household. Eventually, a good bit further into the future, I’d like to keep reptiles/fish/insects.

21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not planning on it. Though, there are children in my family, should I ever want to bring my dog to a social gathering or should one of my relatives bring their kids over. Being able to tolerate older children at the least would be a plus.

22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We’re renters! By the time we get a dog, we may very well be living in another apartment, as mentioned above. Since we’re not planning on getting a dog now, just assume there’s no restrictions! Just looking for suggestions, after all :)

23. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA resident here! There are no cases of any breed bans in my state or city.

24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* The weather here is fairly moderate. Average summer days are 70-80 F, with the hottest of days MAYBE approaching 90. Winter days are are a bit harsher, being anywhere from 30-40 on average, and 10-25 on more extreme days.

Additional Information and Questions

25. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Emphasis on the not getting a dog now part!! There will at minimum be another year before we get one.

26. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* Anything you wish you knew before owning a dog? Any tips for introducing a dog to a feline household? For any of the aforementioned dog breeds, is there anything people neglected telling you about the breed before you got one?",1727649357.0

Additional Information and Questions
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. 
My dad generally doesn’t like most small dogs, he cannot stand the aggressive and defensive manor of most of them. He often talks about wishing he could find a small dog that would love him unconditionally as well as being friendly with others. 
Small fluffy dogs are a very hard no because my lab/pit was attacked by a flock of off leash yorkies as a puppy and now he is extremely defensive and aggressive with them (the only time he’s ever that way). He is extremely friendly with other small dogs as long as they don’t resemble a yorkie. 
This dog would be very babied, and coddled. Spend 90% of its time inside unless it’s ideal weather outside. He really just wants a cuddler.  
He used to have a dachshund mix that was his sweetheart, she passed away 3 years ago and he’s missed her ever since. He just got through cancer this year and he’s been quite the depressed homebody since then, which has made him miss her much more. 
Oh ya, he doesn’t like pugs.

I don’t know, I guess I’m worried if I’m missing something or if a delayed response to him not coming back is going to happen and the best ways to support her.",1727541773.0

dogs,Help finding the right dog breed,"My partner and I are looking for a dog but could use some advice when it comes to breeds, we greatly appreciate any help!

**Introduction**

1\)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I had a family dog that I helped to train/raise, but it will be my partner's first dog.

2\)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Reputable breeder

3\)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Intelligent, loyal, trainable, and gentle. A dog that can thrive in a family suburban environment, with both weekend hiking adventures and relaxing days at home. Mid-sized, anywhere between 35-75 lbs.

4\)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* This is where we need some help! So far we've mainly looked at Shepherds and Retrievers. My partner and I are drawn to breeds like Australian Shepherds (or MAS) and Duck Tolling Retrievers, as we've met some we really like, and they seem to be the right combination of size, friendly temperament, and trainability.

5\)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Primarily obedience training (allowing for things like traveling together, camping, going various public places without concern), but my partner is also interested in agility courses.

6\) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No, but my partner is interested in agility sport, just not competitive.

**Care Commitments**

7\) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* At least an hour walk/play each day, along with 30-60 minutes of training. My partner works from home and I work close to home so the dog would rarely be left alone for more than 4 hours.

8\) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* One hour, minimum. We have extensive trails and an off leash dog park nearby.

9\)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Weekly brushing. I don't have any experience grooming. We could take the dog to a professional groomer if needed but that's not preferred (at least regularly).

**Personal Preferences**

10\)	What size dog are you looking for?

* 35-75 lbs. Not super small, not super big.

11\) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding: Can handle medium shedding, like that with average double coat breeds.

* Barking: Excessive barking is a concern. Alert barking is fine, but barking which doesn't stop could be a problem.

* Slobber: Average slobber is fine.

12\) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Extremely important. We are looking for a dog we can trust off-leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13\) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Either is fine, or a mix of both! Neither is a dealbreaker.

14\) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More on the side of Eager-to-please.

15\) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* A bark to alert is good, but then once I acknowledge and respond it would stop. I would prefer the dog is cautious/alert but friendly to strangers.

16\) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. We have hundreds of dogs in our neighborhood and need a dog that can get along with its neighbor dogs. It will have plenty of dog-friends!

17\) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Overly-reactive behavior, destructive separation anxiety, excessive (beyond normal) barking.

**Lifestyle**

18\) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 3-4 times a week the dog may be left alone for 4-5 hours. Partner works from home so most days someone will always be home.

19\) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Both partner and I are dog lovers, and are both committed to doing the required work (feeding, cleaning, exercising, training, etc).

20\) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Planning on getting a cat eventually.

21\) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, we plan to have children in the future, I have young relatives, and there are children in the neighborhood.

22\) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No, I own my home with a sizable lot with plenty of room for the dog to run.

23\) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Minnesota, USA. No.

24\) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Hot summers , cold winters (Minnesota, USA). The dog would need to be able to go on walks in the snow in the cold.",1727535073.0

dogs,Dog is impatient with electric door and may break it soon,"We just put in an electric door to help a small dog we just got in and out of the house and it’s worked well for that.  U fortunately my bigger older dog, who’s quickly learned how to use the door, didn’t wait for it to open all the way before he starts going through.  He almost wants to help it open.

Only had the door for about three weeks and I can already here that something is wrong with the door.  Seems like only a matter of time before it breaks.  

Any idea whether I can train my bigger dog?  Do I just take her to the door, hold her, then let her in once the door is fully open…over and over again?",1727529236.0
dogs,My dog is bored out of his mind,"I adopted a Maltese dog about little over a year ago. His previous owners threw him out and he was in a pretty rough shape, but now he’s doing ok health and nutrition wise. In the beginning he w
as pretty difficult and anxious and a very picky eater, which took a few months to resolve but now that everything is fine he seems bored all the time.

I suffer from depression myself and work from home so I don’t go out much. But I take him on a walk at least once a day and aside from that he doesn’t do any other activities. He is not interested in toys, does not like treats and does not like sitting idles next to me on the couch for more than 5 minutes. 

I don’t know what to do to entertain him. He just walks around the apartment all day. Sometimes when I’m playing on my PS he just walks around the room in circles. While I’m working he sleeps under my desk jumping up on my knees every now and then for some attention. 

It just breaks my heart to see him like that. To the point that I thought of giving him up for adoption but I’m afraid whoever takes him won’t be ok with his anxiety. Can someone give me advice? 

Ps: I live in Egypt and I don’t have the luxury of doggie day care :( 

TLDR: my dog is so bored he walks around in circles and I’m depressed and don’t take him out much 

Update: I walked my dog twice today, one 15 minute walk in the morning to do his business (that’s the one walk I mentioned earlier) and another longer walk just now (around 45 minutes) and that seemed to do the trick. I let him sniff around all he wanted and he even got to chase a stray cat and play with her, now he’s happily asleep on the couch. I have also ordered some toys that were suggested in the comments to see if they’ll work. 

I just wanna make it clear that I love the dog and definitely want to keep him. I try as hard as I can to not let my issues affect him and at some point feeding him and caring for him was the only reason I got out of bed. And now that I am doing a little better, I want to make his life a little better too which is why I asked for advice. 

Another concern that people had in the comments is that I don’t let him out to go to the bathroom enough times which is not healthy, I want to clarify that I have a designated bathroom for him in my apartment which he uses throughout the day, and then I clean it at the end of the day. So he’s definitely not holding his pee for extended periods of time. ",1727519690.0

He does play with his toys a lot, but by the end of the day, most of them are all over the house.  I end up collecting them and putting them away.  He is a fairly smart dog, so I am wondering, since he knows how to take the toys OUT and he sees me putting them back IN, would I be able to teach him to put his toys away?",1727482664.0
dogs,My dog is so anxious in our new home ,"I adopted a 7 year old dog who had severe anxiety. She was neglected and abused heavily, but over the past months she has blossomed into a confident and loving dog. She has slight separation anxiety, but nothing terrible.

I’ve moved into a new home today and she is a mess. She took some of her high-enrichment treats, snuggled on the familiar smelling couch, and is making an effort to control herself. However, she’s panting, she’s drooling, she cries her eyes out if I leave the living room (her safe spot right now). She’s scared to death of tile floor and won’t touch it (luckily only the kitchen is tile). She absolutely will not go into another room. 

Please tell me it gets better. I’m so excited to be providing her a larger home and fenced in yard for her to play (in addition to her normal walks), but I’m feeling so guilty and sad about her anxiety issues. She’s totally shut down right now. ",1727476605.0

dogs,Dog beds: BullyBeds or K9Ballistics?,"So as the title states, I am at a crossroads with purchasing a dog bed from either

Option A: BullyBeds

Option B: K9 Ballistics. 

Budget: $400

I would like a dog bed that my dog won’t chew a hole in. For context I have a doberman who had an obstruction at 6 months old. He’s now 3 and I haven’t had any issues since then. I have been very careful with choosing what materials I put around him. He’s nearly stopped chewing all… Except for where he sleeps. I currently have him sleeping on one of those cheap elevated nylon dog beds from Amazon ($39). The problem is the nylon is too rough and it is making him shed excessively due to his hair being caught in between the nylon woven mesh. I would like him to lay on something nice, the dog deserves it. He’s a sweetheart. 

I would like to hear from those who have bought from either brand though :))",1727430571.0

dogs,Is this pup boy or a girl?,"Could you tell me if this puppy is a boy or girl? I always had girl dogs but adult ones. Not sure if this one is a boy or a girl. Also could you tell me what kind of mutt is he/she? Does it look he will grow big? Not that it matters but I would like to know if he'll be good for apartment or only bigger house/yard, I don't want him to suffer inside small space if he/she is big. I am hoping to find this dog a good home so any info is welcome. My dad found him in the middle of nowhere, he was hungry but trusting and playful. Since they are far away we haven't taken him to a vet yet but will in a few days. Until then I will be looking for normal and caring future owners.

dogs,farm dog ,"Hello Everybody.

From reading the title, I am getting a Great Pyrenees / Romanian Carpathian Sherpard mix. I am planning to get 2 and I went to go see them. I was able to bond with two dogs pretty well but since they are 1 years old, I'm a little worried that they won't see me as their owner.

I'm getting them from a breeder (don't yell at me I know adoption is better but this lady was ethical and she is just donating the dogs now because she can't sell dogs anymore due to her health conditions). I drove for \~2 hours to where this lady had I think at least 20 dogs just roaming around her farm.

These dogs have already been familiarised with chicken, goats, horses, cows, etc. I was thinking of getting these dogs because they're for herding animals and such.

I've never had a great pyreenes and I plan to let it live outside on the farm. Could anybody give me some tips/advice on how to raise these dogs and if or if not I should get these dogs because they're already 1 years old which is practically mature.

Any advice would help!!",1727375488.0
dogs,How Much is Nature v Nurture in Dog Traits?,"We currently have 2 aging dogs - a GSD and a GSP. My husband adores our GSP, while I tend to favor our German shepherd. Both were adopted as adults dogs.

When discussing our next dog, which will be purchased from a reputable breeder, we are torn. 

My husband appreciates the affection & athleticism of our GSP. We both run, so we love the endurance, and how he cuddles up with us and our toddlers.

I appreciate the trainability of our shepherd - she waits on commands, while our GSP is more independent / exploratory.

However, our shepherd is protective of our kids, to the point where she will occasionally bark at babysitters in the home if they don't have an assertive personality. Never aggressive with them, but bossy. 

I lean towards getting a shepherd puppy, while my husband would prefer a pointer/Irish Setter/Rhodesian Ridgeback. We don't have Ridgeback or setter experience. 

Will we see a huge difference in shaping a dog's behavior when we purchase a puppy instead of adopting an adult dog? Or does the breed we choose play such a big a difference? ",1727375380.0

dogs,Breed recommendations ,"
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I have fostered dogs since leaving home and have grown up with dogs my whole life. I currently have a rescue chihuahua I adopted as well. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* Reputable breeder due to rescues restricting renters being able to adopt, as well as restrictions on the dogs becoming assistance dogs. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I’m looking into an assistance dog prospect, however that is not a must. If they aren’t suited to work then I won’t force them to work. Ideally a calm and neutral dog when out, but still playful and loving. I don’t mind a good old hike, and would love to have a dog whos just as happy to rot on the sofa for a few hours as they are to do the occasional hike in the Peak District during the summer. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I grew up with German Shepherds and Cane Corsos, so I’m very much looking for a larger more robust dog. I have a few health issues that mean too much intensive exercise will cause me to faint or go into cardiac arrest (not very fun) and occasionally have absent seizures. I haven’t had any tonic clonic seizures in years but I’m not too keen on smaller dogs in case i fall on them or trip on them. I love animals in general and I like qualities as opposed to breed. I love dogs who are very owner oriented, but can be tolerant of others. I don’t need a social butterfly of a dog, they don’t have to love everything and everyone they meet. 


5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Scent detection, dpt, psychiatric SD work, crowd control and targeted barking. Agility and advanced obedience (IGP or similar) can also be a good way of blowing off steam. If the dog starts showing interest/skill in an area, i will do my best to accommodate that. If they love playing tug and releasing the toy when told? Bite work could be introduced. They like parkouring off furniture? Agility. I’m happy with training the dog in front of me as long as they’re happy and fulfilled. I’m close to a trainer who specialises in service dog training and can do public access tests with her. 

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I don’t have any experience personally, but I have tagged along and would absolutely love to train as if we were competing, but not enter any competitions if you get my point. In terms of working, ideally an assistance dog for cardiac alert/ptsd. I have been through some national organisations however they didn’t have any available services. I’m also unfortunate enough to need a multi-purpose SD. They don’t want the dogs learning to do dpt as a cardiac alert dog apparently 🙄

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Im disabled and work from home, so being completely realistic around 10 or so hours as I do have to concentrate on my art without the distraction, and to sleep/make food and eat.

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* We don’t have dog parks as such in the UK but I live in the countryside on a tiny road. Closest shop is a 45 minute walk away one way, so 60 minutes of walking a day minimum as the closest village is 30 minutes away. There are no livestock fields so off lead walks with me and another few dogs realistically. If I move the area I would be moving to is similar, Northants for the UK peeps. As long as I can take regular breaks to sit down I’ll be fine. I won’t be able to go running/cycling with them but a long walk is completely fine. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I currently do my mums dogs grooming, as well as my rescue chihuahuas. I don’t mind going to a professional grooming salon either, if required. I don’t mind doing a trim, ear clean or nail clip and have grooming equipment. 

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Ideally large to giant (20kg+) I can lift 45kgs comfortably (mastiff foster was scared of stairs so spent a few months carrying him up the stairs) 

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Slobber and shedding: clothes can be washed and raked. 
Barking: as long as its not husky levels I personally dont mind. For my neighbours I would say nothing unreasonable, normal amount if not a bit more. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important as most dogs in the UK are off lead on walks. As long as you aren’t on a road you can have your dog off lead (if they aren’t an XL bully) 

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I would prefer a snuggly dog but they all need some quiet time alone. Mostly because I would need an owner oriented dog for SD work. 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Same as above, however they may have to make their own decisions when working, such as when my heart goes funky, they’ll need to learn to alert at different levels and intervals without prompting. 

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Im not HOH or deaf but my hearing is atrocious. I would absolutely be fine with a few barks. Nonstop barking and jumping is an absolute no, but a couple deep boofs is a ok. With strangers, neutral/unbothered or tolerant. I don’t really want someone to come up to me and try and pet my dog, or talk to me, but if they do i need them to just sit/stand/lie there and ignore the other people. 

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Maybe. My fosters/current dog have mostly been dog aggressive and I worked with the rescue and trainers, however I can’t have an SD who is aggressive, and would have to wash them. 

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression, simply because I have a dog currently, and due to the requirements for ADs/SDs. 

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 2-4 hours max a day for cooking/the weekly shop. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My housemates don’t care as long as nothing is damaged ie carpets and skirting boards. No involvement other than a few pets here and there. As long as they aren’t a JRT or another small breed. Monty is enough apparently. 

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Currently have an 8 month old male chihuahua, my housemate has a 5 year old bulldog called Henry. 


21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not too regularly but often enough to be something to work on in training 

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Yes however in the UK there are laws preventing bias towards dog breeds, my current landlord doesn’t care and I have written permission, and as long as you don’t have more than 2 dogs in Council housing you’re allowed any breed. 

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I like in the UK so Pitties and XL bullies are banned (unfortunately, I do love bully breeds) 

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* For summer its typically 15-26 degrees celsius and winter is normally 5-15. It really depends our weather is all over the place. 

25)	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I have helped my friend train her current assistance dog, and am doing a course on canine behaviour and training. I’m open to any breeds that can potentially be trained as an assistance/service dog as the vast majority in the UK are owner trained, as psychiatric SDs for adults aren’t catered for

dogs,My roommates dogs are scared of me and becoming aggressive. ,"My roommate moved in a year ago with his 2 dogs. 
One dog is startled easily. 
I am a very loud person with everything I do. 
It took them a few months to get use to me but then everything was fine. They would come to me with no issues. I would bath them. Brush them. Feed them etc. 
The one who is startled easily started shying away from me when the owner wasn’t home and wouldn’t come inside with me. Then the other one followed. Now they won’t come anywhere near me or even come inside when I’m home without my roommate. 
When I feed them they won’t eat until I’m back inside. 
They stare at me and watch me all the time. Lately they have started becoming aggressive towards me when he is not home. 
When my roommate is home they will come near me sometimes. 
I’ve tried giving them treats but they won’t take anything from me or come near me. 
I am feeling uncomfortable around them when he is not home. 
I’ve also been away a lot lately for a few weeks at a time and then back for a few weeks. Not sure if this has made a difference or not.

dogs,[Breeds] Thinking of adopting a dog,"**Introduction**

    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * Yes, this will be my first dog.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * I am looking to rescue a dog, and I would rather adopt an adult dog over a puppy.
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * My ideal dog would be an 8-15kg, medium energy dog that is cuddly, friendly, fairly receptive to training and eager to go on walks and adventures but can be entertained inside the house as well, for days that it's just too hot to go outside. I don't mind being alerted or shedding but no excessive barking or furnadoes every other day. Basically a good city/apartment dog.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * Kokoni dogs and related mixes are my #1 choice. I've read and seen that they make good companions that are friendly, alert and receptive to training, they are super cute and they're bigger and more robust than most toy breeds. Pomeranians and papillons are two other breeds I like for similar reasons.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Basic obedience and a few fun tricks.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * No.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * About 2-4 hours a day on average, slightly more on the weekends.
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * About 1-2 hours a day I would say. 2-3 walks a day about 30-50min each, with playtime like fetch, tug and mental exercise with puzzle feeders, sniff mats, lick mats, etc. in-between. Dog parks won't be included, I'm not even sure if there are any dog parks near me. 
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * Every few days to once a week is alright with me. Yes, I am open to grooming my dog at home.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Small-to-medium size? I'm worried over how fragile toy breeds are but I don't want a huge dog either. 
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * I am okay with some shedding and barking, slobber is another story.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * Not important, I don't mind always keeping my dog on a leash.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * I would like one that's more on the snuggly side.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * More eager-to-please.
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * Ideally I would prefer a dog that responds calmly and that's friendly with visitors, but since I also live in a big city I wouldn't mind a watchdog either, so long as friends/family can safely come over.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * No.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * I would like to avoid taking a long time to potty train and general reactivity, as I live in a busy neighborhood with people, other animals and cars/bikes coming and going most of the day.
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * I am between jobs at the moment and working on finishing master's degree from home, so I'm at home all day and can devote much more time to the pup. My father's shift typically ends at around 2pm so once I'm back to work, the dog would be left alone for about 5-8 hours a day, 5 days a week. 
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * My father likes dogs and would also prefer a smaller dog, admittedly a little more on the toy dog size of things. However, he agrees we don't want a dog over ~15kg. It was my idea to get a dog so I will be the primary caretaker, and he will occasionally play with or walk the dog when he'd like to or if I can't do it due to illness etc.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * Yes, I currently have 4 pet reptiles. Two corn snakes, 1 ball python and 1 kingsnake. I will never let them interact directly or without super close supervision, as a dog can easily harm and kill them. I might like to have a cat eventually, but it's not a deal breaker if I can't.
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * No. I don't have kids or young siblings, and neither do my friends.
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * Yes, I rent. No restrictions under the contract. Under Greek law I'm pretty sure it's also illegal to evict someone if the contract doesn't explicitly state pet limitations and they have no more than 2-3 cats or dogs in an apartment, as long as their dogs/cats are all kept within their rental property, aren't left in the public or exposed areas of the building (ie. balconies, hallways, garages etc.) and don't disturb the other tenants during common quiet hours.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * Greece. Information on banned breeds is conflicting; I've seen organizations and people say there's no banned breeds, but I've also seen others say that pitbulls, rotweillers, akita and tosa inus are banned. However, I don't think there actually is a law anymore (and if there is it isn't enforced), because while I've seen tourists say they were denied entry into the country for vacation due to their dog years ago, I also see unmistakable pitbulls, rotties and akitas on my walks and in shelters now. 
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * Summers can get to 35-40 Celsius; winters close to zero.
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    * Bit the bullet and made this post to ask for advice, I've been wanting a dog since I was a kid and I've seriously thinking of adopting a dog for about a year now and I'm at a comfortable enough position now where I might be able to do it! I have even scoped out a specific dog in a shelter since the summer, but I'd like opinions if it seems like a good match for me?",1727352423.0
dogs,Bringing a stray puppy from the Philippines.,"Hi there,
 
I’m currently in the Philippines for a month long holiday, and I’m now on the last 2 weeks. 

Recently, at the beach, where I was in a hut for the day, a stray puppy came along with some other stray dogs, looking for food. I noticed how this puppy seemed lost, dishevelled and didn’t seem to have his mother.

As we were about to leave, I told my family that I’m going to take the puppy with us. I’m glad I did, because I don’t think it would have survived much longer.

So, I fed and watered him, kept an eye on him, played with him etc. He’s now flourishing, he’s healthy, and is bonding with me. He’s very energetic, curious and loves to nibble on things (toes included!).

I’m going to be devastated to leave him behind, and would like to seek advice on bringing him home back to the UK. It seems so long winded, and I was wondering if there was any easier way to facilitate all this? Are there any charities that can help? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who gave their advice and input. I will contact the Pet Trans Pro that someone gave on here. If it’s not realistic, I will still have someone who will look after him here on the island :(  My partner back in the UK said he may try and help me.

I understand, that il have to buy him a “ticket” as he wouldn’t be coming with me as I leave on the 8th October. It all costs money, and I’m not rich right now, but I will try my best!",1727352907.0

dogs,Maybe looking for another dog,"1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* Probably rescue

3)Describe your ideal dog.

\*  Companion dog, gets along with other pets, relatively easy to train, friendly (or at least not hostile) with strangers.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* I’ve always thought I wanted a big dog next time around.  I like labs for their personality and adaptability.  Realistically though, I’m not sure if I’m up for the energy levels of a working/sporting breed.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Basic obedience, maybe canine good citizen

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* As much as possible.  I work from home.  I do actually have to be at my desk working for 8 hours a day, but my time/schedule is pretty flexible.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* I have a fenced backyard for running or fetch and could also walk (on leash) up to an hour or so per day.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* Willing to do (or pay a groomer to do) whatever is necessary.  Ideally not daily.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)What size dog are you looking for?

\* Pretty much any size, but not tiny.  I like medium/large dogs, but realistically a smaller dog might be a better fit for my small house and my resident small dog and cat.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* Barking- some is ok but would like a dog who doesn’t bark a ton and/or can be trained to respond to “quiet.”  Shedding and drooling is really not an issue.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Not important

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* Fairly eager to please/trainable

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* A warning bark is ok, but I would like the dog to be friendly with visitors and at least accepting of strangers

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* I can deal with some minor resource guarding (i.e. feeding separately, etc.) but the dog needs to safe with my resident dog and cat.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Aggression toward people would be a no-go.  Would also strongly prefer a dog without major house-training/marking issues.  (I know house training is part of having a dog and all dogs have accidents sometimes- I’m thinking mainly of some of the toy breeds that can be a struggle to fully house train)

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* A few hours, not every day.  I also have family nearby who can stop in and visit when I’m gone.

\* N/A

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* No, I own a house.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* Midwest US, no breed bans in my state or city as far as I know.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summer 80s-90s, winter usually 20s-30s and sometimes colder

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

\* Would prefer to avoid breeds known to have serious health problems.  I have no problem providing vet care, but it’s just hard to see them sick.

I lost my best buddy (cavalier King Charles spaniel) in January and I’m not sure if it’s the right time to get another dog yet.  They say when you know, you know.  At this point I think I would be open to getting another dog if the right one came along, but I’m not in a huge rush to find one ASAP.  Thanks for any and all suggestions!

dogs,Mini Aussie NYC,"Hey all. I'm looking for a Mini Aussie in the NYC or NJ area. 
My boy Oliver, ""Ollie"" for short, crossed the rainbow bridge.
Unfortunately 2 years ago he was struck by a speeding car and perished. He was 4 years old and he was my best friend, ever! It has been 2 years of me mourning him and I still miss him dearly, everyday. I wasn't ever looking to replace him, but every time I see an aussie or a picture of my boy, I get in my feels.  Long story short, I'm ready to add another mini to my growing family. I have a  3 year old daughter and a 1 year old son and I feel this is the perfect time to get them(and me) a loyal companion to grow with them. I know the Aussie breed and have experience but cannot find any up for adoption, and the ones that are for sale are way too expensive. There are some more affordable ones but those are out of state and we do not own a car. Please, any help, advice, referrals would he greatly appreciated. Where did you meet/adopt your aussie? Thanks a million!",1727298467.0
dogs,Is this more normal in Australia?,"I've gone through the Reddit guide and sent the questions to breeders on the breed club website. The ones that have come back always say a variation of the same thing:

1. We don't guarantee for behaviour because that's a training and socialisation thing. We do guarantee for health. Guarantee as in they will take the dog back. 
2. We have puppies available now. Or we don't now but this kennel does, contact them. 
3. You pick the puppy. They seem puzzled why I would explicitly ask for lower drive etc because their pups are apparently all similar and it's how I train/socialise them to mold them. 
4. Some don't elaborate much on the socialisation. Some have said the outcome after the dog comes home is totally on us because training/socialisation. 

Those would be orange/red flags according to the Reddit guide but these are breeders who are well known in the breed and tick all the other boxes. Is the guide more US centric?

These are Labrador breeders, is it a breed thing? I get training and socialisation because of course and I'm an experienced owner but there's also a genetic component to behaviour. ",1727298729.0

dogs,Looking for Recommendations for My Next Dog - Need Advice!,"1) \*\*Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\*\*

2) \*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?\*\*

- I'm open to either, but I prefer a reputable breeder as I want to ensure a healthy dog with a predictable temperament.

3) \*\*Describe your ideal dog.\*\*

- I’m looking for an active, sporty dog that doesn’t bark excessively, is a good watchdog, but also playful and goofy. They should be smart, easy to train, and capable of handling some alone time while I’m at work. Ideally, the dog will have a good balance of energy and cuddle time and be good with other dogs as I may get a second dog in the future.

4) \*\*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\*\*

- I’m interested in medium-to-large breeds that are active but manageable in a city townhouse. I’m considering another Jack Russell Terrier, but I’m also open to breeds that match my lifestyle (active, trainable, and playful).

5) \*\*What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\*\*

- Basic commands (sit, stay, come, etc.), good leash manners, recall for off-leash activities, and possibly agility training. I'd also like them to be comfortable with hiking, camping, and possibly playing sports with me.

6) \*\*Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\*\*

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) \*\*How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\*\*

8) \*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly, and does that include using a dog park?\*\*

- On average, I can devote about 1 hour to two of exercise per day during the workweek. This will include walks, running in the park, and visits to the dog park. On weekends, I’d love to do more strenuous activities like hiking or beach trips.

9) \*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\*

10) \*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\*

- Medium-to-large size, ideally around 20-90 pounds.

11) \*\*How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\*\*

12) \*\*How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\*

- Fairly important. I would like my dog to be well-trained with recall so I can let them off-leash in safe, unfenced areas like parks or trails.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) \*\*Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\*\*

- I prefer a dog that enjoys cuddling but can also be independent when needed.

14) \*\*Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?\*\*

- A balance of both. I’d like a dog that’s eager to please when training but can entertain itself when I’m busy.

15) \*\*How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?\*\*

- I’d like the dog to alert me with a bark if someone is at the door but settle down quickly. I’d prefer a friendly or neutral greeting with visitors, nothing too aggressive or overly excitable.

16) \*\*Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\*\*

- I’d prefer a dog that is good with other dogs, as I may adopt another dog in the future. Aggression would be a challenge I’d rather avoid.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) \*\*How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\*\*

- I work in an office 4 days a week for about 8 hours a day or less. On those days, the dog would need to stay home for that period but should have sufficient exercise before and after work.

- I live alone for now, so all dog care will be my responsibility.

- I don’t have any other pets currently, but I may get another dog (possibly another Jack Russell) in the future.

dogs,Bedtime ,"We and our 4 dogs just moved to a new house, its been over a week, on Wednesday itll be about 2 weeks, we used to live in a caravan so the dogs are not used to a house with rooms etc. Other than when they were in the dog hotel for a good amount of time (we went on holiday then was homeless so we had to find a home before taking them back)
Right now they are adjusting,  to being with us again, in a new house, wirh lots of newness! 

Sleeping wise, we all sleep in the room, our youngest pup shes in a pen and the 3 dogs on a blanket on the floor, in our caravan when it was just the 3 dogs not the pup, they used to sleep on the bed, we didnt want them to at first but we did find comfort in it, but then i saw the issues of it, and now since being back they have wanted to join us on the bed but we have a gate seperating the bed and them...
Many times 2 of them are really good, my smallest dog out of the 3 is a good boy, he doesnt complain at all, especially when we are just going to bed; but after a few hours and even after they go out for a pee if they need in the AM, they sometimes cry to go out of the room to most likely sleep on the couch downstairs, but we dont exactly trust them alone downstairs yet, we can try it out but i jist get concerned incase they try rip up stuff because we arent there even more so if the door to our bedroom is closed. Because sometimes my dog likes to patrol,..
Sometimes they cry in the morning even if they were out not long before and my sleep gets disturbed... im very pregnant so my sleep is already crazy disturbed 🤣🤣

There had been a few nights where we've fallen asleep on the couch, nd the dogs sleep through the night with no complaints, probably because theres nothing stopping them from jumping up on the couch!  Id been able.to sleep thru the night till a good time, I do think the core isssue is that my dogs want to be on the bed and if they arent then theyre more restless. Because i bet if theyre laying on the bed theyll sleep all night lol
Im wondering if comfier dog beds would help them. 

Is this something that will change with time? Or something that needs to be trained out of them? 
Perhaps through not allowing them on the bed, they will chill out. 
What if we also stop them being allowed to come on the couch, would that help them from feeling like they need to be on the bed/couch?

Do these things come from dominating? Or its just because of comfort?",1727141141.0

    26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

My partner and I have been considering getting a dog, but it's so hard to choose. The dog must be knee-high or taller (my partner's condition) and fairly fluffy. Can you advise what do tou think about the below options?

Our first option is a Newfoundland, a breed my partner knows well as his parents had one when he was a teenager. However, I'm worried about the size—it's too big for train rides to visit my parents (and I go about one weekend a month), and it won't fit in their small car. Either my partner will have to stay home with the dog, or I'll need to buy a bigger car, which is daunting since I'm just learning to drive, and don't have a car at all yet.

I'm also concerned about the fur and drool, as we live in an apartment without a garden or space for the dog to swim. The costs for XXL size supplies, food, and vet care could be high, and I'm unsure how we'd handle emergencies (what if the dog get hurt or sick? How to carry it to the vet?). Despite these concerns, I’m still considering it because of its great temperament and how much my partner wants one.

The second breed we're looking at is a Eurasier. But since it's a primitive breed and I'm inexperienced, I worry it might be hard to manage. I'd also prefer a more cuddly, easygoing dog. I like that they are fairly quiet and their look.

Lastly, there's the rough collie, a breed I love. But I’m concerned about the grooming demands and that they tend to bark a lot, which I dislike (also I don't want my neighbours to hate me LOL). Plus, as a herding breed, I'm unsure how much exercise and time they would need daily. Me and my partner are quite couch potatoes and both work 8hrs a day and we don't want the remining hours to be spent on the dog only. Of course the dog will have walks and play everyday no matter the breed!

We mostly seek a companionship at house and to go on walks. We aren't looking for a dog to train agility with etc.

My boy Seymour is a shredder- he will go straight for seams on toys and go through them quickly. The cloth ones are his favorite- and while he has a few rubber balls he will play with he doesn’t like many other toys I’ve found that aren’t plush or softer things.

dogs,House move - anxiety or something else? ,"Moved apartments about a month ago, same condo, different unit. Doggo has been great 9/10, discovering the joys of having a balcony, appetite all good, everything normal. However, I've noticed on most nights she goes to the corner in front of the bathroom to lie down and hang out there. If bathroom door is open, she'll go underneath the counter (that particular spot is where she goes when she's scared during thunderstorms and fireworks, etc.) She doesn't seem particularly anxious since when that happens she'll usually sit up straight and not lie down and is usually shaking, which hasn't been the case.

When she decides to come sleep with me at bedtime, she'll first go to the only available corner in the bedroom and sit. She eventually lies down in that corner. I keep the door open in case she wants to leave and some mornings she's in the living room on her couch corner, or in her bed, or at foot of my bed (her preferred spot when we sleep together) or in her teepee which is in the bedroom.

I can't figure out what's happening, and if this is just normal moving stress / anxiety. This only happens at night. She is a rescue and was found roaming the streets. Unfortunately I don't know her history beyond that. She has been with me for 5 years and our other place was the only place we lived in before moving. We go to grandma's house periodically and she has always been fine there. Don't know her age but probably around 10 or so. We've had a few health scares so we have regular check ups / bloodwork and all is good. I haven't noticed any other cognitive issues that may be age related.

dogs,Breed recommendations small/medium dog Europe,"I’m looking for a suitable family dog for in the future. My husband prefers a smaller dog, but I would prefer a medium sized dog. Although ultimately temperament is the most important so we’re both willing to meet each other in the middle on this! Would prefer going through a breeder as this will be our first dog. We’re considering a Barbet, but my husband would prefer a smaller dog. 

Are there any alternatives that are a bit smaller but have a similar temperament? I looked at the poodle, but possible nervosity is what’s holding me back. 

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes it will be our first dog. We have had a cat for over 6 years. I was around dogs when I was young.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

At the moment going through a reputable breeder. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

My ideal dog would be calm inside. Not nervous. Low shedding and would listen relatively well with training and will stay close outside. Active outside, but we won’t have a high fence in our yard (also not possible). Would be nice to be able to walk off leash in the country side, which is allowed and common where I live. As a family we’re often outside. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Interested in several breeds. My husband would like a smaller breed and I would like a medium.  

Highly considering a Barbet. It’s a bit big for my husband but ultimately the temperament is much more important. Are obviously open to other breeds. 

Other options I’m considering: Medium poodle, Volpino Italiano or German Spitz, Retro pug (regular pugs or French bulldogs are forbidden where I’m from, which is not Italy). Someone in our town has a Volpino Italiano who’s calm and always walks off leash next to her. 

My husband likes: Havanese or Coton de Tulear, as they’re eager to please and can be trained by a first dog owner. I’m less attracted by these breeds though. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Off leash walking and general training. We’re both committed on training the dog and ourselves. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Definitely obedience and might do agility. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I’m mostly home, might work part time in the future. So I will be playing and interacting most of the time with the dog. Husband works fulltime and kids go to school. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Mainly walking, playing and training. Could also do occasional swimming in the sea. There are no dog parks where I live.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I can pay for a professional but will brush regularly. I’m planning on learning how to trim the dog myself but will start with a groomer. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

I would like a medium dog (max 50 cm, 20 inch). My husband would like a smaller dog but is open to a medium dog if they have the right temperament, same for me the other way around.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Preferably low shedding, not allergic though. Low/occasional barking and no slobber. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Very important with training. At the moment we live in an apartment but will likely move outside the center and have a yard. It’s very hilly so big fences are uncommon. Small fences are possible, but not sturdy. We visit family regularly and stay with them, their places don’t usually have fences though. So we need a dog who doesn’t run away when given the opportunity.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A snuggly dog.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

More eager to please 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Be friendly with visitors

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

No excessive barking and not aggressive. Although I know the first one might be reduced by training. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not often, a few hours here and there. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Husband and kids want a small and a dog who’s not active all the time.  Kids are small though so they mainly look at how dogs look lol. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

We have an older cat now. I’m not sure if he will still be here when we get a dog though. The dog will probably meet other cats though. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, a 4 and 6 year old. They’re used to a cat and are cautious. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Yes rent right now, but might buy soon. No breed/weight restrictions. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Italy. No banned dogs.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

dogs,Looking for breed recommendations as a first time owner with 2 cats. 🐱🐶,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
Yes. I do not have any experience owning or training dogs. I have had cats all my life (currently have 2), but have wanted a dog since I was a small child (I'm now 28).


2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?
I love the idea of rescuing, but either is fine. As a first time owner I have concerns about training a dog out of potential bad behaviours previously learned if rescuing, and a pure bred from a breeder I may know what kind of personality to expect better. Maybe both those assumptions are incorrect.


3)	Describe your ideal dog.
A medium to large sized dog that gets along well with cats, and easy for first time owners. I'd love a dog that's mostly content with being lazy around the house or running around our yard. I like to go on some short hikes in the summer (usually 3-10km in length), and I'd love a dog I could bring with me for that too. A general love bug.


4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
King Charles Cavaliers sound perfect from the research I've done, and I keep going back to them. They sound lower energy, good with cats, and easy first time dogs. Open to other breeds for sure though.


5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 
Just the essential commands to be well behaved. Anything extra is a bonus but not priority.


6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 
No.

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
1-2 hours. 

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
No dog parks. We have a large yard, which I'd like to get fully fenced that the dog could run around in, or have a section of the yard fenced and dedicated to the dog. I'd like to take it for 1 walk a day, varying in time dependant on season. Our winters get very cold here, and it's just not feasible to be outside for extended periods all year.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
Yes I'm open to grooming at home, but a dog that requires less grooming would be better.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?
Medium, probably. I love large dogs but don't think they'd fit my life well.

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
Shedding doesn't bother me, slobber is not my favorite but could be handled, frequent barking gets under my skin a bit.

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
Not important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
Snuggly 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
Eager to please.

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 
Friendly or calm. I'm very happy if he/she loves everyone haha.

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
I'd prefer not to.

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
Nothing I can currently think of.

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
I work 4 days of the week, which the dog would be left alone for between 4-8 hours depending on the day. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
My partner loves dogs but doesn't love the work that comes with them. I know he'd be willing to feed and do some basic care, but I know he doesn't want to take it for walks or do any of the more ""active"" care. He has had dogs before whereas I haven't.

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
We have 2 cats.

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
No.

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
No.

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
Saskatoon, SK, Canada. Not aware of any laws banning breeds.

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
Summer can be 15C-35C, winter -10C to -45C. ",1726970174.0

dogs,Should I adopt one big dog or two small dogs?,"I have a small house, with an enclosed garden, opposite a small park and a 5 minute drive from several very large green open spaces. I’m a single parent to a 2 year old and a 12 year old. When my 12 year old was much younger we had a cavalier king charles spaniel, but my youngest has never lived with a dog before. We don’t have any pets at the moment. I work from home most of the time, but generally go into the office for an 8 hour day once a week (occasionally twice in a week). I spend an hour each day walking the school run, and I have time for extra walks on days I work from home.

Earlier this year I decided I finally have the time and energy for a dog, and my oldest really wants a golden retriever. I think they’re lovely dogs, and I’ve been keeping an eye on the local rescues to see if an adult/senior golden comes up for adoption. I’ve never had a large dog before, but I like the idea of big dog cuddles! 

Recently I’ve noticed several bonded pairs of smaller dogs coming up for adoption, and I’m wondering if that would be a better idea? I already have a small dog flap in the back door, which gave my ckcs free access to the garden for toileting while I was out of the house. A golden would be too big to use the flap, and a bigger flap isn’t an option. Also, as happy as my last dog was, he was a very social little guy, and was never happier than when interacting with other dogs. I think he would have loved to have a companion, especially sleeping downstairs overnight, or while I’m out for a few hours. 

Having never had a big dog, or a pair of small dogs before, I’d really appreciate any opinions more experienced dog owners could give me? What would you do in my position? I won’t be going for a puppy/puppies either way - that is way too much work for me with a toddler at home!",1726946340.0
dogs,Advice for brain-stimulating toys for dogs with very small mouths and missing teeth?,"We have the smartest, most athletic, sweetest little mutt, and I'm worried that we aren't mentally stimulating him enough. He's a foster fail and had to get some pretty bad teeth taken out after we adopted him, but I also didn't know how to take care of a dog's teeth and they got worse again for some time. It doesn't help that he also has a small mouth to begin with.

We're dealing with:

* smart dog - takes him about half an hour to learn anything
* small mouth with low tooth density - all we know about him is that he's a chihuahua mix, so little face and mouth
* loves small, rodent-like toys that, in an ideal world, he'd be ripping apart

dogs,Breed Recommendation / First time dog owner,"**Introduction**

Hello guys, so I am thinking about owning a dog and I could really use some advice regarding this topic. I am still overthinking everything, but I am looking forward to your insights! 

Sorry for bad english, I couldn't be bothered with Grammarly or ChatGPT today. It's not my first language.  


**Will this be your first dog?**

Yes. I've never owned a dog before and there as never a dog present in my childhood.

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]?**

I would like to rescue a dog, but preferably a puppy so I can train it properly into adulthood – and I would like to know at least something about its background (breed of parents, so I can expect a size and character). But I am not against buying a dog too.  
  
**Describe your ideal dog**

Medium size dog. Easily trainable, intelligent, cuddly, active – but not too much like border collie, as I don't have the lifestyle for it. Easy companion dog that I could play and cuddle with, and that could fit in my lifestyle.

**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I like golder retrievers, for their temperament. But they might be too big for my apartment. I also like croatian shepherds and australian shepherds for their character, but I think they would be too much for first time dog owner in apartment.

**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Essential commands, but recall and off-leash behaviour is most important for me.

**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

No.

**Care Commitments**

**How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
  
I work from home, pretty flexible and easy stable job, so I could interact with my dog during work in little breaks often. I would prefer to walk it two times a day, before work and after work/in the evening. Also I can take it outside during my break around noon sometimes for a quick walk.

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

I live near two dog parks, so I would go there during our walks on weekdays – active play and stuff. Maybe in home I would give him some mental stimulation toys and such.

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

I would pay a professional quarterly if the dog has difficult coat, but regular hygene I would do weekly.

**Personal Preferences**

**What size dog are you looking for?**

Medium size dog. I really don't want small dog.

**How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Shedding and slobber – I would prefer less.  
Barking – I am personally ok with it, my neighbours also have two loud dogs and I don't mind.

**How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

I would prefer to keep my dog on leash in urban areas, but when I go to nature or outside of city trip, I want the dog to be obedient off leash. It's important for me, for those kind of trips.

**Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Affectionate.

**Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

I guess more of a balanced dog. I would like to train it with professional from the start to work on separation anxiety.

**How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

I am ok if dog gets excited, but I don't need a guard dog. I live in apartment, so I would like it to be ok with strangers and visitors. As I mentioned before, I would work with a professional to ensure I socialise him from early age.

**Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

I mean, no. That's why I would like to work on training with professional as soon as possible. I want to ''mold'' the dog into a sociable and as calm creature as it can be. That's why I am a bit sceptical on adopting adult dog.

**Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Aggression and separation anxiety.

**Lifestyle**

**How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Probably 1-3 hours a day in the late afternoon, if I go to gym or grab a coffee, go to movies etc. Sometimes I would leave him alone for few hours on friday or saturday nights. 

**What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

No other people.

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

Nope.

**Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Not regularly, but I want my dog to be ok with children, especially my nephews that live nearby.

**Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

Nope.

**What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

Croatia. Nope.

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

35 celsius during summer, winters are usually -5 celsius.

**Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

**ESSENTIALS:**  
  
Medium size dog.

Snuggly, family oriented, easily trainable.

Good boy.",1726932553.0
dogs,Help me find matching dog.,"1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Second dog. Not much experience, none I would say even.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Preferably purbread from reputable breeder, I think, but all's good if dog's good for our lifestyle.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

Nice, safe to be around.  
Preferably cuddly, big and fluffy (would be bonus, but I'd first and foremost look at character).

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Well, if I would have ANY bread of dog I could and give them propper care, enough exercise/place to run and so on, I would either have Golden Retriver, Samoyed, Irland Seter, Beagle or Malamute... I would consider Bloodhund or German Shepherd also. Possibly more, but those would be mine first choice(s).  
More than not, unfortunatelly, I just go by look of bread, as I'm not knowedgable how they should behave. If that's make sense and sorry for that.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Tricks, games deffinitly.  
Wish I could train dog to be mine or my husband's medical assistance dog as we both could use one for different reasons.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Well, if I could use dog as mine/my husband's medical assistance if needed, then that would be great. Outside of that - no. No experience.



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Well... IF I'd be still unemployed or work from home, then just as much as dog need. If not - then still as much as dog need, when I'm home...

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

I don't have good stamina and all, so 3-4 about 30-40min rather slow walks daily definitly. Sometimes either longer or something more like dog park or forest hiking, if I have health to do so.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I don't mind brush dog daily or clean their ears/teeth daily\\as needed. I may be able to bathe dog if needed, but that may be difficut for me ('cause of how my bathroom looks like...). However with nails and/or coat trim I would rather go to profesional grommer as needed.



\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Would have big if could, apartment suitable for small-to-medium.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Don't mind any. But I'd prefer they bark on command and teached reasons (so someone knocks to door or my phone ringing, but not just because they are bored and wanted to play).

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It's not necessary per se, but would be nice to have control over dog in said areas even with no leash.



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I wanna dog that's cuddly and friendly, but can and is able to take care of him/herself when home alone or I need to do something for example.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I'll respect dog's boundaries, but a friendly, loyal dog, that's safe to be around it's my preference. Don't mind if he/she wouldn't be clingy all day long, I love cuddles, but I don't want him/her to be aggresive.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Alarming me in person, like come to me and bark/place paw on my leg or something (I'm deaf so I could use some dog's ears and some sort of assistance with noices in apartment like knocking, boiling water and such). Friendly or at least neutral to strangers, but weary of those who's dangerous (like - neighbour come - dog shall be polite and nice, or at least great with wiggle, sniff and off to it's bed to play it goes, but when someone break in alarm me and/or guard... if that makes sense).

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Well... My first dog was agressive (...wel, behaviourist say he was not exacly, but still) to other dogs and was sometimes kinda hard to control/pull back then (was medium-to-bigish sized), so I would rather not go trough that again.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

If it's possible - low-to-no risk of separation anxiety (my first dog had that unfortunatelly and it quicly became spirally worser as I got a job for short period of time).



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Depending of if I got a job and what job do I get. For now - I'm unemployed and seeking, so I'll be 24/7 at home, maybe few hours in some days to do shoping or to doctor apointment. Sometimes I have apoitments with docs in other city, so that's depending... dog could need to be alone for half a day or just go with me and hubby would walk him around when I'm in (if we agree that I go in alone)...

If I got a job - depending of what kind... so can't give definite answers... But I'm looking for typical 9 to 5 office job, preferablly at-home even, so... probably that.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

My husband will care of our dog as much as I, and as best as he can, but is a bit... more careful around dogs and may need bit time to trust it (he had accident including dog... unfortunatelly... - he's not scared, but visibly more weary than he was to unknown dogs).

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

None and no, possibly.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Poland, I dont think any breeds are banned but ""aggresive"" breads may be subject to some regulations.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

From +/- -15 in winter to +/- +35 in summer (lowest to highest, aprox...).



\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

I'm deaf, hubby have rheumatism. We both have cardiological problems. Therefore we may or may not have health to long, adventorous walks everyday, and sometimes may be days that dog only will get one medium-distance walk and rest would be even shorter.

If dog somehow can help me by being my ears or my husband by being his execirse partner (not sure how exacly dog can help someone with rheumatism, so... let's say that)... and signalise both of us when something is off with other's hearthrate/blood pressure, would be more than great.

She sleeps while I'm at work, and when I get home at 3:00, we play fetch in the backyard. She'd go forever if I let her, but after about 10 minutes of hard running, we come back inside while I unwind for a bit.

After she's calmed down, we usually wrestle with her stuffies for a while, and then she stops and stares at me until I give her an afternoon snack. I give her food some time to settle, and then I put my shoes on and take her for a 1.5-2 mile walk.

Afterwards I make dinner, with her supervising very attentively, hoping for a few scraps along the way. When the family is done eating, she gets her after-dinner treats, where she goes through a random list of her tricks to get each of the treats.

Once the kitchen has been cleaned up, she gets something to chew on (usually a bully stick or no-hyde chew) while everyone gets settled in for the night. 

Around 9 or so, she finally wants dinner, so she gets her biggest meal of the day, and then it's snuggle time in bed. She stays there for an hour or so, and then she chooses to retire to her crate for the remainder of the night.

We're thinking of getting our first dog together and have been trying to find a breed that we both like. Thanks in advance :) **

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I grew up with Bernese/Pyrenees mixes, and worked with my parents to train them. My boyfriend grew up with many different dogs but was never involved in training.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We'd prefer a breeder - we're considering kids at some point in the future, and while I fully understand that amazing, gentle, and family-friendly dogs can be rescued, it would give me some peace of mind to know exactly what breed we have and what health requirements they need, which can be hard if adopting a mixed dog.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

* We both would like a dog that is somewhat low-energy, gentle, and easy to train. We'd like a dog that's generally family- and animal-friendly (we have a very chill, older cat). We'd like a dog we can take on hikes and bring camping, but will also cuddle with us on the couch at night.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I've always gravitated to large dogs. I really love Bernese. I grew up with them, and I loved their goofy, cuddly personalities. I'm also interested in Retrievers, Aussies (which I know are high energy so maybe aren't a great fit), and potentially doodle mixes (which I know is a hot topic, my mom's sheepadoodle is just so cute and smart). My boyfriend also likes large dogs, and has been interested in German Shepherds and labs.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The basics, mostly. I'd really love a breed that can be well leash trained, and can be trained not to jump on people. We trained one of our Bernese mixes to throw away beer cans (which was hilarious and awesome), so maybe a few dumb tricks like that too.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Nah. Our goal is a family dog.

**Care Commitments**

 7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work 3 12-hour days per week, and my boyfriend works from home. We have quite a bit of time to commit to training, socializing, and interacting with our dog. But we would like a dog that's easy-ish to train and isn't too stubborn.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

* At least an hour per day, if not more on days I'm off. We have a decent backyard that we could play fetch in. We go on walks around our neighborhood pretty often, and hike a few times a month. Neither of us are runners or bikers, so we wouldn't be going on super fast-paced walks. We have dog parks in our area that we could go to for socialization. My mom and sister each have a dog (sheepadoodle and heeler) that our dog would probably see frequently. That being said, we don't want a super high energy dog - my sister's blue heeler is a little too much for us.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We’re totally okay with brushing often. Growing up with Bernese, I got used to the hair and grooming responsibilities. My boyfriend seems more into shorter haired dogs, but I really love how soft the longer haired dogs are. We have a robot vacuum that does a lot of work around our house, and we don't have much carpet so fur is easy to clean. I don't mind trimming nails or cleaning ears, it doesn't gross me out. If we have a breed that needs to see a groomer regularly, we could definitely make that work.

**Personal Preferences**

10)What size dog are you looking for?

* We both like larger dogs, at least 50lbs, but bigger is fine.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* We don't mind shedding much. I know that shedding comes with most longer-haired breeds, especially since we live in a warmer climate. We both know that Huskies are a little too chatty for us, so maybe moderate barking is okay? It would be perfect if they'd bark a few times if someone came to the door, but didn't continue yapping for a while after the person comes inside/leaves.  And I don't mind a little slobber (thanks to the Bernese), but my boyfriend isn't as chill with slobber as I am.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Decently important. We like to go camping and hiking, so it would be nice if we could bring our dog and they could be a) trusted to not bolt and come back when called and b) not terrorize other people or animals in the area.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* DEFINITELY snuggly :)

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More eager to please, since we're hoping for a family dog that's easy-ish to train.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

* We'd like a dog that barks a few times to alert us that someone is here, but generally is kind and gentle to strangers. We don't need a guard dog, just one that alerts us when some is here, and maybe has a big enough bark to scare off any intruder.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* We would really prefer a dog that is friendly with other animals, especially since we have a cat and will see my families' dogs often. We plan on socializing our dog, and hopefully we can avoid aggression.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Spastic, constant barking for no reason and aggression towards people (especially ones they've met before).

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not often. My boyfriend works from home, and I'm lucky if he leaves the house to run to the store more than a few times a week. We do go out to dinner and have date-days from time to time, but we're both homebodies so our dog wouldn't be alone much. We do travel occasionally (usually weekends away or short trips to see his family), but my mom is happy to watch any dog we get so that her sheepadoodle has someone to play with. On a typical week, the dog would be alone for maybe a couple hours at time once every few days for dinners or doctor's appointments. There is a small chance my boyfriend transitions back into the office, but since I only work 3 days a week, we could arrange our schedules so the dog isn’t alone often. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My boyfriend plans on being pretty involved, but I think I'm more of the dog-person between the two of us.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a very chill, geriatric cat. He's lived with dogs before and as long as our dog isn't constantly chasing him (we know the puppy phase will be a little rough), the cat probably won't care.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not regularly, but children are a maybe in our future, so we'd like a breed that is generally child-friendly and patient.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Nope.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in Socal, so no rules or regulations regarding breeds. We live in a very dog friendly area, so we see dogs at breweries, patio restaurants, the beach... and would love a dog that could join us on those adventures too :)

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* It gets pretty warm in the summer here (usually 90s in the day). Our house has AC, but summertime would likely limit activities to early morning or evening. The rest of the year is very mild (even winter is like 50s during the day, 40s at night).

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I know doodle mixes are a hot topic, and I don't know much about them, so if you have any thoughts (positive or negative), I'd be happy to learn more. My mom LOVES her sheepadoodle, and I have a coworker with a Bernedoodle and he's honestly such a good dog. But I know there are some issues with doodle mixes and the ethics of breeding them, and I'd love to learn more and make an informed and responsible choice. We’d also like to know more about the grooming and the shedding fur vs. non-shedding “hair” if anyone has any thoughts. 

We would love a snuggly, goofy, easy-to-train large dog. We'd like to bring them hiking and camping, to breweries, and to hang out with our families' dogs, so trainable, sociable, and friendly are our priorities. I also just really love cuddly, goofy dogs, so I'd prefer a breed with that type of personality and temperament. My boyfriend keeps emphasizing a low-energy dog (I think my sister’s blue heeler scarred him for life). I would be happy with a low- to mid-energy dog, especially since I’d love a buddy to walk and adventure with on days when my boyfriend is working and I’m not. 

We also know that getting a specific breed doesn't guarantee a personality type or temperament and that a lot can depend on the environment and training, but would love to know y'all's thoughts on breeds that could be a potential match for what we're looking for and our lifestyle.

Thanks so much in advance, I appreciate all the thoughts and opinions :)

dogs,Please help. German shepherd adopt vs breeder ,"My family has had GSDs our entire lives. Our last dog was a GSD/Malinois mix that we rescued and was just an extremely difficult dog. I feel bad saying this but if he was with any other family I believe that 99% would have taken him to the pound or to be euthanized. 

He was the smartest dog we ever had but extremely aggressive since he was only 9 weeks old. We did everything right but I think it was just a temperament issue since he was probably some backyard bred dog + the combo of GSD/Malinois makes for extremely nervy, vigilant, and reactive. 

We’ve also fostered other GSDs, all of which have been amazing dogs but also came with some issues, although not as bad as our dog. 

My parents are looking to get another dog—GSD, obviously but we are honestly all a little traumatized with our last dog even though we love him so much. 

You cannot believe the amount of training, money, and sacrifice on our end to help him have a good life. 

I know that a lot of rescue dogs are the absolute sweetest (I actually just rescued a 12 week old puppy that’s a literal angel) but I cannot deny that genetics play a very big role in temperament. GSDs are especially tricky because they can be prone to “bad” behavior if they’re poorly bred. 

It breaks our hearts because we’ve always rescued and fostered but I am out the house now and it will just be my mom and dad. They are equipped to take care of a high maintenance breed like GSDs but not to the level our old one was. 

 We are just looking for advice and what to do. Money is not a problem. 

I know there are definitely good GSDs out there we can adopt but I think we’re just a little wary after our last dog. Any thoughts/advice? ",1726771616.0
dogs,Managing a puppy whilst working from home,"I hope to one day add another dog to our household, specifically a working line golden retriever puppy from an ethical and responsible breeder. I have found a breeder that I’m really impressed with which ticks all the boxes. 

I recently started a new role where I can now work from home 4 days a week with one day in the office. I’ve loving the hybrid role. 

I guess my question is, for those of you that work from home or hybrid work, how did you manage a puppy and work? How did you avoid separation anxiety? I want to have a healthy balance of meeting the puppy’s needs and not impacting my work. 

Some background. I have a show line golden retriever now who will be 9 in December. My partner also works from home full time. I have experience of raising my current dog from a puppy. She did puppy, bronze, silver and gold Kennel Club Good Citizen Scheme, she’s done agility and I am an accredited agility instructor. My parents live nearby who are happy to help with support and care if needed. 

I won’t get another puppy/dog if it’s not right for my situation. I will only get another if the time is right. 

Part of finding out if the time is right is making a good assessment of how to realistically manage working full time from home and raising a puppy at the same time which I appreciate will bring additional stress, time and commitment. I plan on taking a couple of weeks off work when I first bring the puppy home to help with settling them into a routine and building trust. 

I have researched some local gundog trainers, obedience and foundation agility skills trainers (once pup is old enough for flatwork at 6 months) near me that I hope to take a puppy to.

We had her neutered in August and when the vet brought her out to us after surgery she was in a complete panic once she saw me.  She got a minor surgical infection a week after surgery and when I brought her to the vet he asked me to stand her on her hind legs so he could look at the incision and she peed all over his floor (I had walked her about half an hour prior).

Took her back to the vet today to get stitches removed and to say that she was uncooperative would be an understatement but we got the job done and she peed on herself while on her side having stitches removed.

Besides giving treats for good behavior what else can I do to help ease her anxiety?  It's gonna be about a year before she needs to see the vet again but this is really tough on the dog.

dogs,Might be time to let my best friend go. Hip dysplasia severely impacting his life. ,"I have a border collie mix who is 13 years old who started exhibiting signs of the dreaded hip dysplasia about a year and a half ago. Originally, he just had issues with no longer being able to climb stairs, which was no big deal since I was happy to carry him up if needed. He would still have fun inside the house, or out in the yard. However, it's to the point where he now has trouble standing up, and because of the discomfort, he is starting to have more frequent accidents in the house, not even really moving from where they happen.

He's still full of love, and not really sure what the best thing to do is. I raised him since he was just a few months, and it's really a hard call. Mentally, he is still there, and the way he looks at me and my son and gives us kisses makes the decision to let him go that much harder.

dogs,How do you know if a dog is play biting?,"Hello,

I’ve got a new neighbour as of 2-3 weeks ago and they have a lovely dog. I didn’t grow up with animals and come from a home where everyone is scared of animals, so I had to train myself to let go of that fear. I’m fine with dogs and I have been fine with this dog so far. The owner leaves the dog with me for a few minutes from time to time and I have had no issues so far.

Around 40mins ago, the owner left the dog alone with me and I attempted to play fetch with the dog. The dog didn’t bring the stick back and decided to play with it on her own, so I supervised. I went to pick up my phone and she started jumping up and biting my arm and running around in circles. She jumped up on me and was biting my arm and running around in circles for 3-4 minutes. I remained calm and removed my mouth from her arm several times. After a few minutes, she’d latched onto my sleeve and wouldn’t let go, but the owner came back and she ran off, which is another reason I believe she was playing.

She did puncture my skin through my jacket and top and her eyes did look a bit crazy, but it’s only a few scratches. I just want confirmation that she was playing because I have a 3 year old that plays outside (with supervision, obviously) and the owner said that he is trying to train her to be more aggressive, which worries me. I’ve never owned a dog and I’m not the most familiar with dogs body language. I acknowledge that it’s my fault for not learning. 

She’s a good girl and I don’t blame her for anything, even if she wasn’t playing. If I’ve done anything wrong or could’ve done anything better, please let me know. She’s 11 months old for the record.

dogs,Questioning my choice - breeder questions ,"**UPDATE: We walked away. Thanks for your insights.**

Looking for some help. I've seen a lot of people get direction here on how they can be sure their puppy is in good health and comes from a safe place.

We are supposed to pick up our puppy later this week from a breeder and I want to see if the community has concerns about our situation. I'm not able to add a screenshot of my conversation so I'll summarize my concerns:

1. the breeder says the parents are registered (I didn't ask specifically where) but they are unsure whether there are limitations on registering the puppies. The parents were apparently papered before the breeder got them.
2. I asked if I could get the parents registration information so I can look it up and the breeder then said they're not letting the puppies get registered, they're pets only.
3. I said I'm mostly just interested in pedigree for the sake of the parents health and whether there are spay/neuter requirements. The breeder said there are no requirements and they offer a health guarantee on the puppies... and they didn't say anything else about the parents.

Currently waiting on a copy of the health contract as well as veterinary records.

Can someone help me navigate this conversation and help me know what other questions I should ask while doing my due diligence? Yes there are yellow flags here, but what are the red flags? What information should I be concerned or hesitant with once I get the records?

dogs,Should I bring my rescue dog to training the second day after adopting?,"I'm a first time dog owner and I am adopting a dog in the next few days. She is 2 years old and has a lot of energy.

So not to make this too long - I am fostering a staffy/pit mix. She came completely untrained, no leash training. Not used to the city. She is 4,5.

She is smart and not aggressive at all. We managed to leash train her somewhat and the city isn't too scary anymore. But - she is super reactive to other dogs - she will not approach them without bolting and jumping on them, and she jumps on people too. We tried to work with that, but...I don't know if I can,.  


The other day she bolted so strongly my hand got twisted in the leash and I pulled tendons in two of my fingers, resulting in worse function, which is not good since she is so strong.

The biggest issue is that she is way too strong and has too much energy. I know I am not strong enough to handle her if something were to happen. 

I am very guilty and frustrated, but I think I will not keep her, which was the original plan. I just don't think I can. Its creating issues in my relationship.

Now my SOs mom is givng her pug up and I really love that dog, so I suggested getting her. But the truth is, we cannot have two dogs.

Instead of printing off some photos or getting a keyring made or one of those gifts to remember her, I thought I would create a scrapbook. The difference being that it is full of drawings of her 🙂. I hope it will still be a great memory but with a twist! 

It doesn’t matter what kind of drawing it is, could be a stick figure dog drawn on a post it! I’m aiming for as many different levels of ability and ideas as possible! 

If anyone is willing to input to help remember my sister’s best friend, I would really appreciate it 😊 some photos below for reference. 

Thank you 🙏

dogs,How do I entertain my dog when she doesn’t like chewing or toys?,"So I’ve had my dog (9 year old rat terrier mix) for years, but she recently moved in with me instead of staying at my parents’ house. I’m not sure if it’s due to trauma she has since she was rescued from a hoarding situation, or if it’s simply just the way she is, (nothing wrong with that, I love her so much 🤭) but she doesn’t chew on anything, ever. If I buy her a toy and try to play with it with her, she looks at me like I’m crazy lol. She doesn’t even pick it up with her mouth, she just fully ignores it. She doesn’t like chewing on bones either. I have classes so sometimes I’m out of the apartment for an hour or two, and I want her to be happy and entertained. Are there any other ways I can try to enrich and entertain her that don’t involve toys or chewing?",1726740885.0
dogs,Please help us find a suitable dog breed,"**Introduction**

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* First dog. We've looked after a cavoodle for two weeks, and a lab for 8 weeks plus other weekends (both dog sitting for friends).   
  
2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* We could do either. Local shelters/orgs in New Zealand rarely rehome if you say you live in an apartment, dispite all the other factors that contribute to being a good dog owner. We want to avoid back yard breeders so we'd look into a registered breeder.   
  
3)Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* Medium size. Capable of coming jogging in the week, occasional hikes on the weekend. Can come to cafes, events around town, friends' houses, i.e. most places we go. Chilling at home with us in the evenings. Capable of being left alone for a few hours at time/half day.  
  
4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* Mini poodles - active, small, trainable. We like beagles, spaniels, labs, goldens but not sure on the suitability. I like poodle/spaniel crosses but I don't think I can find any that aren't suspect backyard breeders churning out pups with health issues.   
  
5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Our apartment is 85 square meters, with a balcony accessible by doors. We have a shared courtyard downstairs (accessible down one set of stairs) to take the dog for quick toilet trips, green space just across the road.   
  
26) Feel free to ask any questions below.  
  
Is there a way to assess non-registered breeders before buying a puppy? There are a lot of dogs on Trade Me (NZs version of eBay/Craigs List/Marketplace) that would be considered backyard breeders churning out pups for big cash, sometimes multiple litters at a time of different cross breeds. I'm sure some of them do a good job of managing health, genetics, etc but it's hard to know.   
  
Please ask any questions for clarification - cheers.",1726715255.0

I’m not sure how to celebrate it, but I really want to make it special for her. This is my 5th year with her, and I want to make her feel loved and accepted. She usually spends her time outside, and I feel bad because I’m always working so I spend very little time with her. Any ideas? She doesn’t play with toys, but she LOVES meat, chicken, fruits.. etc. Should I just made her a plate of everything ? ",1726706122.0
dogs,[Breeds] Questionnaire: What dog breed should I get?,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No. I grew up with several dogs (2 Malamutes, 1 Husky, 1 Retriever, 1 Shiba) and had a German Shepard mix until 5 years ago.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference, but breeders are expensive these days.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* My favorite dogs I have had were at my side as a companion who I could trust to be alert and wanted to please. They are dogs I could trust not to run off or do something silly even if they were not on a leash. Ideally, it would be alert but not aggressively so. I love cuddly dogs, the more pets and kisses the better. At least as tall as my knee, and preferably not a temperamental breed. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I gravitate to breeds that are larger sized, and like Spitz breeds in general. I really like their look and so far they seem to be great family dogs even with all the extra grooming you need to do.

 Not a fan of the smushed faced dogs or the small breeds.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The normal sit/stay/recall commands. I want to be able to trust it off a leash when at home or in places where it is permitted like dog parks or out on trails. Overall responsiveness to commands is ideal.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No experience and no interest. I want a family dog.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I expect to spend most of my time home from work with my dog. I don't mind training at all, I trained my German Shepard and she was great after a several weeks. As long as they are keen to learn and there is progress the time frame is a non issue, but stubborn breeds are probably less ideal.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I live around the corner from a rather large park, and less than mile from a dog park in the other direction. I plan on doing an hour of walking before work, then a shorter walk after I get back. On my days off we would go to one of those parks for a while so they can get their exercise in.

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Brushing is a nonissue, I am rather used to doing that for my dogs. For the nails and ears and bathes I guess it depends on the dogs temperament while doing them, sometimes getting a professional to do it is the better option.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* 40-125 pounds, +18 inches at the shoulder

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I don't mind shedding, I can vacuum and brush. Slobber is a no go if they are drooling everywhere. I don't mind talkative dogs, it can be really cute or funny. I really don't like when they bark incessantly at people outside or when the doorbell rings or things of that nature. My German Shepard was ideal in this regard, bark once or twice to let me know someone is here, then come find me if I don't get the door.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I am rather hoping I can do this. It would be so nice to be able to sit in my front yard and just hang out with my dog without having to worry about it chasing after a squirrel across the street.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I want a dog who is snuggly but not one who will jump onto people. Cuddles and pets are great.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I am happy as long as they enjoy sitting at my side and getting pets whenever they finish what they were doing.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Do not freak out. I work for Amazon and the amount of dogs I see practically running through windows and doors everyday while barking like mad is disturbing. Like I said before, alert me that someone is here and then stay at my side and alert until I give the all clear. Ideally they accept whoever I allow into our house or whoever I engage with, but for total strangers alertness is good.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* My first Malamute did not like other male dogs, it is doable but only if they remain a solo pet in the house.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Spastic barking when people show up. General aggression to people (growling, biting, etc)

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work 4-5 days a week and am gone for 11-12 hours at a time. They need to be okay in the house until I return.
 **Edit: I am willing to get a dog walker if it is best for the dog. I understand they need to use the bathroom and need stimulus.**

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone, but my neighbors both have dogs. So I don't want to bring a breed in that might not get along with a Golden Retriever. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Nope and Nope

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Nope

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent, and no breed restrictions. But I don't think my landlord/neighbor would like it if I brought home a breed known to be problematic. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Urbana, IL, there are limits to how you keep your dogs outside (how many per shelter, leashing them outside in certain conditions) but I don't think there are breed bans. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* mid-80s in summer, 30s in winter

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I live in a 700 sq foot house and I have a small fenced backyard, but the neighbors own the fences and they are less than 3 feet high so leaving the dog outside all day while at work is not an option unless I hook them up to a line/leash. 

 I am worried about getting a puppy since I am gone for half the day 4 days a week. 

 Honestly the reason I am filling this out is because I am worried that the dogs I like would be miserable locked in my house for half the day all alone. I am just trying to do right by the dog and doing my due diligence.

dogs,"New start, new dog? ","I am in my last year of college before I move to a new city. I currently live with my father who is 100% on board with me getting a dog, and I live near rivers, forests, beaches, you name it. The problem is, I am moving to a bigger city that I will not be able to drive in, and I will not be living with my father. I will instead be living with my boyfriend, his mother, and his brother, who all know how to take care of dogs and would be happy to take care of it if something happened in my life

    **Introduction**

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    * Not my first dog. I've had many dogs over the years. I've grown up with them, been taught over and over again how to deal with aggressive dogs, how to train them, even had a few run-ins with aggressive dogs and have been able to test different methods on how to de-escalate a situation.

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    * I'd preferably rescue a dog from a shelter, but I also want a younger dog to be able to give an impression on it young.

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

    * A smart dog who I can raise to be strong, capable, affectionate, and who will come with me on all of my outdoor adventures 

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    * I'm going to be honest. I love border collies and Australian shepherds, but I do understand the hard work and effort that you need to put into raising a dog like that. That's part of why I love them, but I don't think I live in the right type of area for those

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    * All of the basics, but I'd also love to train my dog to do some sort of sport or activity that can be mentally stimulating for it and grow our bond and trust deeper

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

    * I would love to compete with my dog in a sport! I have no experience in it though.

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * I would devote all of my time to my dog if I could. I will be at home most of the day this year, and then I will be job searching for a few months after I move away, so I will still be able to be home most of the time while the dog is still very young.  

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * As long as I'm not in class or doing schoolwork, I can be with my dog. I'm already a very restless person as it is so it would be refreshing to have a companion to go on hikes and down to the river or beach with. I'd most likely go for a short 30 minute walk in the morning, and then once I get home if I have school, I can spend a few more hours(2-3?) walking, running, ect on a busy day. Then if I have a day off, I can spend the whole day on the beach, in the forest, or at the river

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    * I would brush my dog multiple times a day if needed. I am open to trimming, cleaning ears, and all of that. It's just a natural part of owning a dog

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

    * Medium to large size. I don't like small dogs

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * Any amount of shedding is fine for me as I am not allergic, barking would need to be minimal since I do have neighbors, and I hate dog slobber.

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    * As much as I'd love to, I don't think I'd be able to let my dog off-leash much outside of my home

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    * I like affectionate dogs, but not particularly snuggly

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    * Eager to please
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    * I want to train my dog to be okay with noises and stimuli all around it. I want my dog to be able to rely on me for the OK

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * Yes.

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    * I cannot deal with dogs that are stubborn and loud like huskies. I cannot sit and fight with a husky because it wants to take a right turn and I want to take a left. As cute as it is, I'd go crazy

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * My father never really leaves the house anymore (physically disabled), and my boyfriend, his mom, and his brother are all probably going to be working different shifts from me. I doubt the dog will be left alone much or for very long periods of time

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    * My family cannot deal with loud dogs. Especially in the city, loud dogs are a no.

    * My boyfriend has a senior dog who is about to pass away. She is a mini pincher mix

    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

    * No. We do not have, and do not plan to have any children 

    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

    * We are in an apartment now. We will be in an apartment when I move to the big city too. I don't believe there are any restrictions on breed or weight, just the deposit that I have to pay

dogs,Help Finding an Adventure Dog,"You know those Instagram posts where they show the first dog, play “I’m just Ken,” then show the second dog they got thinking it would be as amazing as the first dog, and then play “I’m Just Pete” from SNL while the second destroys all the furniture? I’m trying to avoid that, but I’m not sure how. I feel like I won the dog lottery with mine. She’s a mix of APBT, Australian Cattle Dog, Border Collie, Collie, German Shepherd, Pointer, and a few others. She’s one of the smartest, kindest, most loyal dogs I’ve ever known.

It’s an understatement to say she’s smart. She knows probably 50 commands that I hardly even tried to teach her. She just figured them out somehow. One or two repetitions is all it takes. I’m aware I can’t ever replace her, and it tears me up thinking that she’s entering her golden years. Despite all the gray hair and daily Rimadyl, she still keeps up on 10+ mile cross country hikes with me in the Utah desert and is happy to hunt mice around camp after we get back.

She’s about 50lbs, hardly food motivated at all (I can leave bacon on the coffee table, run errands, come back, and it’s still there), eager to please, and most of all, she’s always trying to interact with me. She cares. I’d love to get her a buddy, and I’d especially love it if she helped train a second dog, because it comes very naturally for her to instruct other dogs. She’s a little bossy, but in a good way. When she sees another dog not understand a command, she tries to teach them.

Are there any breeds I should look for?

**Template Provided By This Sub:**

Rescue

1. Describe your ideal dog.

Hiking/camping/adventure buddy who lounges in the backyard when I’m working from home and won’t chase the chickens. Rough and tumble kind of dog, not a snowflake. Loyal, smart, motivated, active, eager to please. Smart is a must.

Eager to please

dogs,Dog alone while at work ,"Hey everyone here! I’m new and looking for advice/help. My husband started a new job in a different place so it means he’s gone from Monday morning until Wednesday evening. I go to school full time and leave the apartment around 6:45 am. 

Before, my husband used to work afternoons 12:30 - 8 pm and was with our dog during the day and I’d arrive around 3:45 pm and sometimes earlier. He was alone for short periods of time and was used to have someone there in the morning. 

My husband started his new job three weeks ago. I go out with our dog for half an hour before I leave for school to make sure he 💩 and pees. A good friend from us comes around 11:30/12 and walks him for another half hour. I come normally at 3:30 pm and go with him for a longer walk in the forest. Around 1 hour or longer to make up for the short walks during the day.

What I want is basically advice on toys/stuff that I can give him to do so that he’s not so bored the entire time he’s alone. I can see him through the camera and it makes me sad to see him lying down by the door. I think he’s really bored. He doesn’t get destructive but he has started to bark. 

Do you know of any toys that are safe for dogs to play alone with? I’ve seen some Kongs you can stuff with treats or other things but I’ve also seen dogs getting their tongue stuck in there. That’s a fear of mine. That he gets into trouble with the toy and no one is there to help him. 

Please don’t come for me. I’m doing my best under the circumstances. When I can o also bring him to school but that’s not always possible. Normally only when I have workshops where dogs are allowed. Which doesn’t happen all the time. 

Thank you! ",1726644436.0

She's young and healthy and almost definitely going to be just fine, and she's with people she loves and trusts. But I hate the thought of her waking up from surgery without me there.

dogs,Advice! (Not medical),"My dog is a 7.5 y/o Great Pyrenees/Lab Mix, so he is big and fluffy. I am graduating college this semester and I want to bring him to tailgates. He is an honorary brother at one and he loves spending time with them. The problem is people like to touch him randomly and he gets tired. My plan has been to buy a utility cart with an overhang and buying fans that attach to the side. My issue, how do I get him used to it, and feel relaxed enough to lay in it when making longer distances? I am putting his blanket and some toys in it to make it more fun and have his scent in it for him. Is it just going to take time and rounds of training? He loves car rides and sits well and peaceful for long drives. Sorry for rambling, any training advice helps. 

Edit: my dog LOVES being in large areas and meeting people. He has been to tailgates, festivals, and large community events with no issues. The house we tailgate at is smaller in population and has a large yard for him as well. We have been going here for five years. He just gets tired quickly and I don’t like the idea of people randomly touching him. I’m hoping the cart will help keep him active as he ages. ",1726593887.0

dogs,Couple with no kids looking for small/medium dog,"Introduction

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

No, I've owned dogs before.

As a kid our family dogs were all rescues and all labrador crosses of some type. As an adult, I used to have a rescue greyhound. He was already seven and relatively well-trained (housebroken, walked well on lead - his only real training issue was separation anxiety, which I worked with him on) when I got him though, so I've never experienced training a young dog myself.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

I can see pros and cons for both. For a breeder I like the idea of being able to train the dog myself as a ""blank slate"" and being able to see the parents and see their temperaments. The cons are that I don't have much experience training a dog and none training puppies. For a rescue I like that they generally already have some experience of being a pet. The cons are that rescue shelters in my country generally have pretty intense requirements (like a huge garden, not living anywhere near a main road, etc) that I can't meet, and rescue dogs sometimes have trauma that I might not be able to handle.

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

I would like a relatively small or medium dog that is friendly, easy to train/biddable and doesn't have very high maintenance exercise needs.

My partner and I have considered/are currently considering a whippet, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (though their health issues do concern me a lot), or potentially another greyhound. We've also considered a Bichon Frise or a Maltese but neither of us are really a fan of that super fuzzy look.

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

The basics would be walking well on a leash, going potty, sit, stay, and good recall. Outside of that, if it was relatively easy to train I might teach it a few tricks.

**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

No and no.

**Care Commitments**

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

I would like to enrol the dog in obedience classes and possibly also doggy daycare to make sure it gets socialisation with other dogs. I have spare time to play with it each day, particularly at lunch (for about half an hour) and after work.

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

I work from home, so I can be with the dog all day. I would ideally like to take it for a short five to ten minute walk each morning before work and then a longer hour to hour-and-a-half walk in the evening after work.

There's a small enclosed dog park near me that I can take the dog to for off-leash stuff, as well as larger parks where it would need to remain on a leash.

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

I'd prefer a dog without a double coat, as growing up we had a labrador/GSD mix and while she was an angel, I still remember the shedding with horror. But I can groom the dog for a short time each day (or for a longer period on a weekly basis), and am happy to trim hair, clean ears, and so on. I am also happy to pay a professional for regular grooming.

**Personal Preferences**

**10) What size dog are you looking for?**

Small to medium. I don't like super duper small toy breeds, as I feel nervous about hurting them.

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

A little of all of those is OK. I'd prefer to not have an extremely noisy dog or a dog that sheds a lot (think GSD levels).

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

It's not massively important to me, but it would be a nice bonus.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

I'd like a snuggly, affectionate dog.

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

I'd prefer a dog that's eager to please. I've dealt with stubborn dogs before and it's not something I'm very good at navigating.

**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

I would prefer a dog that leans more towards the friendly side of things.

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

I would prefer not to deal with that. Some of my family members have dogs too so it would be nice if they got along on the occasions that they meet.

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

I'd prefer to avoid a dog with extremely high energy levels and stimulation needs, like a collie.

**Lifestyle**

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Maybe half an hour each day when I go out to buy food. Though having said that, my partner lives with me so one of us can always stay with the dog if needed. Sometimes on weekends we might want to leave the house for an hour or two to see a movie or go out to eat. Otherwise, there'll pretty much always be someone at home, most likely me.

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

I live with my partner, who has never owned a dog before (even as a kid). His preferences are pretty much identical to mine. He'll be taking care of the dog equally - we'll be walking it together, grooming together, etc.

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

We might want a cat in the future but there are no solid plans for that and it's not a must-have. For example, if we were to get a whippet or a greyhound I would probably just scratch a cat off the to-get list for my own peace of mind. We have no current pets.

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

No, my partner and I are not having kids and there are no children in the family the dog would regularly see or interact with.

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

No, I'm a homeowner.

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

I'm in a city in the UK.

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

Typical summers here are around 21 to 28°C (69 to 82°F) and typical winters are 2 to 8°C (35 to 44°F), though they can drop to below freezing on occasion.

**Additional Information and Questions**

**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

My home has a small garden but the emphasis should be on small: it's not really a great space for a dog, even a small one, to really run around in. The majority of exercise would take place either at the dog park nearby or on walks.

dogs,Prednisone - Urination,"Prednisone - Urination

I feel like I’m going crazy handling the side effects of my girl being on prednisone. She’s very well house trained but with the volume of water she is drinking she can’t get through the night without several accidents right in front of the door to go outside. I wake up every 2 hours to take her out but it’s still not enough. Our washer just broke on top of this so I’m running out of clean up options as we’ve been drying with a towel then mopping. I’m also unable to leave the house for more than a few hours during the day time or else she has an accident. I show horses and I don’t know what I’ll do this season when I have to be gone over night for shows as my bf works long hours where he can’t visit home and all of my friends who could help will be at the shows with me. I love my girl so so much and would literally stop the world for her but I’m going crazy and have lost so much needed sleep. 

Here’s our setup:

We have 3 cats and our 1 dog.

My ideas have been

1. Pee Pads on the floor where she’s been going right in front of the door.

Cons: I don’t want her to start thinking soft surfaces are ok to pee on as she has only been being on the hard floors so far and I rent so don’t want to risk a caret accident. I also don’t have faith in the pee pads to hold enough liquid for me to be able to sleep through the night.

2. Dog diapers over night.

Cons: Like the pee pads I’m not confident they would hold enough volume. I also don’t want to risk this being the case then her laying and walking around the house and then having pee everywhere rather than just the one spot.

3. Lock the cats in the garage (where their litter boxes, a cat tree, couch, and food/water are) overnight then leave the back door open for the dog to come and go to the yard.

Cons: I feel bad locking the cats out here as it’s nowhere near as comfy as the rest of the house. I also enjoy their presence throughout the house and don’t want to risk them starting to spend most of their time in the garage.

4. Out here in the upstairs office with a balcony and leave the door open for her to go out on the balcony to use pee pads.

Cons: she’s never pottied on the balcony and I don’t want her to learn that’s an okay spot to potty.

I really need advice and any thoughts are appreciated. She will be on Prednisone for months longer as she is very ill and we are currently on weekly vet visits. Should I ask my vet for advice?",1726490095.0

3. Do you have other pets, or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 
   * *I currently have two cats and two senior dogs. But, bless their poor hearts, the dogs will likely be gone by the time I feel totally confident in getting a new one.*

dogs,[Breeds] Non Shedding Medium Size Psychiatric Service Dog recommendation,"**Introduction**

    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * This will be the first dog I’ll be the sole caretaker of. I have two family dogs at my parents’ home, both female Portuguese Water Dogs. I took care of their hygiene and grooming, enrichment activities, and half of their daily walks (30 minutes to an hour per walk).
    
    I started an associate’s degree to become a vet tech. I took a canine behavior class, so I know the basics well and am eager to learn more. In the future, I’ll pursue a diploma in Canine Behavior and Training.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * No preference, although given my situation, going through an ethical breeder will be the easiest. 
    
    My dog will co-exist with my partner’s small Boston x French Bulldog, a cat, and an 8-year-old child (with us every other week).
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    * A buddy. A pupper that will try to bring me a smile on my saddest days. Being able to share a connection, feeling in sync or sharing a spark with it. Being able to communicate without words. Emotional, inquisitive, human-like eyes. I picture it being emotionally intuitive to its owner’s emotions. Able to vibe whether we are on a hike or watching TV. Handler-focused. Casually unbothered to friendly with other humans. Biddable, versatile, and eager to please. Not pig-headed. Quick to recover after being spooked (not very wary). Humorous, clownish, merry, happy-go-lucky. A dog always happy to tag along.Bouncy/light on its feet
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    *Non-shedding breeds, curly dogs.
    
    The sensation of running my fingers through a dog’s curls is unmatched. It’s a good coping mechanism for me.
    
    I’ve mainly been interested in water dogs, such as Barbet, Lagotto Romagnolo, Portuguese Water Dog, Spanish Water Dog, and Poodles.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Deep pressure therapy, anxiety alert, interrupting meltdowns, things to could help with my executive fonctions, talk buttons. Basic training otherwise
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * I want to interact with it as much as I can. At the very least, an hour excluding its walks and sports.
    Training would be done daily, though I’m not sure how long I’d do so each day.
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * The bare minimum would be two daily walks of at least 30 minutes each. I’m expecting more in the range of an hour and a half daily. The first 30 minutes of each walk would be scent-based, and if I want, the last part would be more fitness-focused.

    * I’m good with a weekly brushing session, up to every other day. Ear cleaning and nail clipping would be done at home. Professionally groomed four times a year.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Medium sized. At least 20 lbs to 60 lbs at most. Ideally between 25 to 40 ± 5 lbs.
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * No shedding. I’m good with every human/poodle-like coat. I have no issues with my Portuguese Water Dogs. Huskies, Labs, and other shedding dogs can trigger uncomfortable allergies.
    
    Low to medium barking. It’s not a problem if it’s short and brief. If they go on a barking spree for longer than a minute or two frequently, it’s too much. They can be vocal (‘‘talk,’’ grumble, express themselves).
    
    Little to no slobber.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * 7/10. I want to move to a forest and be able to explore the woods with my dogs, play in water, let them loose, and know they won’t ditch me.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Snuggly, but it doesn’t need to be a 10/10 velcro dog.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * Eager to please
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * Can acknowledge people, get up to check what’s going on, then get back to its business. A warning bark is not an issue. I don’t want incessant barking until the person leaves.
    
    Can come and greet people, be happy, and ask for a little petting. If too happy, learning to have something in their mouth to greet people. I don’t want a bunch of barking or jumping on everyone.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * No
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * Any reactivity
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * I work 37.5 hours a week, commute included. Depending on whether it becomes a service dog or not, the amount of time it would spend alone each day could change wildly. At the moment, I leave at 6 AM and come back before 2 PM. I’d walk it before leaving and spend my afternoons and nights with it. It would go to my parents’ or a friend’s for one weekend per month between May and September.
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * They like dogs. They may occasionally help with feeding and taking them out to potty. It will be my dog first and foremost, then a family dog.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * My partner has a French Bulldog x Boston Terrier, who would be around 4 years old by the time I can get my pup. He also has a cat. Both of them are spayed and neutered.
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * Yes, every other week with an 8-year-old child.
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
     
    * Currently renting. Will buy a condo in the city or a house in an agricultural or forest area ASAP.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * Montréal and Québec City, Province of Quebec, Canada. Both cities allow a maximum of 4 cats and/or dogs. Up to 3 dogs per household. You could have 4 cats, 1 dog, 3 cats, 3 dogs, 1 cat, etc.
    
    Dogs over 40 lbs need to wear a harness, halti, or gentle lead in public spaces. Expected to always be leashed.
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * Temperature varies wildly between 35°C to -30°C (95°F to -22°F) throughout the year. Humidity is high year-round. Winter is generally between -5°C to -15°C (23°F to -4°F), and summer can be between 25°C to 35°C (77°F to 95°F).

dogs,Is it ok to ask a breeder the price of their puppies when reaching out to them?,"Hi guys, so I’m looking into getting a well bred golden retriever, and this would be the first dog I would be adopting that’s not from a shelter or any other situation.

I know a well bred dog is going to be expensive but would it be acceptable to ask the breeder on the price of their puppies when first contacting them if they don’t have that info available?

I’m the type of person that needs a clear goal when I set aside money for something, and also I would need to price compare to an extent.

Thanks for the advice! ",1726518146.0
dogs,Managers dog dislikes me,"One of my managers has a roughly 1 year old female german shepherd. He got her as a puppy and would bring her to work almost every day where I would play with and pet her a few minutes every time she was there, she never showed any signs of fear or aggression toward me and was really sweet while really young. Probably 5 or 6 months ago now the dog would start barking at me, tensing up and retreating when I was around. A few months ago she got spayed and after she recovered and started coming in again it’s even more fearful/aggressive than before, although sometimes she is completely docile and comes up to me for pets and to play. 

Today after she came up to me I pet her for maybe 15 seconds max then she walked away and I went to leave the office and she fully lunged at me like she was going to bite. It sucks because I absolutely love dogs, i’ve never done anything purposely or accidentally that would hurt or scare her in any way I can think of. I’m actually starting to be afraid of the dog and am going to avoid contact because I think I am going to get bitten eventually if I keep interacting. 

Anyone have any ideas about the reasoning behind why this dog has it out for me when no other dog in my life ever has?",1726512303.0

dogs,Sporn Marrow T-Bone Dog Chew,"The brown parts are supposed to be jerky flavour but not edible from what I understand. The packaging said small peices will pass but to take it away when big parts start falling off. Should I just rip out the jerky flavour parts because I dont want him swallowing those, or just consider the toy done now that hes started ripping peices of the brown parts out. What a weird toy to have those brown parts look edible, jerky flavour and easily removable when they are in fact not for consumption.

dogs,Trying to bond with an avoidant dog,"Hey Reddit, I need your help. My husband and I have been talking about getting a rescue pup for years and we started looking for a dog a couple of months ago. We met a 6-month old puppy a few weeks ago that we fell in love with on Petfinder. She came from a ""rescue"" (essentially a person hoarding 20+ dogs in their rental, who was then evicted) to the rescue she's with now and had been in foster care for 3ish weeks when we met her. Prior to that she had basically never been socialized with humans past the one caretaker, although she does REALLY well with other dogs. She was very fearful of us but had really bonded with her foster dad so we saw some hope for her, and she allowed my husband to pet her before we left.

We had decided not to adopt her but had second thoughts and worked out a foster-to-adopt with the rescue for three weeks. We're two weeks in and she has very quickly bonded with my husband, he is her absolute favorite person, she regularly asks him for affection and to be picked up, but she has really struggled to do any sort of consistent bonding with me. When she's tired in the morning and late evenings she can be so sweet and cuddly, lets me pet her, and will even let me pick her up sometimes but during the day she is completely avoidant and really doesn't want me to even touch her most of the time.

The thing is, I'm the one who really wants a dog and we intended for the dog we end up with to be more my dog than my husband's dog. I know any dog will have a favorite human and it may not be me, but the level to which she avoids me is really discouraging and I just don't know what else I can do to try to win this dog over. My husband really loves her and everyone keeps assuring us that with time she'll come to love me but I just don't know that's true based on how little progress we've made in these two weeks. I guess I'm just looking for advice on more bonding techniques, reassurance that yes she will love me some day, or an honest there's no guarantee and maybe this isn't the right dog for you.

What I really want by the end of this week is to consistently be able to pet her and ideally pick her up as she's not totally trained to go down the stairs by herself - she actually bit me early on in the foster when I had to pick her up which I admit did sour me against her a bit. I think that would give me the assurance I need to be confident in adopting her. I'll include what I've been doing to bond with her in the comments, I really appreciate any responses I get 🙏

UPDATE: The rescue has given us an additional two weeks with her on top of the initial three weeks. She's starting to warm up to me more in the past week which has been so encouraging 😊 We've basically decided to keep her as our/my husband's dog at this point, we're just meeting with a few trainers and behaviorists to get their recommendations for helping her overcome her general fearfulness to make sure we can afford any training or therapy she may need.",1726504904.0
dogs,Tips on buying winter/rain coat for small dog that would fit?,Since winter is coming i need to get my dog a coat or two to protect her fur from snow or rain and keep her semi warmer during walks. Should i try buying 1 size bigger or try to find a coat that is closest to her measurements? All previous coats she had for winter would always be too loose on her neck or chest.,1726503825.0
dogs,My 2 years old golden retriever is very aggressive ,"So i have a golden retriever, he just turned two 2 months back & hes very aggressive to the people he doesn't know. He was fine when he was a little puppy. I had him since he was 50 days old. Lived in an apartment with me, & my flatmates. I took him for walks every few weeks but then i got busy with office & soon i lost that habit. But when he was 6 months old, i took him for a walk & he was really aggressive towards everyone back then. So after that i usually took him in the afternoon or late at night when there was nobody around & it was fine.
My WFH ended soon after so i had to move him to my parents place in a different city. I lived with them after we moved for a few weeks so he too would get comfortable with everybody, which he did.

But.. whenever someone passed by the main gate, be it a vehicle or an animal or a human, he started barking at them madly. Idk how to make him comfortable with all that. Hes been in the car a lot of times & still he looks at the windows & starts barking.

I moved back to my work location soon after & visited every few months. Hes always glad to see me after such long periods.

How do i stop him from barking all the time? I mean its alright when he does that playfully.. when he wants something, but when someone else is around.. he just gets mad & uncontrollable. Any suggestions on how to stop this behaviour? 

I might have been a bad parent for him ig.",1726503595.0

dogs,Any tips on stopping dogs from eating cat poop in our backyard? ,"Okay so this is sort of a rant and a plea for help lol. We have a fairly large backyard and a huge feral cat colony that lives in the neighborhood. We have called the available resources in our county, but we are low on the list and in the meantime we are finding it impossible to keep the cats from using our yard as a litter box. 

Our yard is fenced so they’re literally coming over it or digging under it, and we can’t even find the cat poop fast enough to keep our dogs away. They have a strong leave it command but it does literally nothing when it comes to cat poop. It’s like crack for them. They’re also sneaky and will find it but circle back around when I’m across the yard and can’t get to them fast enough. I feel insane right now bc it’s sooo gross and the only solution we have right now is to not let them run in the backyard but that’s not exactly fair to the pups (we literally got this house so they’d have a yard). 

Any advice? Should I just start a routine dewormer to be safe? They are updated on all vaccines and take simparica trio every month and I know that does some intestinal parasite prevention. ",1726502392.0
dogs,Enrichment options for such specific needs. ,"Hello!

Me and my partner just got our first dog together as a couple. Despite us both growing up with many different dogs this is our first fur baby if you will. We compromised a lot to get the right pup for us settling on a 9yo mix. He’s some sort of shepherd mix  and definitely part corgi. 

Anyway the lil mans favorite activity’s are chewing on treats like bully sticks and beef trachea.  And that’s it no interest in balls, frisbees, plushies,tugs nothin. He’s already a little round and I want to diversify and maybe drop the calories of his chews a little bit. Are there any good alternatives that we can get him to give him the stimulation but help keep his weight down? 
 
He has no interest toys so don’t think kongs will interest him at all. That’s my struggle atm.",1726501287.0
