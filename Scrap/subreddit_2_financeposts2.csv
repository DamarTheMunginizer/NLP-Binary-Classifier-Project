personalfinance,Can you remove advisor on a 529 plan?,"I have a 529 plan for my child. It was set up as a NY Advisor Guided plan by a financial planner a few years ago.

For various reasons I no longer work with that person. I've opted to self manage my other investments, so I don't have an advisor/planner at this time and don't plan to get one in the near term.

My plan is still set up with that advisor as the advisor on record. I'm still paying them off every $ I put in but they do not monitor the investments or provide and support related to the plan?

My question...is there a way to remove them without adding a new advisor? Ideally I'd switch to a direct plan but I can't  find an option to do that or remove without adding someone new. I've called the support line but they always refer me back to my advisor.",1732304481.0

personalfinance,Pay for car cash or let it ride in the market?,"Looking for advice since I've asked around and done some research, but I keep getting different answers. I recently bought a new car with the following:

Total Price: $58k

Down Payment: $20k

Total Loan Amount: $38k at 4.9% for 36 months

Monthly Payment: \~$1100

  
I have $40k sitting in investment accounts made up of mutual funds, index, ETFs, and a few stocks. The original purpose of those funds were to pay for a car cash, but now I'm wondering if leaving those funds to grow for 36+ months will offset the amount of interest I'm paying for a loan. If I did drain that account, my plan would be to take that $1100 per month I would pay to slowly build up that portfolio back over the next 36 months. So my questions is, should I pull cash out of investments to pay for a car cash and slowly rebuild it, or leave it to potentially grow and pay monthly payments and take the interest hit?

  
Quick background: I make enough to where $1100 a month towards car payments or investments will not affect me, plenty in savings and maxing out retirement. This is less of a quality of life question, but more how to get the most out of my money over the next 3 years. Thank you.",1732303809.0
personalfinance,Scammed by a locksmith? ,"I accidentally lost my key walking my dog and couldn’t find it anywhere. I called a locksmith out of desperation and the company said one of their technicians would reach out to me. The man called me and then said he’d need to see the car in person and it would be free of charge for him to get to me. So I agreed that was fine. My dad and boyfriend were both present with me when he showed up and so we asked the technician how much it would be and he said 50. We all looked at each other in shock because we thought that was cheap for two car keys. My boyfriend asked him very clearly “you would be able to do everything for 50?” And he responded with “yes I would be able to do it all for 50.” So obviously we said yes. He then proceeded to do his job and towards the end I asked if I could pay him before he finished. I asked if he took Zelle (transfer him money directly through his phone) and he said yes. So I sent him 50 + a 10 dollar tip. I made him look at my phone screen to check his phone number and the amount was correct, he said yes and even thanked me for the 10 dollar tip. He gave us the keys and we were all off on our own ways. He then calls me back 20 minutes later saying that the price was actually 250 not 50. I was so stunned I didn’t even know what to say and said I would call him back so I can speak to my partner. They didn’t ask me for ID or to sign anything at all so I’m just wondering that if I ignore all this will there be consequences? They also don’t have my credit card. Knowing the full price I would have never taken the service. The company hasn’t called me at all and it’s been about two hours. But the man has texted me since asking for the money.

personalfinance,Which health plan should I choose: PPO or HDHP w/ HSA?,"Hi all,

Longtime lurker on a throwaway. Apologies for yet another PPO vs HDHP question, but I was hoping I could get your thoughts on which of my health insurance options would make the most sense for my situation.

I’m very lucky to have several excellent plans from my employer to choose from, but I was mainly wondering whether it would make sense to switch from my current PPO plan to the HDHP with HSA. I’m single with no dependents, so this is for employee-only coverage. Also, dental is separate, so this would be only for medical and prescription coverage. 

I’m healthy and pretty much just do preventative care + twice yearly visits to the dermatologist. I currently have two Tier 1 drug prescriptions.

I have so far gravitated towards PPOs because I enjoy the predictable and low co-pay costs for specialist visits and other services. Even though my healthcare needs are low right now, it’s comforting to know that, should that change, my out-of-pocket costs would be low. I’m afraid that if I switch to a HDHP, I might refrain from seeking medical care in order to avoid the out-of-pocket costs. I know this is a mental hangup and am willing to work on it if the consensus is that the HDHP would be more financially beneficial in the long run (and just to note, I am financially comfortable so this hangup is mainly psychological).

With all that said, here are the specifics of each plan: 

**PPO**

In-Network Deductible: $100

Out-of-Network Deductible: $600

Maximum OOP: $2,500

Premium: $15.62 biweekly

Preventative care: 100% coverage

Copays: $25 primary / $35 specialty

Outpatient MRI and CT scan: $50 copay

Urgent care (in- and out-of-network): $25 copay

Emergency care (in- and out-of-network): $100 copay, waived if admitted

Outpatient Mental Health: $25 copay

Tier 1 prescriptions: $10 copay

Tier 2 prescriptions: $30 copay

Tier 3 prescriptions: $75 copay

Maximum prescription OOP: $750



**HDHP w/ HSA ($750 annual employer contribution):**

Total in-network and out-of-network deductible: $1,650

Maximum OOP: $3,000

Premium: $31.08 biweekly

Preventative care: 100% coverage

Copays: 90% coverage after deductible

Outpatient MRI and CT scan: 90% coverage after deductible

Urgent care (in- and out-of-network): 90% coverage after deductible

Emergency care (in- and out-of-network): 90% coverage after deductible

Outpatient Mental Health: 90% coverage after deductible

Tier 1 prescriptions: covered in the HSA and at 90% in medical plan after deductible

Tier 2 prescriptions: covered in the HSA and at 90% in medical plan after deductible

Tier 3 prescriptions: covered in the HSA and at 90% in medical plan after deductible

Maximum prescription OOP: No separate out-of-pocket maximum for prescriptions

personalfinance,Rent or Sell our House,"My wife and I are considering renting our house when we move in 3 to 6 months. However, given market dynamics we're not sure if it's actually financially smart or not. Disregarding the 'should we even be landlords' question, I'm trying to get my head around the math of 'should we do this financially or not'. I'd love some sanity checks on how I'm calculating the change in cash and the change in net assets from this decision.

Can I get some review of the attached financial breakdown to see what I might be missing / what needs updating?

A quick summary of the math (starting in row G):

G: Home value is based on Zillow today, growing at 2% per year

H to K: My current run off of the mortgage

L: Annual HOA fees, increased by $10/month per year (monthly goes up by $10/month, on Jan 1st each year)

M: Repairs, assumed to be 2% of the home value (which goes up 2% per year). Historically we're at well less than .5% over the last 5 years, but I know that will go up as the house ages.

N: Quick market survey by a colleague in the rental business, growing at 2% per year.

O: Cummulative Change in Cash

P: Assumed return on Cash at 7% per year (assumption C). Also assumes reinvestment of earnings into the market at 7% / year.

Net Assets: Change in House Value + Change in Mortgage Value + Change in Cash + Market Value

  
What might need tweaking here? What obvious or not obvious assumptions am I missing? Things that I'm thinking about already as I re look at this: Rental Income taxes?, Property Taxes /Insurance (realized that Mortgage isn't including Escrow). Capital gains on the market returns. Rental risk with house not being rented at all times / people not paying. Damage risk above and beyond standard repair costs

Been at my current job for 7 years, I’m good at it but I’m so burnt out and it shows. We have all hands on deck for a project that requires over 50hr work weeks until February. I was recently approached about my numbers and how I’m falling behind. I’ve been burnt out even before this project started. I dont get paid overtime for this because I’m salaried. I’m out of paid time off and sick time. 

I’m ready to leave. I’ve been ready to leave. But I’m always anxious about money. The first time I suddenly quit my job was due to adhd burn out, severe depression, and anxiety. I quit suddenly and signed myself into a mental hospital, accumulated thousands in debt, and found a new job about 4 months later (which just happened to be this one...)

I want to handle quitting better this time. I decided I want to stay until the end of the project around February. I’m not sure how Im going to last but I don’t want to leave my coworkers with the bulk of my work. But by Feb, I’ll have around 25k saved up, which is about 8 months of barebones COL.

The loan amount was for 15k. At that point, I was debt free, no family expenses, no other monthly expenses.

Fast forward to today, I am self employed and recently invested in a property where I've ran into some unexpected expenses that have destabilized my monthly budgets. I have resorted to making the minimum payments on the loan until I can pull the investment through. full disclosure, I view the car as a ""luxury""/entertainment expense bc i have a separate work vehicle, Ive thought about selling it but since the payments are so low I figured if I could refi the auto loan to hopefully reduce the monthly payment and get rid of that awful 11%, I don't need to sell it and can keep it.

A. Open a Roth IRA with a company like Fidelity or Schwab and have my personal funds perpetuating the climate crisis

The problem is if you just buy an index fund put money in the stock market. There's no guarantee of anything actually compounding.

The only way I found was to have a fixed rate CD, the gains are pretty modest. Modest maybe 4% but I can reinvest everything after 7 months so that compounds. And it's also a safe investment. 

What else can be a safe investment like this that has compounded interest that's consistent that I can invest in for 10 to 20 years?",1732296974.0

personalfinance,Was told in another sub I should put our house downpayment in stocks/ REITs. Is that correct?,"We have about $200k in an account collecting about 4.9%. It’s 4.9something. This is separate from our e-fund. Anyway, we live in an expensive area and have been sitting on the money for 2 years. I have no clue if/ when we can ever buy a house because they’re expensive here + rates make a mortgage payment on a SFH out of budget. 

Other pertinent info - condos and townhouses are on the radar they just have high maintenance fees + special assessments are common due to deferred maintenance or increases insurance costs. Some buildings don’t qualify for a mortgage because they don’t carry full hurricane insurance. Condos seem to be more affected by this so we’re looking at primarily townhouses and SFHs.

Other important budget info - kid 1 is in preschool but that cost the same as daycare, kid 1 can go to public school in 2027. Kid 2 is still basically brand new so we’ll be paying daycare and then preschool for a while.

But back to the question. Should we be investing this money?",1732296686.0
personalfinance,Car loan from dealership,"So I recently bought a new car from a dealership and my financed amount (43,030.06) includes GAP INSURANCE (2,214). The dealer told me they I would be able to cancel this within 30 days, which I did. My original term before cancelling it is ;
 - Financed amount = $42,030.06
 - terms : 5 years (12 monthly payment a year)
 - interest apr = 7.29%
 - per their calculation my monthly payment is $832.19

Considering all the factors above, I got an enail that my monthly payment will stay the same but my term will be shorter after removing the GAP. I know that this reduces the total interest i need to pay but I want my term to stay the same (after removing that GAP cost), which I calculated around $792.19. 

The dealer said that “the payment will still be the same but making your term shorter .The reason being is that the GAP cost will be put towards your total amount to finance .”

personalfinance,Am I contributing enough to my 401k/Roth to maximize my employer contribution? How do I figure out if they've been,"I am terrible at math, and apparently reading comprehension so please bear with me.

My employer will make  an automatic contribution of 3% of my eligible compensation. [as paraphrased from Fidelity website].

My current contribution amount to my pre-tax 401k account is 2.5% and 1.5% for Roth. 5% each for bonuses. Is this enough to maximize what my employer says it will match? I was told as long as the percentages added up to at least 3, then I was good to go.

personalfinance,Making sure I understand fixed income funds.,"So, I've been looking at fixed income funds lately - specifically VHYAX. I'm pretty new to investing as I only started putting money in VFIAX a little more than a year ago, so please forgive any ignorant questions.

But, to clarify on VHYAX; the current SEC yield is 2.63 and the NAV is $39.94. For the sake of simplicity, let's make the huge assumption that these stay the same for a year.
To my understanding, that 2.63 means that I would receive 2.63% of the current NAV of VHYAX ($39.94) per-share quarterly.

So, if I invested $50,000 in VHYAX, that would buy me approximately 1,251 shares. If the NAV and SEC yield stayed static, then every three months I would receive $1.05 per-share, which would be $1,314.07.

\-30k on credit cards

\-10k in collections

\-4k personal loans

Due to my previous salary + a 2.75% mortgage rate / low monthly mortgage + not having childcare costs until more recently + student loan deferment during the pandemic + a generally frugal lifestyle... we were able to save up \~200K in savings + \~150K post-tax brokerage.

This was after maxing out our 401(k)s as well. We currently have a combined \~400K in our retirement accounts.

Most of our savings is in a HYSA because I had bought a few 12-18 mo CDs when rates were high that are maturing. 

With my new salary, daycare expenses, student loans back on the table, etc. we've had to reduce the amount we put into our 401ks and HSAs to just cover what our employers match.

All that to ask, should we take money out of our substantial savings each month in order to max out both our pre-tax retirement accounts? Put that savings into a post-tax brokerage? Pay off the student loans? Some combo?

personalfinance,Capital gains tax question- I promise I googled first!,"Hello friends of Reddit. I’m hoping someone can help me answer this question. I’m helping my mom sell a piece of property and I’m pretty confused about what her tax liability will be. The property is not her main residence, it’s a rural piece of property that had a hunting cabin on it that really is no longer being used. It was never rented out. She owns the property free and clear and it has been over 10 years since she owned it. From what I read, it appears that she would pay capital gains taxes on this property once it’s sold based on her income. So I have a few questions about this.


1. From what I read, it says the capital gains tax are based on your income. Is this her income prior to the sale of the property? Or her income after the sale of the property?


2. If it is based on her income prior to the sale of the property, is it true that a married couple or surviving spouse can make up to $98,000 and not be liable for capital gain taxes? my dad died this year, and my mom is on Social Security, so I’m trying to figure out the best time to sell the property for her. 


3. Am I missing anything here? Am I totally off the mark? I am a college educated woman, but finance is not my cup of tea! I really appreciate any help. Thank you so much!

personalfinance,Struggling with Partner's Financial Criticism and Unequal Contributions,"A good short title asking for advice/ I’m seeking financial advice. My partner and I agreed that I would take all maternity and parental leave (a total of 18 months in Quebec, 15 of which were paid) to care for our newborn child. Nine months after he was born, I started a master's program in counseling psychology. He agreed to co-sign a student line of credit with me. He never took any time off from his job, while I took all the time to care for our child. My son started daycare at 12 months, but due to feeding difficulties and other adaptation issues, the daycare frequently asked me to pick him up. After four months, I took him out and he was subsequently rejected from two other places (mainly due to not eating his meals and other behavioral issues related to separation anxiety). We decided he’d stay home with me for now until he was more mature.

Eventually, I had to be laid off because my job couldn’t keep me on leave after the 18 months, so I lost that income. I’m now at the end of my master's program and will begin my practicum in early 2025. Here are the issues I’m facing with my partner: he frequently brings up money and makes me feel guilty for using the line of credit (which I currently owe $43k on). He doesn’t appreciate that I stayed home with our son and downplays the fact that our son wasn’t ready for daycare. He also says that losing my low-income job (which paid around $55k a year) wasn’t a big deal.

He currently pays for my program, and we agreed that he’d cover the costs and I would repay him once I finish school. Since he helps pay for my education, he barely contributes financially to anything else and criticizes me whenever I spend money—whether it’s on food, clothing, toys, or even just a coffee. I’ve reached a point where he humiliates me, associating this with a lack of character and personality flaws. For example, he now says I’m financially irresponsible, that I’m a ""princess,"" and that I’m inconsequential. Meanwhile, I’ve spent half of my savings in my TFSA (about $20k) since our son was born.

As I mentioned, he pays for the school (money I’m supposed to repay), but here’s the issue: he barely contributes to anything else financially. He only covers half of the costs for wipes, diapers, clothing, and formula, which our son still needs due to some sensory processing issues and resistance to eating nutritious meals consistently. He doesn’t contribute to anything else in the house. He has his own apartment and comes to mine every day after work but sleeps at his apartment during weekdays because it’s closer to his office. He no longer contributes to food or anything else in the house, aside from the limited items I mentioned earlier.

I feel like I’ve made all the sacrifices to raise our son properly while still pursuing a master's degree to improve my career, even losing my job to protect our son. He doesn’t seem to recognize any of this and acts as though I’m taking money from him. Lately, he’s been offending and humiliating me a lot about it, and it’s affecting my mental health. I feel depressed when I think about the awful things he tells me daily (for instance, he says I’m financially taking advantage of him, that I’m an opportunist, among many other things). He can’t see reality for what it is and doesn’t recognize the sacrifices I’ve made. He maintains that he has to keep his job because he earns significantly more, but his savings are his alone, and his income is for himself, so it’s not like that benefits me in the long run.",1732281358.0

My company is based in the US and I am in Europe. I have been receiving my salary in USD to my WIse USD account and it has worked very well so far. Now, my company said they can pay me in my local currency EUR if I want to and this would be based on an agreed fixed amount that would be adjusted for exchange rate changes every six months.  This means the salary amount will change based on the exchange rate per January 1st and remain the same for six months until June for it to be changed again (based on June exchange rate) and continue in six month cycles.

I was thinking to still receive USD as this is more under my control (I can exchange it on my own). On the other hand fixed amount can be more advantage (if exchange rate is good at the time) at the same time risky (if ex. exchange rate is blocked at a low rate for six month).

I was wondering if anyone could give any advice on a question I have.

We currently have a lifetime policy in its first year that is due to end in December, and we have renewed the policy for year 2. Our dog needed to go the vets a couple of months ago as she had some itchy paws but it cleared up very quickly with no additional visits needed. So the total price came to £150. Our excess is £100 so we decided we would not claim as to not drive our premium up with the claim.   
  
I am now concerned that come next year, if the itching comes back and turns out to be an allergy or skin condition of some sort it will obviously cost us more in vet fees and at that point we will want to claim(not for the previous £150 though). At that point is it possible our insurance may decline the claim as they will be able to see on the medical that she had the visits in the previous year but we did not tell them about the issue? I am concerned they could pull some sort of ""didn't tell us about the condition"" card and say they can't cover it.  They didn't ask for any medical history prior to us signing up for our 2nd year, however if we do need to claim we will need to send the history. 

Am I right to be concerned, or because its a lifetime policy does it not matter if we didn't tell them because it still occurred whilst we were under their cover for year 1?

About 2 months ago, my husband (27m) lost his job. In that time, he was able to find a good paying job, but they let him go after a week, because he missed one day for a doctor’s appointment. 

He has been tirelessly searching for a job, but the bills don’t stop. The places I’ve called have been willing to work with us, but it’s just been an endless cycle of pushing back bills and playing catch up. 

We’re in the situation now where all our money is going towards catching up on bills. After paying everything due, we’re left with only $50 to feed ourselves and buy gas for two weeks. 

One tank of gas lasts me a week only commuting to work, and that alone is $60 to fill up the tank. (Oh, and the check engine light is on as well, but I know I can’t afford to fix it)

We were already living paycheck to paycheck, so we have no savings at the moment. My credit score is around 600, so it’s too low to open a credit card or obtain a personal loan. 

My husband filed for unemployment when he lost his job but they haven’t processed his claim, and attempts to contact them have resulted in the runaround. 

I’m salaried and my job has pretty long hours, so finding another job for me is hard to work around my schedule. I’ve tried looking for something higher paying but I work in a specialized field (journalism/graphic design) and higher paying jobs that utilize my skill set are scarce in my area.

So far all my searches are finding only the major commercial cards -- which I'll do if I can't find a CU with this -- but thought I'd see if others know of one?

I generally only use CUs sparingly, to pay for things like cell plan, Netflix, and a couple of others...but somehow my numbers have gotten leaked/stolen, which leads to cancelling the card, disputing charges, and then having to give new numbers to the businesses I use.

I’m a swe

I have $150k in savings
I have no debts (paid all my student loans and car loan)

I (27) want to move out of my parents home and buy a house, but all the good current inventory in my city are $800k+. Recently, the city I live in approved a new subdivision, with a plan of building around 1600 new dwelling units, mixed of single family homes (that the city states will be finished in 2026), town homes, condos and apartments. Should I wait to see if the cost of housing will go down once the subdivision is finished? Should I buy now that inflation is semi under control?

personalfinance,What would you do in my position?,"Hi. I'm in a financial position I never thought I'd be in, and would like some advice on how to proceed.

Due to a recent redundancy and inheritance I am in a position where I have £50k in cash savings and a £250k house which is mortgage free.

personalfinance,What can good credit actually get me (In the short-to-medium term),"Evening,

**TL;DR Basically I'm asking what are the advantages of having good credit besides loans.**

I've maintained a 'Okay-Good' credit score for about five years, hovering between 780 and at one point 800. I never wanted to get credit but I did so so I could help my mom with her credit by making her an authorized user (she wanted to buy a house, but apparently the credit gains from me didn't help her). 

Anyways, what exactly does good credit do for me, in the short term? I know that when I start applying for loans that my score basically gets me a better interest rate, but beyond that, and applying to higher-tier credit cards, I have no idea how to leverage it to help me in the short to medium term. Credit cards already 'help' with minor cash back and perks, but what else is there that I could use my credit for in day to day stuff?

Basically I'm asking what are the advantages of having good credit besides loans.

personalfinance,Pay down loans or invest in stocks,"Hello,

I have been paying more than required for my student and car loan, I know it doesn't make financial sense since it is worth more in the stock market. But I also want to stop paying the loans faster since it will be nice to be done paying them in 2 years rather than like 5. But if it's a dumb thing to do then I will stop.

Car loan- $17k owed, pay 500/month but been paying 700/month interest rate 6%

School- $13.5k owed $250/month but been paying 500/month interest rate 4%

So I could be putting an extra 450/month into stocks and my portfolio has gone up 35% in the last year.

I know basic math tells me the money is better in stocks but someone tell me I'm dumb because not having payments in 2 years rather than 5 also sounds really nice.

We have a home with a <3% mortgage, about $150k in equity. Bought for $520k, currently valued at probably closer to $700k
* I max out my 401k and is combined with a profit sharing account, with a 9.3% company match. It sits at around $312k. I currently somewhat split traditional and Roth contributions into a Target 2060 fund (less than ideal but haven’t taken the time to investigate other options).
* Her supplemental retirement I believe is around $100k. (County employee so there’s also pension involved, no traditional 401k, etc)
* HSA is at ~$10k, just started investing it into a blended fund, and switched my contributions to max it out starting next year.
* Our HYSA sits at ~$37k. We use the “live on last months earnings” technique so there’s ~$20k in our checking
* We both started a back door Roth only this year. (One thing I regret). They’re both at ~7k.
* My brokerage account is ~$68k along with ~$23k ESPP.
* Her brokerage (which we don’t contribute much to) is around $23k I believe.
* I’ve got a mutual fund position from my grandfather opening a custodial account years ago that sits at around ~$55k. 
* She has a similar position in a single stock paying semiannual dividends of around $1400, and the position is valued at around $127k.

Buy SPY puts (0.5% of your portfolio) target price of $413 (30% below) with expiration of 2 months. After a month, sell and repeat. If the market stays normal, those options won't drag your portfolio but if there is a crash, that 0.5% will go up so much, saving your portfolio. The Roth-IRA account is so in case your options go up in value 20X-40X, you won't have to pay capital gains. With that money, you purchase more shares of SP500 fund.

That way, if the SP500 continues to climb, you'll be doing great. The options is to be able to sleep at night knowing you're protected in case of a crash.

I will be getting a small windfall of about $12k by year's end and had a jump in my income enough to where I'm able to meaningfully afford COL. I want to buy a used car as ours is not reliable enough and expensive to repair. I am very low risk tolerant on this car purchase as I want to make sure it'll last us through my next 6 or so years of school without too many emergencies, as a result Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist scare me lol. I live near a pretty wealthy city so you can get cool deals but naturally, many scams or rebuilt titles as well. I understand I can do an inspection and my own research but I've still heard so many horror stories from DIY purchases 😭

Going through a used car lot, though, they'd want me to finance for the best deal. I'm post BK though so that pushes me into the worst dealers who won't give nice deals. Or I can pay cash but I've heard you're also probably going to get overpriced paying cash unless you just avoid telling them or something. There's one dealer in town that apparently is pretty straight to the point and transparently priced that I can at least try out with cash-in-hand. 

I am getting a substantial tax return, too, but need a car by New Year's so I technically can afford about $15k worth of car comfortably while only having 4/5ths of that in hand by year's end. So financing a car seems beneficial in some other regards as well but it just doesn't seem possible with a BK. At that point do I just ask my credit union if I can put a $12k down payment on a $15k loan and they can hold on to the car title for a few months? I guess that completely misses the point of dealer financing for a discount on the car but it could rebuild credit and avoid predatory lenders.

In reviewing my credit report, the auto loan is listed as “closed” and noted as a repossession. Admittedly, I’m not the best at checking my credit report but I do know for certain that the repossession was not reported for at least a year. 

My balance is correct and the most recent payment is listed as being for this month (which is correct). Up until the month of repossession, every payment is noted to be made on time and current (yes, I never missed a payment but my car was still repossessed… a story for another day). Beginning on the month of the repossession and every month thereafter, all payments are marked with an “R” for reposessed. It provides no further details on these payments, however I have made all of the payments on time and have receipts saved to prove it. When I login to pay my loan, it reflects this as well and shows that my loan is up to date.  

I am so confused… why is this displaying like a bad debt? When will it go away? I was entertaining the idea of paying off the balance but now I am nervous (probably unnecessarily) that the asset will not be mine.

personalfinance,Help me decide if I should buy a cheap house or keep renting? ,"My (27F) fiancé (28M) and I are moving to a new area in August 2025, and planned to rent for about until 2028 in the new area while we save up money for a down payment for our “forever home” (~400-600k budget). 

HOWEVER, we’ve recently realized that in the area we are moving to, rent ranges from $1650 - $2600 per month. 

We are considering buying a cheap house ~$170k hoping the mortgage will cost around $1,200 per month. Even with additional cost for upkeep and repairs (maybe $300/month ish), this would be equal to the lower end of the cost of rental in our area, AND we would be gaining equity. 

Is it wise to buy this cheap house when our true goal is to buy a “forever home” in 2028? 

Factors: 
- Dual income will be ~$310k per year pre-tax 
- Dual debts (school loans) ~13.5k per year 
- Need to purchase a new car ASAP ~20k 

SPECIAL FACTORS
- Due to his profession, my fiancé will be able to qualify for a special kind of mortgage where he can do 0% down on his first home. I’m having a hard time thinking it is worth it to “use up” this amazing deal on a cheap ~170k home, instead of using it on our more expensive forever home. So, if we do buy a cheaper home, would it be wise for me to purchase it in my name only in 2026 (pre-marriage)? Will he still be able to use the deal on his “first” home after we marry in 2027?

personalfinance,Should I liquidate all my investments to buy a house with 20% down or keep my investments and go for an FHA loan?,"Hi all,
I’m in a bit of a financial dilemma and would love some advice. I have around $70k invested outside of my 401(k) across stocks, bonds, and other assets. I’m thinking about using these funds for a 20% down payment on a house to avoid PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) and keep my mortgage payments lower.

However, I’m also considering leaving my investments in the market and going for an FHA loan, which would allow me to buy a house with just 3.5% down, keeping my investments intact and possibly benefiting from market growth.

Here’s what I’m weighing:

Option 1 (Liquidate investments for 20% down): Avoid PMI, lower monthly payments, and fully own a larger portion of the home right away. But, I’d be pulling out most of my investments, which could be difficult to get back into once liquidated.
Option 2 (Use 3.5% FHA loan): Keep my $70k in the market, potentially benefit from growth, but my monthly mortgage payments will be higher due to PMI and possibly a higher interest rate.
What do you think is the best financial move here? Should I prioritize avoiding PMI, or is it better to stay invested and accept the higher costs of an FHA loan?

personalfinance,Retirement Investment Strategy Feedback,"After browsing this sub as well as various other investment related subs, I’ve tried to lay out a plan that will lead to a successful retirement. I’m currently 29M making \~$64K in a LCOL area. I’ve had some ups and downs to get where I am currently, but I’ve found a career path that I will likely continue on until retirement. I currently have $21K in a traditional 401K and $3600 in a personal Roth IRA. My employer has a 5% match as well. My plan going forward is as follows:

$100/week from paychecks Roth IRA – investing into SCHD so dividend reinvestment grows tax free.

$100/week into pretax 401k which is investing in a S&P 500 equivalent.

Based on the above, I’d be contributing $8,400/yr into trad 401K (with match) and $5200/yr to Roth. For ease of calculation, I’m assuming 30 years at 7% growth on the 401K and 6% growth on the Roth SCHD investment (3% stock growth, 3% dividend reinvestment). Future value shows that the 401K with match should come out to \~$950K and the ROTH SCHD comes out to \~$420K. When I retire at 60, I can comfortably take $55k/year (before tax) from the 401K. The Roth will continue to grow without additional investment, but I can pull from the dividends if needed.

One thing that I’ve been back and forth on is what to do in the Roth IRA, particularly when it comes to raw market growth vs the dividend snowball. Since my weekly contribution is so low, SCHD is appealing because I can immediately have most of my money working for me. The same could be said if I invested into a mutual fund such as SWPPX because of partial shares.

personalfinance,Help us decide what to do with end of year bonus,"I am fortunate enough to have a pretty decent job with a generous (for us at least) bonus structure. The beginning of the year it's going to be roughly 16-18k take home. Hard to say exactly because they don't give us that info until end of January but it's going to be larger than last year which was about 15k take home. 

Now for the question. My wife's car has $13k left to pay at 2.9% interest. We could pay this off completely and still have a little extra to either put in savings or go towards something else. The only other major debts besides house would be her student loan which is about $22k and interest across the various loans is sort of all over the place. Not entirely sure how it works with paying some of those off if we are able to pick and choose, etc. Would our monthly payment go down from $250 if we paid off some portions? And my car is at $16k 0% interest.

I know and hear horror stories about student loan debt but I didn't go to school and never had any to pay off myself. The kicker for this is my wife lost her job in March and we've been doing pretty well budgeting on one income. She's looking to go back to work when our youngest starts school in August. Paying off the car would put $500 a month back in our pocket which in my mind, would help us pay for the loan each month and have extra cash for whatever we need. It was tight before when her loan was frozen. Yearly salary increase should hopefully offset the cost and cover that monthly payment. But we'd still like to make the best decision here for our immediate future of getting back out of debt, even while only being on one income. 

TLDR:

Wife car $500/month @2.9%
Student loans $22k @ varying percentages, none higher than 5.
My car $425/month @0%

My credit score and profile is better than two years ago. I understand that in some cases to re-extend the loan for more interest in the long run vs just pumping more to principal can be illogical. 

I have eliminated all debts except for this one. Only bill is house payment. 

What would the opinion be on refinancing for 50% reduction in monthly payment (hypothetically) to continue dumping more money into principal? Regardless of ""total interest"" of a new note? 

Key notes: Cars value (year and mileage). Idk how the engine rebuild factors in to value. I don't believe a traditional banking system would refinance given this criteria. Possibly a credit union. 

If my plan is to dump to principal as much as I can would it be worth it to possibly refinance for a better interest rate and monthly payment just to save 50% /month ? I now have a significant portion of my monthly budget as disposable

Went to sos got a new license. And froze my credit score cause I think they have my social security card with the number. Any advice? Am I forgetting anything? Is there anything I should be doing?

personalfinance,What to do with low value Traditional IRA that I don't plan to contribute to,"Hi I am a mid 40s state government worker who has been there 20 years with most of my retirement in pension and 457b. I opened a traditional IRA (Sofi) a few years ago and contributed about $600 (value is now around $800). I stopped contributing to this after realizing I get no tax deduction due to my income. I now opened a Roth IRA (also Sofi) that has a few grand in it. I also have an old rollover traditional IRA with Voya from a company I worked for years ago. This has been sitting at around the same balance ($1500ish) for decades and I cannot figure out how to transfer to a better company or to even change what is invested in it. 

I have 2 questions: 

1. should I keep the $800 in the traditional IRA and let it continue to very slowly grow for the next 15 or so years or should I bite the bullet and pay taxes on it now and transfer the funds to my Roth?
2. what should I do with my VOYA IRA? Should I try and get it transferred to SOFI, should I try and get it invested in something else with VOYA (I've been all over their site and it is terrible), should I bite the bullet and withdraw the money paying taxes and fees and put into my Roth?

Main reasons I am wanting to maybe do something is because there is a possibility that I will need to go backdoor Roth in a few years. Thanks in advance.",1732229600.0
personalfinance,"Is a lower monthly payment on a vehicle with a bit of a higher apr better than a higher payment, with a bit of a lower apr? ","Hey guys!

My mom is in a bit of a dilemma and honestly I’m not to sure on how to help her make a decision.

She’s financing a vehicle with a 7.65% APR, and a monthly payment of $388. She was recently approved to refinance her car with Navy Federal Credit Union, increasing the APR of the vehicle to 8.79%, but lowering her monthly payment to $335. 

She’s not particularly in a great financial situation, with about $10k in credit card debt. So she appreciates the fact that the minimum monthly payment will be a bit lower, but is this worth it to refinance the car?

personalfinance,Can creditors pin this on me?,"
My dad has cancer and he's going to die, it might be a few months, maybe a year.
He is a U.S. resident but hasn't worked in like a year due to the cancer, he recently moved back overseas but continues to use his U.S. credit cards to cover expenses there and back in the U.S.
He might lose the residency by January/February for being out of the country more than 6 months by then.
He will probably live his remaining days overseas, back home.

I was a stupid teenager and assumed I would be able to pay it off at a later time (not knowing how long I would be unemployed and not on unemployment) and forgot about the account. Oddly enough I only received one phone call/email for a payment (which I threw my last $200 at) before a few months later when it was closed and written as a charge off. After finishing college and managing to get a very well paying job and paying down my student loans this account is now having a massive impact on ability for loans, mortgages, and other credit accounts.

I have tried again and again to reach somewhere to pay this account off at the very least. Usually I start with the Barclay's number listed on my credit report, once they ask my information and find the charge-off account I'm usually directed to somewhere else. Calling this number then has me wait until it hangs up before giving me a DIFFERENT number...after calling that and successfully getting someone on the line (probably not a domestic call center I would imagine...very sketchy) I get stuck in a hold loop until it eventually hangs up.

My credit reports say the account will stay on record until April 2027, what will happen to my credit score following that?

My (f22) dad (m55) passed away unexpectedly Saturday and my siblings ( C f34, M m25, R f23) and I have been trying to figure out his life insurance/401k info. 

My dad worked at a company (we will call it “D”) for 25 years until 2020 when he switched to “P”. 
When my dad passed he had life insurance through New York life. My sibs weren’t very close to dad, and mom and him got divorced a year or two ago. My brother and aunt called P and let the company know he passed away and asked about life insurance. They told both of them that dad was unemployed at time of death and that he didn’t have life insurance. Obviously we are all upset because now we have 12k in funeral expenses that we aren’t sure how we will pay in 30 days and we had NO clue he was unemployed. I talked with him regularly and he never mentioned anything about quitting so soon. 

My oldest sister C emailed them and they told her he DID have life insurance and I was named the sole beneficiary. The benefits director from P called me and let me know. I was in such shock that dad put me as the only beneficiary but I tried to write down as much as possible. She said he had 137k in it but also that the total was 370k??? 
She sent me the file I will have to sign and send back with his death certificate when we get it. She said that once that info gets sent in New York Life will determine if any exclusions apply since he was separated with the company at time of death. 



I’m just very confused because in the life insurance claim file it asks;

if he was considered an employee at time of death? It’s marked yes

Was the employee actively at work until time of death? It’s marked no (employment ended)

If the Employee was not actively at work immediately prior to his/her death or Dependent’s death, what was the reason? It’s marked discharged 

Was coverage still in effect during date of death? It’s marked no (the policy was going to be converted)

While of course salary increase is a goal of a new position, there is desire to get back into more of an R&D/design/technically fulfilling role as well. That being said, I am trying to figure out the best way to value the railroad retirement benefit in my pursuit of a new position

Some stats:
Age 35
Salary: $130,000
Bonus: looks like it will shake out to about 8%
401k: 7% match, currently maxing out (total value ~450k)
Roth IRA: maxing out (current  value $225k)
Taxable brokerage: $190k

Railroad tier  2 - 4.9% paycheck deduction - call it a defined benefit annuity.

Tier 1 would pay out  $47160 per year
Tier  2 would pay out $25608
If I were to return to a non RR job, social security estimate is $39780 per year

Context: I have read the prime directive, Bogleheads on windfall, etc. Looking for some opinions from the group as my path forward doesn't seem to have an obvious answer.

I recently started a new job and now that all the bonuses, PTO payouts, etc have landed, I find myself with around $40k in excess cash. I'll also be receiving a stock grant of around $100k next month.

I'm 28 years old. 401k + Roth + HSA are all fully maxed. I have fully funded emergency fund, no CC debt. Healthy post-tax brokerage account as well (\~$130k).

My only consumer debt is a land loan (32 acres of unimproved land) which currently sits at \~$49k @ 6.875% interest. Minimum payment is around $670, but I pay $850 on it monthly.

I'm torn on whether or not to pay off the land. I don't need the additional cash flow, and 6.875% interest is right around historical rate of return for the market. Paying it off would probably be more of an emotional decision than anything else.

As far as other financial plans, I plan to buy a house in the next \~5 years. I feel as though I already have a sufficient down payment saved for the house I would be targeting so I don't feel immediate pressure to add more to that piggy bank. I could just as well pay off the land loan and redirect the $850/mo into my post-tax account (which is ostensibly my down-payment fund).

Appreciate any and all advice!",1732220065.0
personalfinance,Need to make 2500 for rent -- from home -- disabled family member at home I take care of,"Hello,

I take care of my disabled dad and he presently doesn't qualify for any assistance. I can't leave him alone as it would be dangerous and two lawyers said I couldn't for if something happens I could get charged with a crime.

Lost job 9 months ago and landlord doesn't care and will evict if rent is not paid on time. Have enough for next month but after that will be at zero.

Is there anything I could do from home to make money? Nothing illegal or that doesn't involve nudity. We're nearly maxed out on credit cards so it's not like I can put down any capital down to start a business. I can grill decently but I can't leave the house and take a fast-food job, cause can't leave dad lone. It might take months and months to get any type of assistance at home due to waitlists and no nursing homes will take him b/c of his medical condition. I tried and called and was told no from different places.

I figured if someone would know they could let me know. The job market has been brutal this past year.

personalfinance,"Partner and I can't get approved for apartment even with a cosigner, just because my credit is bad. ","So my fiancée and I find ourselves in a frustrating situation. The income requirement for the apartment we are interested in is 3 times the rent. My fiancée alone makes over 4.5 times the monthly rent. I make a small amount but not much because I am still a student. Neither of us have any debt. We both have previous renting history separately. Her credit score is good (high 700s). I have never had a credit card or borrowed money so going in we expected I would have no credit to speak of. I didn't even check my credit score. But we should have been fine, our other circumstances should have been enough. 

What we didn't know was that when they ran my credit we found that due to previously undiscovered identify theft my credit score is toast(488). We were ""approved with conditions"" because of this. Our options are:

1. Get a cosigner  
2. Pay a $600 non refundable security fee

  
Obviously we don't want to pay the 600, so we thought to have her mother be the cosigner. But it turns out that cosigner's income must be 4.5 times the rent! Her mother does not make that much, so we are afraid that she will not be approved. It just does not make sense to me that a cosigner is needed due to my bad credit, but the cosigner requirement that we are stuck on is based on income, which my fiancée should take care of all on her own. Basically the cosigner isn't giving them any extra security in our case.

  
I have submitted everything needed to clear my name and fix my credit score, but it will take 30-90 days and we do not have the time to wait that long for this apartment. The apartment agency will not recognize my identity theft situation as legit until the whole thing is settled and removed from my credit. We have tried suggesting a few things to the apartment agency with no success. We have tried:

\- Asking if we can pay the $600 and then get it back once my credit clears. They say no, which is frustrating, because all my research shows this fee is almost always refundable or part of the security deposit. They are holding on to it for no reason.

\- Asking if I can be removed from the application

\- Asking if her mother could be a cosigner anyways since all together the income is more than enough. This option could work, but the cosigner application is $50 even if she is not approved and we would still have to pay $600 at that point.

  
Any suggestions or ideas on what action to take? Is it worth the risk to attempt the cosigner solution? This whole situation seems very unnecessary.",1732219391.0

personalfinance,"With regards to buying a vehicle online, how accurate are the prices I'm seeing?","My car has had some engine trouble and while it isn't dire, it has got me thinking about upgrading vehicles, so I decided to just browse a bit online. For the sake of discussion let's use a 2024 Toyota Tacoma, I want to upgrade from a sedan to a more utility vehicle for outdoors hobbies and let's say I decided the Tacoma was where it's at.

Looking at local Toyota dealers, I'm seeing tons of new trucks at around $42k for base packages and models, but when I use the official Toyota dealership site, I can build a model from scratch and get an estimated cost for the build. The MSRP here is now 36,735 including about 1,500 in delivery/processing/handling fees per the site. A little further down I see that there is the same local dealership advertising a similar style of Tacoma (2024, so not pre-owned) for $32,911.21 which is decidedly below MSRP. 

So I guess I'm just a bit confused, is that it? After taxes, cash payments and trade-ins would I truly be paying that $32k via financing like the website suggests or am I missing something here? I feel like this can't be it considering base searches at this local dealership's website netted absolutely zero searches of the kind!

I guess this can be summarized as a 'What costs should I be concerned about when buying a new car', but ultimately, it's a bit more about clarity of price points being shown. ",1732218747.0

personalfinance,Pay off Student Loans or bulk up E-fund?,"Hi there, long time lurker. I generally understand finances well but I need some outside perspective on what my current goals should be. Here are the stats:

I am 27 years old. I started getting my budgeting shit together when I was around 24 after making a series of poor financial decisions and did the snowball method to pay off several debts along with some Dave Ramsey advice which I have started to move away from. I use YNAB religiously but I do splurge occasionally on dining out, giving gifts, but I have never paid a lick of interest on my credit cards. 

Take home pay: $4k/mo

Expenses: $3k/mo average but if I scrimp, forego therapy sessions, etc. would be $2.5k/mo

Any remaining funds that I did not account for are usually going into budget categories for gifts, vacations, taxes, etc. Probably about $1k that floats around, gets used up and refills.

Debt: 

$8k on 2019 Kia Niro EX Hybrid, \~1.5 years left on loan at 6.5%, $475 monthly payment

$1.2k on student loans at 4.2%, started with \~$25k and am almost free! :) I put $700 a month towards this currently. Normal payment of about $70/mo.

Savings:

$23k in retirement (I know I am behind, wanted to pay off debt before aggressively saving for retirement. I get a 6% match on my 401k ($78k a year salary) and contribute about $50/month to other stock options thru acorns.)

$5k liquid savings for a 2-month emergency fund. 

So here is where I need help. Do I bulk up my emergency fund to 6 months before continuing to pay off my student loan? The amount of interest it will be gaining in that time is pretty low. I don't have a ton of wriggle room as it stands although my long term partner makes more than enough to support us in a pinch ($130k) though I do not rely on him for anything financially. Maybe I'm approaching it the wrong way and should be paying down the car first?

In addition to endometriosis, I frequently see a dermatologist for ongoing skin issues and currently see a liver specialist since both my parents have liver disease. I’m worried that switching to an HDHP might cause my out-of-pocket costs to skyrocket and offset the benefits of having an HSA.

Here’s a snapshot of my current situation:

**Current Plan (POS):**

* Premium: $68.99 per paycheck
* Deductible: $1,500 (didn’t make a dent in it this year)
* Out-of-Pocket: $7,900
* Out-of-network costs this year: $195
* Out-of-pocket costs this year: $779.11 (mostly medications, specialist appointments, and labs)

**HDHP Option:**

* Premium: $12.53 per paycheck
* Deductible: $5,000 
* Out-of-Pocket: $6,900 

Employer does provide any money to the HSA

More details on my plan options: https://imgur.com/a/pIZN9ag

**Financial Background:**

* Income: $93K (up to $102K if I hit my full bonus in March)
* Retirement: $40K saved so far, maxed out 5% company match and Roth IRA for the year
* Down payment savings: $43K in a HYSA, actively adding more
* Investments: \~$6K in miscellaneous accounts
* Partner and I are planning for a wedding in 2026

TLDR: Is an HDHP with an HSA the right option for IVF savings for someone with chronic health issues? I’m drawn to the tax savings and investment growth potential of an HSA, but I’m worried my medical expenses in the next few years might make an HDHP less cost-effective overall.

personalfinance,"Car Advice for a Young Family of 3 (1 Income, $75k)","We’re a young family (both 23) with a 6-month-old baby, and I’m debating whether to trade in our 2019 Chevy Trax for a 2024 Toyota Corolla LE. Here’s the situation:

	•	Trax Details:
	•	$327/month, ~3 years left on the loan.
	•	Owe ~$9k, about what it’s worth (no negative equity).
	•	Warranty is expiring soon.
	•	It’s running fine now, but it has overheated and stranded my wife twice recently. I’m worried about future repair bills.
	•	Corolla Details:
	•	MSRP: $23k.
	•	Down Payment: $500–$2k.
	•	Financing: 4.99% for 5 years or 5.5% for 6 years.
	•	Goal: Keep it long-term (200–300k miles if well maintained).

Financial Background:

	•	Income: $75k/year (I’m the sole earner; wife is a SAHM).
	•	Savings: 20% savings rate, 2–3 months in our emergency fund.
	•	Debt: $30k in federal student loans at <5% interest; $118/month payment.
	•	Living Situation: Moving in with her family to save for a house in a few years.
	•	Current Backup Car: A paid-off 2010 Camry with 180k miles (reliable but aging).
I am also contributing 3% to my 401k with a match. It’s not much right now but it’s something 😁.

The Dilemma:

	1.	Keep the Trax: Pay it off over the next 3 years and deal with potential repair costs.
	2.	Trade for Corolla: Get a reliable new car now with manageable payments (~$400–$450/month).

Reliability is our top concern since we have a baby and only one income. If my Camry dies, we need a dependable car for my wife. I like the Corolla for its reputation (I’ve loved my Camry), but I’m unsure if this is the right move with a house purchase on the horizon.

Would you recommend trading for the Corolla or sticking it out with the Trax? Any advice is appreciated!

Edit: Option 3 is selling the Trax for more than our outstanding loan balance and buying a beater with the surplus. If I was single this would be my choice, but we have a baby and I have to provide at all costs yknow? ",1732212459.0
personalfinance,28 and New to Roth IRAs - Guidance Appreciated,"Hey everyone! I just stumbled upon the Personal Income Spending Flowchart, and I've been deep in the personal finance rabbit hole for the past 48 hours. Finance and investing feel like foreign languages to me, so I’d appreciate any guidance—and some patience with my ignorance, as I'm still learning the ropes.

It was only yesterday that I realized my Roth 401(k) was different from a personal Roth IRA, which explains the title! Here’s a rundown of my situation, and I’m open to feedback on each part:

**Overall Finances:**  
I’m debt-free (no credit card debt or student loans) and recently started investing. I have about $12k in the crypto market (mostly profits from putting my stimulus checks into it in 2020).

**New Roth IRA:**  
I just opened a self-directed Roth IRA through SoFi, though I’ve read most people suggest Vanguard, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab. Did I make a mistake by choosing SoFi? My plan is to max out the $6,500 contribution for 2024.

**Employer 401(k):**  
I contribute to my employer’s 401(k) through Alliance using their balanced investment model. I was contributing $400 per paycheck but recently reworked it to $241.67 (7% of my salary toward the 401(k) and 8% toward my personal Roth IRA to hit the 15% retirement savings benchmark). My employer matches $119.59.

**Additional Accounts:**  
Before I learned about opening a personal Roth IRA, I opened both a brokerage account and an automated brokerage account through SoFi. I’m currently transferring funds out of the automated account because I wasn’t satisfied with its performance. Here’s the breakdown:

* **SoFi HYSA:** $30k
* **SoFi Checking:** $5k
* **Alliance Employer 401(k):** $11k
* **Old Employer 401(k) (need to track this account down):** $1.6k
* **SoFi Brokerage:** $500 in VOO, $50 in QQQ
* **SoFi Automated Brokerage:** $500 (moving this to my regular brokerage soon). Open to suggestions on where to allocate my brokerage funds for maximum growth.

**Investment Strategy:**  
I’m looking for suggestions on a specific asset allocation for US stocks, international stocks, and bonds. The selections are very overwhelming for me I’m familiar with the three-fund portfolio concept, but there are so many options, and all the acronyms feel overwhelming. For context, I’m on SoFi—so any advice on options available through that platform would help. I’m thinking of going aggressive: something like 40% US stocks, 40% international stocks, and 20% bonds. However, I’d be happy to adjust the bond percentage down and go more aggressive given my age, steady income, and job security. 

Any advice on fund choices, platform concerns, or how to approach my investment mix would be much appreciated! Thank you in advance.",1732212397.0
personalfinance,How to get out of “must save every penny mindset” after house purchase ,"I grew up in relatively lower middle class (40-45k for family of 4) and my first job (grad school) out of college paid 27k. Those two experiences made me super thrifty - never taken a vacation as an adult, very debt averse, have guilt with most non food spending. There were years where we struggled to buy food and I knew if I got sick we couldn’t afford to go to the doctor. After grad school I got a well paying job (around 175k post raises now, started at 135k) but only increased my lifestyle costs  a bit (no longer having a roommate ) usually putting 75% of my paycheck into savings. Which is how I was able to buy a house at 30 without help. I now pay ~30% of my post tax post 401k income on mortgage, car and utilities and about 10% on food, fun, my cats and dog, etc. I don’t really have any other expenses. Now that I’m not saving for a house, I don’t really need to be saving at such a high rate. What is a reasonable % to save? I’d like to take a vacation to Japan eventually and build a garage. 

I think living at the edge of poverty as a kid really skewed how I view my adult finances and what is a healthy and “safe” amount of spending. I logically know I’m in a good place but I don’t know what’s reasonable for spending.

I'm 27 years old and I have a 60k salary in NYC. Since I got my job in 2021, I burned through my money on restaurants, bars, travel, gifts, and entertainment and *never* saved. I didn't budget at all nor did I strategize what I used my credit card for. This summer, I had no savings, barely anything in my checking account, and around $6k of debt on my only credit card. It was a big wakeup call.

I spent the past few months paying off the card then I closed the card in fear of using it again It was a Capital One Quicksilver One card with an annual fee and a pretty high APR around 30%. I had it since 2021.

I now know it was a mistake to close the account - it lowered my credit score by 84 points (746 to 662). I was pretty motivated by the guilt and shame of my debt and didn't trust myself keeping the card open. I was also listening to my dad's advice, who said to close it immediately even though it would hurt my score. I know he didn't tell me it in bad faith and just didn't want me to keep using it irresponsibly. Today I have $0 in available credit and 0% credit usage. My other accounts are school loans that have been paid off. I can't take it back now and want to move forward and educate myself more.

This fall, I made a savings account, high yields savings account, and am contributing to the 401k plan my work provides. I'm already saving a bit in each account. It feels good to learn how to build stability for myself. I was just stopping myself from doing it before by staying uneducated and spending whenever I got paid.

Now that I started saving and know I'm capable of doing it, I want to work on rebuilding my credit so one day I can get a home loan, car loan, or whatever else.

I know that car prices are very high, and I’m looking at a used car to buy, and I’m not sure what I should do in the best way for me to get a car. I’m starting a job soon, 20/hr and I’ll be working 35-40 hours a week, so I will have all that income to pay for a car and payments. 

Now the difficult part is it’s starting to become cold and dark, which makes it difficult for me to get to work, I bike 20-30 miles daily to get to and from work, and as the weather gets colder and eventually rainy, I run a lot higher risks of danger, getting sick, being overly physically exhausted, so I feel that I need a car. 

I found a car for $5,600, it’s in good condition and has decent mileage, I’ve done lots of car research but I’m lacking in the financial aspect. I’m not sure what I should do to get the car in my situation. I’m debating whether or not to get a loan to pay for the car, and if that would be a smart decision. I have 3 plans for how I think it could work.

1. Save as much as I can from my job and try to get through the conditions until I have enough saved ($5,600-6,500)

2. Get a small loan ($2,000) and make a down payment and pay the car off monthly

3. Get a bigger loan ($5,000-6,000) and buy the car outright, but pay back a bank for a loan rather than a monthly payment

My only expenses would be the car until I pay it off completely, so 60-70% of my income would be to pay for the car and own it asap. 
I want to be aware of insurance, gas, fees, and maintenance, so I’m going to put around $550 (est.) towards those for monthly expenses, but all my other income would be mine to spend on the car, so around $2,000 a month estimated. I could pay the car/loan off in 3-4 months, but I’ve never taken a loan out and am very terrified of debt, as I have extremely little ‘savings’, if you could even call it that.

Background: I'm pretty healthy, I exercise every day, eat well, healthy body weight, no meds, etc. I only see the doctor maybe once or twice a year. Typically just a physical and maybe a random event, like I had food poisoning earlier this year for the first time. 

My employer offers 3 health plans and below are the options:

1. Low Deductible: $675 annual deductible, $5,500 OOP max, at $110 premium per bi-weekly paycheck

2. $1,800 annual deductible, $5,900 OOP max, at $85 premium per bi-weekly paycheck. 


    I chose this earlier this year, but because I'm no where near reaching the deductible, I've been paying for the appointments I've made in full, which is what I would have done with the HDHP, but I'm paying higher premiums out of my paycheck.

3. High Deductible with HSA $3,600 annual deductible, $6,000 OOP max, at $52 premium per bi-weekly paycheck. **Additionally, my employer would contribute $700 annually to my HSA**

personalfinance,403(b) Not anywhere *near* where it should be,"I am 44, have been at my current job for 20 years, and have two 403(b)s. One I pay into and the other my employer matches into. I have no idea why it is set up that way. Likely it has something to do with me being 24 when I set it up. I have always contributed the maximum that my employer will match.

I just found out that the one my employer pays into is sitting at $20,000. I find this highly concerning given that I've paid that much into it. Isn't a 403(b) supposed to grow beyond what you contribute? Shouldn't I have significantly more than what I've paid in after 20 years? What could I be doing wrong here?

EDIT: After a little research, the 403(b) *is* invested, but the investments it's in have apparently been performing horribly for a long, long time. It looks like my portfolio was basically wiped out in 2008 and never really recovered.

EDIT #2: I got ahold of the account manager and there are two things going on with this. First and foremost, apparently at some point in the past my employer was contributing significantly less to the account than they are now, so the money that's gone into the 403(b) is actually several thousand less than I thought. It's still performing poorly, but not nearly as poorly as I initially thought. The second thing is that 40% of the fund was in low-interest bonds. That has now been reallocated to actual investments.",1732207250.0
personalfinance,How to handle paying my $60k in Student Loans as well as try to invest,"Hi, I was wondering what would be the best idea to handle my student loans (which is also the only debt I have). I currently make roughly $55k a year, and my SL are also $60k. I am enrolled in the PAYE plan, paying only $40 per month towards the balance. I know that this will never go away like this, but I am nervous about trying to pay it off. 

I come from a low-income family, so I was never raised with an idea of how to handle money - part of how I ended up with such a high SL balance. I want to invest into my Roth IRA to max it out, as well as save up for future expenses (new car, kids, etc.) 

I don't know the best way to go about all of this. 

My income after-tax is $3400, and my fixed expenses are $1050 every month. I usually spend roughly $850-$1000 on myself for different things (food, gas, etc). That may be high, and I can try to cut back if it is a detriment. All together, this usually leaves me around $1300-$1500 a month to do with as I need.

Would it be wise to make the $700-ish minimum payments on my SLs to pay off in 10 years, and save/invest the remaining money? Or would it make more sense to continue to pay the $40 payments I currently do, and then save/invest the $1300-$1500 a month?",1732207062.0

personalfinance,Caught between wanting to buy a house a few years down the line and not wanting to miss out on potential stock market gains,"Hello all. I wonder if anyone else is in a similar situation to me. I would like to buy a home in the next few years, but am stuck in between not really knowing when a home will be affordable to me, and not knowing wanting to miss out on investment gains. I know the last steps of the flow chart say to delineate saving for large purchases in cash or in stocks based on a 3-5 year timeline (right now we have no kids, and live in a very low rent 1 bedroom, so no reason to move), but I feel that I might be right in the middle of this timeline for buying a home (maybe in 4 years). My wife and I have a combined salary of about 185k, and live in a VHCOL area. We have about 140k saved in non retirement funds, and save about an additional 2500 a month in non retirement funds.  We are earlier 30s have about 100k in retirement fund, 15k in an HSA (and contribute regularly to both) and no debts higher than 3% interest (2.5% interest car loan with 14k, 0% interest loan with 3K, 3% interest student loan with 2k). 

  
Because of the situation we are in, where I feel we will likely be looking to purchase a home in 3-5 years, I save 50% of this as cash (HYSA or money market), 15% in conservative mutual funds/ETFs, 15% in growth mutual funds/ETFs, 10% stocks, 10% bonds. Because of stock market gains, only about 55k of our 140k is in cash or equivalents.

personalfinance,I need help understanding a 401k withdraw. ,"So I’m experiencing financial hardship. I unexpectedly got fired from my job. On top of that I’m in the process of appealing my unemployment that was originally denied. I have never been super financially savvy. I’m 25 years old and I live in NY. I have some money in credit card debt. And without the unemployment I wouldn’t be able to make rent as I don’t have much of a cash savings. I don’t have any family to support me or ask for any advice on this. My credit score isn’t great due to my card habits so I can’t apply for a new or higher limit credit card. 

I was making 75k a year. I’m taxed at 22%. I currently have 80k in my 401k. I was depositing around 15% of my paycheck to my 401k and this includes some bonuses from my employer that are fully vested.

I just want to make sure I’m properly understanding how a withdraw would work. So if I were to take out say 15k. There would be a 10% penalty due to my age so $1,500. The income tax applied would be my 22% so $3,300. So I would have the $10,200 leftover. My intent with this money is to pay off my credit card debt (about 4k). And then keep the remainder for my rent and utilities while I appeal unemployment and job search. 

So I’m assuming Vanguard would auto take out their 10%. So would my withdraw just transfer into whatever checking account I place it in? And then I should just put the $3,300 aside in a savings account to have when taxes are due right? ",1732206044.0

personalfinance,Which will be less detrimental,"Long story short:

Husband is still on ex wife’s mortgage, although he did a quit claim deed when they divorced.  Ex was supposed to refinance within a year but she never did. Their divorce paperwork states she is fully financially responsible for the home which is what saved us when we were   purchasing our home. 

Ex is having financial difficulties paying her mortgage and got a call from the mortgage company to ask if hubby would agree to apply for a 3 month deferment on the mortgage.

 Would it be worse to sign and potentially have it reflect negatively on his credit as being unable to afford his bills (even tho he doesn’t pay toward that mortgage at all) OR does he not sign and let her fail and fall behind? 

For context-he didn’t bring up the topic of refinancing because he knew she wouldn’t qualify on her own and they used to share kids 50/50. Now we have full custody and they have a stable and safe home.  Also, she is in financial distress because she brought up a custody battle based on lies that the kids are being abused at our home by me and him. 🙄 We hired a lawyer and a Guardian Ad litem was appointed and those fees are close to 10K (each) so far…

She also has legal troubles with a felony case for keying a woman’s car over a parking spot so her lawyer bills are substantial.

My wife and I each have a Roth IRA, but since she is currently skilling up to start a new career and gets irregular paychecks, I contribute to both. I'm planning my last 1-2 contributions for 2024 and want to double-check my understanding of the limits. 

Questions:

401k limit for 2024 is $23,000. Am I correctly understanding that this only counts *my* elective deferrals, meaning if I contributed $15,000 from my salary so far (and employer has matched X), I can contribute $8,000 more?

Roth IRA limit for 2024 is $7,000. I've contributed $4,800 to both IRAs. Am I correctly understanding I can contribute $2,200 more to each?

Summing up the contributions, I could contribute a total of $8,000 (out of my salary) + $2,200 + $2,200. Is that right?

Finally, what are some things to consider as I plan for future contributions? I am thinking I'll make two more contributions to each account this year to meet the limits, which means taking home less pay from my job, and having a little less to spend through the end of the year (or just drawing from savings). Alternatively, is it ""better"" in principle to gradually increase my contributions (so, not meet the limits for this year), and then next year divide up the limit by 12 months and contribute regular amounts to meet the limits for 2025?

We are looking to buy a house here, and I am thinking that now is a good time to move my investments and USD to EUR. I was hoping for some advice. Also, general advice, as I see the USD is strong at the moment, buying 0.95€.

* liquid/checking/savings: $1k, I've already been using this
* Invesco: $33k
* HSA: $7k
* 401k: $19k
* IRA: $3k

Moving Invesco incurs no fees, so that is a simpler question of just ""will it grow even more in the next few months?"". I'm leaning towards no, and to just go ahead and transfer that over, as an investment in a larger down payment for a house seems like a wiser choice.

The other accounts are all small retirement accounts. I know I would be hit with fees for withdrawing from them, but part of me wants to just go ahead and pull the money out and rip the bandaid off. what is more valuable, that $7k right now toward a house, or that money as and HSA in 32 years?

We originally planned on one of us financing on our own (0% APR) to help build credit score since I can’t think of a single advantage of taking out a joint loan seeing that we are each highly qualified borrowers on our own. Both of our names would ideally be on the title.

personalfinance,"Approaching Roth IRA Income Limit, Should I lower MAGI and contribute or rollover","My Wife (34F) and I (32M) are about to reach the Roth IRA Income Limit and I am unsure what to do with my IRA. We have next to no debt outside of our Mortgage and are already making extra payments. She was recently offered a salary of $165,000, and with my salary of $80,000 we will be over the Roth IRA Income Limit next year if we don't lower our MAGI.

I have generally tried to help her with her finances but this one will be beyond my knowledge. She will be almost doubling her salary next year so its a very large increase in income for us. My plan was to get her to maximize yearly contribution to her Trad 401k to lower her taxable income. A few reasons for this, since her salary will be jumping so much she wont miss the money being invested, it will set her up for retirement, It might drop us a tax bracket and it will put us below the Roth IRA income limit.

Obviously if she doesn't want to contribute that much I'm not going to force her, and part of me feels like trying to force us to stay under the income limit seems like a losing battle in the long run. In an ideal scenario we will both get raises and promotions that will outpace the limit increase.

So I am asking to see if you all have some ideas, here are the main options I've thought of but would love to hear some other perspectives.

1. Wife increases Trad 401k to $23,500 next year, We are below limit, I continue to contribute the same to my Roth IRA and Roth 401k.
2. Wife contributes whatever she wants, I keep my Roth IRA but stop contributing because of limit, Double my Roth 401k contributions.

If you are wondering the Roth IRA is from before we were married, and I guess I just fall into the group of ""I'd rather just pay taxes now and just not think about it in the future""

||Me|Wife|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Salary|$80,000|$165,000|$245,000|
|Current 401K|$24,000 (Roth)|$26,000 (Trad)|$50,000|
|IRA|$11,000 (Roth)|$0|$11,000|

Any other tips, ideas, pit falls to look out for and general advice would be awesome thanks guys!

personalfinance,Thoughts on using VOO as a savings fund?,"Currently have $150,000 in it in a taxable and another $100,000 sidelined in a HYSA.
I'm considering dumping all but maybe $50,000 of the cash into VOO.

That $50,000 would be slightly under 1 year of emergency savings.

I have another $100,000 of equity in my house that i can use for a down payment on my next house if I choose to move, but I also like having that additional $50,000 sidelined in case a deal comes up quickly or the market goes down. I'm investing everything above the $100k though and add $50,000 plus per year to that fund. I've tried single stocks but am too emotional and like the S&P to keep me from making any irrational moves. 

I have also considered going down to around $25,000 in cash but for some reason $50-100k helps me to sleep easy at night. Just can't decide on the right amount of cash at this time, considering I don't know where l'll be in a few years and where my life will be",1732169260.0

Becoming homeless and being forced into survival mode was the best thing to happen to me. Life needed to get my attention, and I got to living.

Starting fall quarter 2025, I will transfer to a university and the apartment I plan to get with section 8 will be very close to the university. I’m waiting for the section 8 voucher orientation (was told it could take 6 months due to back log of clients), which is fine.

personalfinance,Starting over after divorce ,"Hi! I’m 37f, divorced mother of 1 (11) trying to figure out how to plan for the future. I was a SAHM for 9 years while married and I’ve been busting my ass starting over for the last 2 years. Ex bought me out of the mortgage and with that money I paid off my car and lived off the rest while paying for school and life expenses. Got a degree, got a job, and now I feel like I’m finally on level ground but I’m also feeling increasingly overwhelmed in a whole new way.



Here is where I am at currently: 

Take home into my checking account is 4400/month. 

I put 5% into a Roth 401k and 5% into a Traditional 401k (and get a 5% employer match in the traditional), plus I’ve started putting 15% into a HYSA that is my emergency fund. These all get deducted from my check respectively and are already factored out of the amount above. 

The only debt I have is 4.5k remaining from a medical procedure that’s on a credit card since I went a year without insurance 🫠 oops 

Monthly expenses are only about 3k (rent, utilities, food, gas, etc) but my ex is out of work so I’ve been shouldering a lot more of our kiddos needs, so recently closer to 3.2-3.5k. Still a bit of room left to save though, and I’m willing to go more lean if it means padding for the future.



These are my questions: 

\- Should I continue to split between a Roth and Trad 401k? In my mind Roth is a better choice but I’m not confident on if that’s actually true which is why I split them. 

\- Should I use my HYSA to pay off the debt then rebuild that emergency fund? I only have 7500 in the HYSA. 

\- Should I switch to 10% into a HYSA and max out a Roth IRA? Or add an HSA?



Short term goal is to buy a house in 2025, credit score is 812, but I’m mostly worried about my low income holding me back on this. So it might not be possible, I might need to wait until I break six figures if I’m being honest with myself. 

Long term the dream is ‘retire’ by 55, but this is wholly dependent on maximizing my earnings potential while saving simultaneously, and is less than 20 years away…

I was over the AGI to contribute to my Fidelity Roth IRA for 2023. I filed my 2023 taxes in April 2024.

My fidelity advisor said I will need to file a Return of Excess Contributions to withdraw the $6500 I contributed in 2023 and its earnings. She said this will be filed by Fidelity with the IRS as an early withdrawal based on my age. She then said I will have to retroactively amend my 2023 tax return,  file a 5329, and also file an 8606 to essentially tell the IRS that this wasn't an early withdrawal but a return of excess (to avoid the 10% penalty on top of my 6% penalty).

personalfinance,Which is better if you expect a lot of health issues. High premium or high deductible. ,"The math simply isn’t working out logically. 

There’s a strong possibility that I’ll have a lot of medical bills coming up. There’s also a possibility it could go pretty sideways medically. 

So I looked into a slightly better health plan with a lower deductible. But the premium, plus deductible, is actually more the max out of pocket cost of the high deductible plan. 

The only way this makes sense is if my whole family has a lot of health care expenses. That way at least one of them can enjoy an even lower deductible. 

But also, if it goes sideways, I’m going to have to come up with that max pretty early in the year.  Dragging it out with higher premiums feels like I’m paying a high interest loan on my health care that may or may not happen.

I (30m) have some credit card debt that I am looking to pay off as soon as possible.

* Card 1: $5,850 (27.49%)
* Card 2: $10,800 (15.74%)
* Card 3: $5,850 (21.74%)
* Card 4: $4,200 (27.49%)
* Card 5: $11,350 (0% APR expires in July 2025)
* Card 6: $19,600 (0% APR expires in April 2026)

I also have a student loan of $4,800 and a private loan from a family member of $80,000, both at 5%. The student loan payments are $60 a month, and the personal loan payments are $500 a month (although I would love to repay it faster).

I have a mortgage for a multi-unit house valued around $880,000 (according to Redfin), and I owe around $474,000. My mortgage is at 2.75%, 30 year fixed, and my monthly payment is around $3,300 (including taxes and insurance escrow).

My gross income from work is around $115,000 a year (plus a 7.5% target bonus), so I am getting around $2,700 every two weeks after deductions (8% for 401k contributions, insurance for me and my wife, and taxes). I am receiving $7,300 a month in rent payments.

I have to financially support my wife and my parents on this income. I can elaborate more as to why, but I would prefer to keep it outside of this discussion. We are working on getting a job for my wife, which should help our situation.

**Quick Summary**

Income:

* Work (net) $5,880
* Rent $7300

Expenses:

* Mortgage $3,300/month
* Rent $1020/month
* Utilities $400/month
* Food $1500/month
* Medical insurance for my father $1000/month
* Car insurance $170/month
* Gas $200/month
* Internet $80/month
* Cell phone (4 lines) $110/month

I have other expenses that vary from month to month. I am trying to be conscious about them, but it can be quite challenging, considering there are 3 other people I am paying for. Overall, I am estimating my total expenses be around $8,000 a month, on average.

I have a 401k with approximately $40,000 invested and no other significant savings.

Would a home equity loan be a good option for me? What amount do you think I could/should request and how big could the closing costs be? I am worried that my debt to income ratio could be too low. How would I go about estimating whether a home equity loan would be worth it over paying everything off one by one using the avalanche method? Are there any solutions I could be missing or are there any other questions that I should be asking?

personalfinance,Making a Financial Decision for a voluntary separation offer,"Throwaway for, well Throwaway reasons.

I'm looking for advice as to how to look at a financial decision I need to make:

I'm 59 (not yet 59 1/2), married, and been working my first post-college job for 37 years now.  Its in Tech, so I earn a good salary, plus bonus and RSUs

Last Friday I got an email announcing a voluntary separation program which I'm eligible for.  The offer is 40 weeks of pay, company pays most of COBRA for 18 months for health, vision and dental...and my unvested RSUs vest on a prorated basis.  That COBRA subsidy is worth another 10 weeks of pay, and assuming the 18-month low on company stock price, the prorated RSU vesting is worth almost 20 weeks of pay.

I had kinda earmarked being financially able to retire at age 60, but never committed to retiring at any particular age.  My 401k is half of our invested net worth, and it's 15x my salary...so all told we have 30x salary.  Wife has not worked for income since Clinton was president and feels her current medical condition makes it too difficult for her to work.  Assuming I accept the offer and don't find another job, we'd have to cover healthcare somehow for 50 months for myself and for 77 months for Wifey -- until medicare kicks in.

If I don't take the offer and I happen to be made redundant, my understanding is the severance pay cuts from 40 weeks to 26 weeks, the help with COBRA goes away, and unvested RSUs also go away.  I estimate the likelyhood of involuntary severance to be about 10%

Financially, I'm almost positive I can do this, but I'd like some thoughts on this.

It is an employee owned company that lets us buy stock at a 15% discount from the fair market price. When the price reaches around the low $30 mark they do a split. 

I looked at how often they do splits and it looks like roughly every 10 years. I get dividends at about $0.03 per share owned and I can keep all shares if I leave the company. 

With that said, not sure what the best thing to do is. I was between taking a loan and buying enough that a split or two would net me a nice retirement egg or just buying every week. 

Weekly I could comfortably buy a few shares, maybe like 5 at a price $20 without worrying about it.

personalfinance,"Whole life insurance, VUL policy or something else? ","Hi all,

Will try to be concise, when I was 20 I inherited a small amount of money from my moms passing. I knew nothing at all about finances then so under my dad’s pressuring we opened a whole life policy. I think at the time I invested somewhere around 15-20k maximum. Now, I’m nearly at the 20 year mark of the monthly payments so it’s almost at a point for it pays for itself but I am very concerned that about how low the returns are. It’s only guaranteed at 300k, which is a very low return given the amount of time. 

I spoke recently with the guy who handles the whole life policy , he says he’s a financial planner. He mentioned I could transfer tax free this 30k into a VUL type of insurance. The return rate averages about 10% so 20 years of regular contributions it looks like it would pay off quite nicely and it’s not taxed when it’s withdrawn. 

Also very important to note - I’m a U.S. citizen living and working for a European company in Europe. So due to the fact I don’t have a U.S. company or 1040 etc many other types of investing funds and tax advantage funds like an IRA, Roth IRA or 401k are not accessible to me. I’m also blocked from a lot of financial investments and funds where I live because I’m a U.S. person and banks / financial institutions don’t want the hassle of double declaring us to the IRS.

Any input or advice? Anyone try a VUL?

personalfinance,401k or Roth 401k? High but variable income ,"I am new (and late) to thinking of financial planning and taking personal finance seriously. I enrolled into my company 401k plan 5 1/2 years ago and haven't really thought much about it until now. 

My company matches up to 3% and offers a 401k and Roth 401k option. I have personal savings but aside from this 401k I have no other retirement or investment accounts. I put 13% of my income into the 401k and my company matches 3%. I have a value of about $143k in there now, all invested in a target date fund 2060 (automated, I just learned what this what) I am an account executive and being in sales my income can fluctuate but either way I still earn a decent salary. 75k base and OTE is 216k although I don't always hit that. 

2022 income- 130k (bad year) 
2023 income- 202k 
2024- likely to hit around 175/180k 

My question are.. what would be the best strategy for me given what I already have in place and my variable income? Should I keep the 401k or switch to Roth 401k? My company will match either.

I got married this year and was unaware of the income limits for Roth IRA. We also have a FIL stay with us. Does his income figure in to our MAGI number?

Just with the two of us, our combined income puts us relatively close but I don’t know how close. I can’t find a very clear cut way to calculate MAGI. I’ve almost maxed out my IRA for the year already. How and when would I even find out if I was in violation? 

If I am able to somehow find out how to calculate the MAGI number and we are over the limit, am I able to fix it somehow before I get penalized?

personalfinance,Trying to decide which ACA insurance plan makes the most sense for me - A cheaper HDHP that isn't HSA eligible or a more expensive one that is?,"I am a mix of part-time and self employed, and have been able to take advantage of the ACA for years. A couple years ago I got turned on to an HSA as really more of an investment tool, so for the last two years I've had a HDHP that was HSA eligible through Blue Cross Blue Shield and have been making small monthly contributions to it.

Unfortunately, for next year there is literally only one HSA eligible plan, and it's not with BCBS but with Aetna. I don't like the idea of switching to a different provider, but it appears I don't have a choice if I want to keep contributing to my HSA. Here are things by the numbers:

My alloted tax credit is $434.

The price of a HDHP with BSBS is $351 per month with $7000 deductible.

The price of the HSA eligible Aetna plan is $428.57 with $5695 deductible.

I contribute roughly $60-$80 a month to my HSA. I have about $1200 in it currently and if I get it to $2000 I can invest it.

My tax credit would cover either plan, but I like to still pay a handful of dollars out of pocket. So by sticking to BCBS I could save close to $100 each month that I would get back as a refundable tax credit, versus like $100 for the whole year.

My question is, would it make more financial sense to stick with BCBS for next year and just not worry about my HSA? Should I dump enough money into my HSA to get it over $2000 before the year is out so it can be invested?",1732136388.0

personalfinance,Just moved to the US. Help me decide between VT & VTI/VXUS for my long term investing. How much will I forego by picking VT?,"

Hello,

I’m 36 and currently relocated to Texas.

So I was in Canada for the past 10 years and had most of my money (~$100k) invested in a Canadian TFSA (tax free savings account) in a 2-fund portfolio of VT & BNDW (90:10).

I liquidated my TFSA and moved permanently to the US last month since I got my greencard, and these funds are now lying around in my US bank account that I need to invest immediately into my newly opened taxable brokerage (Fidelity).

Since I prefer simplicity, I was thinking of just doing 100% VT again (ditching bonds this time as many people said you don’t need bonds at this age) despite the slightly higher ER and lack of tax credits, but since I expect this amount to grow, I’m wondering if it’s still a good idea? How much money in tax credits will I be foregoing every year by doing this?

Also - a lot of people prefer overweighting US and doing 80% VTI & 20% VXUS, and I’ve personally been seeing VTI consistently outperforming VT, so I’m wondering if it’s better to go this route instead and simply allocate every new investment in a 80/20 ratio? 

What do you guys suggest? 

P.S. I don’t have an IRA/401k as of now since I don’t have a job, so this question is just geared for my taxable brokerage account.",1732132456.0

personalfinance,"Question on choosing health insurance, not familiar with the US system so looking for some advice in regards to cost and whats actually worth it.","Hello guys,

so recently i got a new job - and have options on choosing my healthcare, so i am trying to budget and decide which is best and wanted some advice on my thought process.

So - im coming from a job where my insurance was garbage, no option. Just one plan (small company so im guessing insurance companies didnt really care about having them as a customer).

I am not too familiar with the US insurance system so its all very confusing for me.  

Now my insurance offers 3 plans.

The HDHP - costs me $0:     
$4k deductible,   
$4k out of pocket  
Cosinurance is 100% - so basically i pay everything until i meet my $4k deductible, but then i pay nothing. 

They have a PPO which is $55 per month, this is their highest tier:  

$1.2k deductible,     
out of pocket $4.2k    
Coinsurance is 20% after meeting my deductible      
Appointments are 20% paid by me.   
prescriptions are $15 copay with a $50 deductible     

Consumer Choice Plan CCP is $37 per month which is the middle option:    

deductible $3.2k,       
Coinsurance is 20% after meeting my deductible    
out of pocket 4.7k   
My company will contribute $600 per year into my HSA   
Appointments are 20% paid by me.      
 prescriptions:  20% after deductible      
   
So here is my logic:

Now, on the one hand - i have been a pretty healthy although im now getting older (basically 40s now). I had a ruptured disc a few years ago, and lets just say i can feel my body getting older. 

For the longest time if i had options i would go on the HDHP, and i would just save the money for a rainy day.

However, this is the first time the top tier insurance policy has been relatively cheap (its 672 for the year, but as its pre-tax the actual cost according to my calculations would be 465. Because the -660 spent on medical insurance would slightly lower my taxable income. 

$465 per year equates to $39 per month. 

Which in the grand scheme of things im thinking is pretty good to have peace of mind that routine visits are covered, prescriptions have higher coverage etc. 

 Many times over the years i have resisted going to the doctors because i am paying 100% until my deductible is met. 

The CCP is $444 per year, but after taxes have been taken into account it would cost me $312 per year (26 per month). 


So i guess in a nutshell:

1) Go with HDHP and save $465 per year and save more money to account for emergencies?   

2) Go with PPO and get the best coverage and be a little safer, and spend $465 per year for coverage.   

3) Middle of the road option, CCP, spend $312 per year, but get $600 back from my employer into an HSA for medical expenses. Net gain of $288 per year.

personalfinance,Is there I can do about a potentially unethical 401k setup?,"**Most 401Ks I've Seen:**

* They offer at least 1 low expense ratio fund/index
* They are fairly easy to roll over into a 401k or IRA

**Prior Employer's Ascensus 401k:**

It only offers high expense ratio funds and it's very hard to roll over:

* Requesting a rollover first requires the participant to set up a notary appointment to notarize the rollover agreement (with an additional witness who also needs to take off work).
* That notarized document must be faxed to Ascensus (they only accept fax) - there no way to verify they received it since all requests go to one number & you receive no confirmation from them.
* My experience (and the experience of a friend who also tried to roll it over but gave up) has been sending the fax multiple times and being told multiple times they don't see it on their side.
* If you are lucky and they process it (which takes a few weeks), you will be given a short window to make the rollover happen due to an Ascensus policy that the notary agreement only unlocks the rollover option for a short window.
* You are not notified when it is processed, so you need to be checking your 401k portal frequently to see if they did it or not to not miss your rollover request window.
* Once processed you can request a check be mailed to you (unlike many 401k providers there is no option to do this online, it must be mailed via check).
* However if you moved you need update your address which by policy locks your account for weeks
* The locking of your account means your notary letter is no longer valid due to the above policy where the letter is only valid for rollovers for a short while
* So you need to restart with faxing a new notarized agreement
* Also at any point if you call and you don't the exact date you were hired off hand they lock your account for weeks as that is one of the (automated) verification questions.

**Why this may be unethical:**

They make a killing on your money sitting in high expense ratio funds (they do not offer low expense funds), so they have a financial stake in setting up a system that intentionally makes that money hard to roll over.",1732127479.0

personalfinance,Stuck with a car that I owe more than what its worth.,"for starters, I am completely aware that this was a poor financial decision on my part so please spare me the life lessons haha.

Buckle up, its a long one.

  
I purchased a 2016 ford focus from a ""buy here pay here"" dealer back in 2022. the car i was trading in had taken a dump and i worked in 2 hours that day so i was in a rush to leave with a car off the lot as quick as possible. I didn't fully look over every part of every document, and when the words ""salvaged title"" were brought up, I had no idea what it meant. I willingly signed  for this car with $1045 down. 

  
I left the lot and immediately got a ""oil change requested"" notif on my dash, but ignored it because again, I had to work in 2 hours. The first few weeks were great, no problems whatsoever. I took it to get regularly serviced, tires rotated, all that good stuff. 

  
Then, maybe about 8 months or so later, my driver side strut needed to be replaced as well as some ither suspension components. They took care of it but kept my car overnight, and when i picked it up I noticed the entire interior of my car was COVERED in dirt, like if a sand storm rolled in and the windows were down. So I went back in there and complained and they informed me that they are not responsible for anything that happens to a vehicle while its on their lot. I expressed to them that they should have kept the windows up because its in a bad part of town and there are stray animals as well. They reassured me it wouldn't happen again.

  
A few months go by, maybe 2, and my transmission goes out completely. I'm stuck on the service road of the highway and had to get the car towed back to the dealer so they could fix it for me. They told me that it was under warranty and that I didn't have to pay anything, but that my transmission went out because there was no fluid. But mind you, about 3 weeks prior to that I had brought it in to get the fluids checked and topped off so there's no way it would've been bone dry if they just filled it up with trans fluid and there wasn't a leak either. So they lied about either topping off my fluid, or it went out for another reason. Regardless, they fix it. I go to get my car when its done and sure enough, they left the windows down again and there are cat paw prints EVERYWHERE and my car smelled like cat piss. of course i take pictures, walk my ass back in there and complain all over again and they tell me the same thing as before. 

  
7 months later, my transmission goes out again. This time I'm furious because there's no reason i should be purchasing another transmission this soon. I bring it back to them, and they keep it for a few days and I'm thinking they're working on it the whole time, come to find out they were waiting for an estimate because THIS time, they wanted me to pay $2500 for them to replace it. I go back and forth with the service manager and she keeps telling me ""well how about we split it half and half"" I'm not covering half at ALL because they put a USED faulty transmission in when they didn't give me the option to purchase a new one. So she declines. I then report them to the BBB because I felt i had been sold a lemon. The service manager agrees to replace the transmission free of charge, but get this, she BANS ME from bringing it back to get serviced there. So i ignore it, it it what it is. 

  
I leave with my car, and later that night I'm driving somewhere and my car starts SMOKING like crazy. I pull over. pop the hood and see that there is oil everywhere. I turned the car back on to see where its coming from, and its spitting oil from the valve cover so i immediately knew it was the valve cover gasket. I manage to get it home and I'm replacing it the next day and i find that someone took one of the gasket pieces off and shoved it into a part of my engine bay. it seemed absolutely intentional. after being banned because i reported them to the BBB, this happens? its not a coincidence. so i fix it myself and i leave it alone.

According to AZ state guidelines, my car doesn't fall under the lemon law therefore nobody will take my case. One attorney informed me of an arbitration procedure that happened against Ford in 2020, with the exact transmission i have. Same symptoms and everything. So i spend about a month and a half of my time going through the full procedure so that i can do a buyback from Ford. I submit every single service order for the transmission, I provide everything they need. And after the interview with the arbitrator, they deny me because Ford only has record of me replacing the trans ONCE. Not twice. So either they didnt report it, or they didnt fully replace it I have no idea. Regardless, i am still stuck with this car.

  
Now, i currently owe about $4,700 left on this $20,000 loan, and I've been looking around trying to get someone to let me trade it in because its not worth it at all. It has a salvaged title, so my MAX offers have been around $1500 at the most which isn't enough to buy me out of the loan. Yesterday, I completed a credit app and was informed that this 20k auto loan isn't reflecting on all credit bureaus so essentially its not positively affecting me whatsoever. But if it gets repoed, THEN that will show up on my credit but all this progress I've been making has really been for nothing.

personalfinance,Can we afford to move?,"Hi- turning to Reddit to help solve an argument (that’s always good, right?🤦‍♀️). Can we afford to move? I don’t have all the exact numbers so I’m going to overestimate expenses and underestimate income.

My husband and I are in our 30s. We own a 3 bed/2 bath house and that worked when we had 1 child but now we have 3 and I want to move to a larger house. We don’t have a very expensive lifestyle and we definitely avoid debt. We have just over $18,000 left to pay off on our house. The Zillow estimate for our house is $350,000. Not sure about the accuracy of Zillow estimates, but that’s the number. We have no other debt. All of our vehicles are paid off. We have credit cards, but we treat them as debit cards and never carry a balance.

As far as income, he is the primary income. His pre-tax base pay is $125,000 but he has the option of working overtime and he does sometimes and he gets a yearly performance bonus. My income is more variable. I work part time on weekends so we don’t have to pay for childcare. I had a baby this year so I didn’t work for 3 months but I’m on track to bring in $16,050. We fully contribute to retirement, we have 529 plans for each of our kids, and we have savings.

As an example, I’m looking at new construction that’s $560,000. If we can net $300,000 from our current house and use that as a down payment, a mortgage calculator shows me that at 6.77% our monthly payment would be less than $2,200. This current builder is advertising lower rates if we finance through them and when I plug that in, it shows an estimated monthly payment of $1,873/month. 

Can we afford this? If I bring this up, my husband looks at me like I’m crazy. He says I have no idea how expensive it is to move on top of “doubling” what we pay now (our current mortgage payment is $1,200 which I think is really reasonable). It’s true, this is our first house so I have never gone through the process of selling a house. Am I being unreasonable thinking we could afford to do something like this?

But we also need some home repairs and she thought it was a good idea to look into refinancing and that’s when I ran across Helocs as an option only because my rate currently is at 3% and don’t want to lose it.

personalfinance,How much should I aim to have to early retire and be able to live comfortably?,"I'm not looking to live extravagantly.  I have a lot of assets and a bit of debt.  I'm wondering if we could simply sell off some things and stop working and still be able to get by.

We're 38 and have two children (2 and 4).  They're likely to be our biggest money sink, but we don't need to save for their college or anything like that.  Just typical costs associated with raising them.

We currently own some land, worth about $90,000.  It has some food trucks that rent from us.  I might be willing to keep this since the time commitment is minimal.  We spend about $500/mo on utilities and bring in about $1,400/mo in rent.

We have our house, which is maybe worth $320,000 and includes a retail space attached.  Currently we're running a coffee shop out of it ourselves but that's a nuisance.  We break even and maybe make a little money off of it, but it takes a lot of our time to manage.  If we closed it up, we might be able to rent the space for $800 to $1200 per month.  The house and this retail space is worth about $320,000 but we have about $150,000 left on the mortgage.  The rates are whatever current rates are, so they change.  Recently went up to like 6% but I think dropped a little recently.

We also have a $36,000 car we bought in 2021.  Not sure how much is left on the loan there but the APR is fixed 2.9%.  

We have about $300,000 in stocks, $200,000 in crypto and maybe $70,000 in stocks via IRAs.

My wife works, and I do freelance work and manage the business some.  Our goal would be to get away from working as soon as we can, though I might still freelance occasionally which would maybe be about $12,000/year since I wouldn't want to do it full time.

personalfinance,Does it make sense to move in this scenario?,"
My partner and I live in Tampa (a M/HCOL area) in a 3/2 single-family home we rent for $1740/month base rent, around $2050 with utilities. Our landlord raised our renewal rate to $2000 base/$2300 with utilities, but when we said we wouldn’t renew, they dropped it back down to $1700 base rent. We have a deadline to decide whether to sign the renewal.  

We found a new rental, a 2/1 that’s half the space but significantly cheaper: $1300/month or $1400/month with January rent free. The issue is the new lease starts December 15th, and they won’t push back the start date. They also require first month’s rent, a security deposit, and a pet fee upfront—$3000 total.  

Our current lease ends January 28th, and since we paid first/last/security when we moved in, January would technically be free, but we’d still owe full rent for December. With no savings, paying rent on both places for December isn’t feasible.  

The new rental would save us $700+ a month, which is huge, and other 2/1 rentals in the area cost much more. However, we’d need to downsize quickly, and our current 3/2 is a great deal for the location.  

For context:
- I net $4000/month and gross $75,000/year.
- My partner makes $3700/month base but earns overtime regularly.  He makes around $50,000 a year.
- We hope to save for a house within a year or so.

Posted here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfree/comments/1gvtn1n/debt\_resolution\_and\_employee\_espp\_plan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfree/comments/1gvtn1n/debt_resolution_and_employee_espp_plan/)

But looking for perspectives in different communities.

Hoping this is the right sub to ask...

Somewhat interesting question. Never posted here, and posting on a second account. I'm currently 50k in debt, with all the loans, credit cards that I've cumulated over the years. We bought a house, and the house had undisclosed issues that needed a few loans to take on, and I'm taking on all these loans myself.

I have a house, and a car, so I really have no need for any major financial purchases in the next couple years. And if I make a major purchase, I want to be in a position to just pay most of it off with cash if not the entire amount.

I work for a company that has a very good Employee Stock Purchasing plan, that has a 2 year look back period, and has been doing very well. Buying a stock would be roughly $105 for me, in which selling at roughly 400. Every 6 months the employer takes the money I put into it, buys all my stock at the discount and then I can sell right away. This looks like essentially a 3x-4x my money minus taxes.

With the combination of me wanting to get out of debt, not really caring about credit purchases, and the ESPP plan, I've been thinking about holding off on making payments to my debters an focusing those payments 100% on the ESPP plan. I'm already doing 5% of my check, but I can't do more because I'm paying into my debts. The plan is to instead invest that money into the ESPP to which I can sell 3-4x in 6 months, then just come in with one fell swoop and pay everyone off. To put into perspective I pay roughly $1500 a month in payments just to debt alone. I'd continue to pay on my mortgage, and my car note, but aside from that I could be looking at $2000 a month into ESPP. payments, including what I currently contribute now. This would be roughly 30-40k in optimistic income in which I get other financial insentives vested to pay the rest off.

This would destroy my credit. But I truly don't need any major purchases at the moment. I need either some advice, different perspectives. This seems like a 'too good to be true' situation.

Own a home w/ mortgage at 3%, no other debt. Net worth around $500k (roughly 100k house equity, 400k from cash and retirement) 

So, with $3k in excess of our monthly expenses/wants plus our net worth, I feel like, on paper, I kind of have my “pick of the litter,” in terms of what to go for without sabotaging our future selves. However, also don’t want to do something I’d come to regret. I’m looking mostly at used/new Honda/acura/lexus (not a fan of current gen Toyotas). 

I like the savings of a used car but better rates, warranty, first owner entices me to spend extra on new. And another extension of that, I heavily appreciate quality, so that’s why Lexus/acura are in consideration even with their further higher price. 

Currently looking at used/new Honda passports/pilots, Lexus RX, Acura MDX 

Maybe I need a reality check, but is there an obviously wrong choice here if I plan to keep the car for a decade or longer? Thank you guys for the help! ",1732120173.0
personalfinance,Thoughts on portfolio consolidation ,"Wanted to get people's thoughts on consolidating my portfolio. 

Looking at my Robinhood portfolio, I have 5.79 shares of Microsoft and 7 shares of Apple that I've had for years. Haven't regularly contributed to them. Just collecting and reinvesting the dividends. 

I've moved more to mostly focusing on index funds. With that, does it make sense to sell my stakes in Apple and Microsoft and consolidate with my SCHD holdings for greater dividends? My logic is that I'm going to see a bigger snowball consolidated in SCHD than the gains and dividends that I'd see individually in Microsoft and Apple.

Complete Credit Card and Personal Finance newbie here. I’m working on getting my finances in order after making some less-than-ideal decisions in the past and would love some advice.

personalfinance,Anyone have suggestions for my predicament?,"Okay. So after this year when I file taxes in the spring, I will owe the government (between the IRS, WI state and OH state) upwards of $20,000 for doing 1099 work between last year and this year. Maybe closer to $30,000 (I'll have to see when I file for sure the amount). I'm not gonna go into detail on the reasons I wasn't able to save for my taxes because it's a long list of bullshit (but not *really* bs lol). Just know I have tried to save for them for the time I've done 1099 work knowing full well I'll have to pay my own. I just lost my 2nd 1099 job for reasons out of my control and am probably not gonna do anymore 1099 if I can avoid it so I don't dig myself into deeper debt, because I obviously haven't been able to take care of the tax part and *also* just feel like I don't know enough about deductions and what not to be able to file well for the max amount of money to be saved from Uncle Sam's nasty clutches. That, and I really want the W-2 benefits since it's been far too long since I've been to the doctor, dentist, etc. I'll make less money, but at least I'll be in my home town again near my family and girlfriend of 5 yrs nearly. 

Currently, I'm sitting at $340/mo tax payments for 2023 taxes between WI state and IRS tax. I can reasonably assume the payments for 2024 are going to be a similar amount tacked on in the spring unless there's a way to renegotiate the payments to include both years into one.

My question: Is there any way to lower my monthly tax payments or is there a tax debt forgiveness program or something? Not even sure if this is possible or if I'll just be a slave to the government for numerous years until my debt is paid... but yeah. My credit currently isn't great and is in the 600-625 range (not sure if that matters).

This tax thing is going to be my biggest expense monthly other than rent and I would really like to have the extra money to pay off credit cards, my truck, and also just be able to save more for various different things (ya know... like fun family events, vacations, EMERGENCIES....or **retirment** **LMAO**).

personalfinance,Long Commute w/ no rent?,"I (23M) currently live \~24 miles away from my workplace and have 40-50 minute commute. Rent is about \~$1700. Due to some things outside my control I'm going to be moving by the end of the month. I can choose to either:

\- Live 8 miles away (20 min commute) from work with one of my coworkers for $1450 per month + utilities.

\- Live at home with my parents 28 miles away from work and pay close to nothing in rent, just helping out with a few bills/groceries. The commute cuts across LA so it's significantly longer. Luckily my manager allowed me to come a little later (\~10 AM) to arrive when traffic isn't *as* bad. This would make the commute 45-50 min.

I'm conflicted since the first option seems very cheap for LA rent. At the end of the day though, I could be living at home doing virtually the ""same"" drive and saving over $1700 on rent + other hidden costs like groceries, etc. Gas would be tough, but luckily I drive an EV and can charge at home or work for relatively cheap. I feel like it's coming down to preference at this point. I already drive home \~25 miles almost every other weekend to see friends and family, this would cut that drive out at least. 

I know my current situation is way worse than both of these options, but I'm curious if there's any other costs or considerations I'm missing. In my culture it's pretty normal to live with your parents until you're married. Luckily, my parents and I have a very good relationship and they place essentially 0 limitations on me so ""freedom"" isn't a concern here either.

So let's say I have 3 large PayPal credit purchases, all of which are 0% interest if payed off within 6 months. 

Purchase 1: $20 / 1 month left to pay.

Purchase 2: $300 / 3 months left to pay.

Purchase 3: $1500 / 6 months left to pay.

Typically my payment for the next month would be the sum of all payments divided by the months to pay left.

Purchase 1: $20/1 = $20.00 +

Purchase 2: $300/3 = $100.00 +

Purchase 3: $1500/6 = $250.00

**Total payment this month = $370.00**

I have read the wiki regarding the differences between Roth and Traditional and normally I feel like a smart person but this makes me feel dumb. Should I contribute max to a Roth right now and then when my income increases contribute to traditional? I started reading about backdoor and got even more confused.

He also got a $10k inheritance that we've finally gotten the payment for. The initial plan was to also put it into the 529. Based on various 529 calculators, the 529 would provide enough to pay for about half of his college at a state school.

personalfinance,Is HSA a better deal?,"I am turning 26 later this week, and recently just had  my first child, with my wife going part-time as a nurse to stay home with the baby. As a result, I will need to sign up for some form of family health insurance during my open enrollment, which is currently going on now. I am considering either normal PPO or HSA, and kind of leaning towards HSA. Details are as follows:

PPO:
Premium: $487.28 (we get paid 2x a month)
Deductible: $0 if using Mercy network, which we use for all doctors and hospitals when possible. 20% coinsurance on hospital services and $10-$25 copay on different types of physician visits, free preventative care

HSA:
Premium: $369.99
Deductible: $3,300 family, $1,650 individual (will explain importance later), then 0% coinsurance after deductible is met (only medication copays would apply, which are the same on either plan). 
Free preventative care or teladoc

My work contributes $1,000 in seed money and matches the first $500 I contribute. So my thoughts are, if I choose HSA and contribute the difference between the 2 premium options, I would be putting in $2,815 into the HSA, + the $1500 from my work, would result in $4300, enough to pay up to the deductible and have some left over. 

Additionally, my wife is a type 1 diabetic. The individual deductible is important because once that  is satisfied by any individual on the plan, the plan begins covering all their expenses. So with her Continuous glucose monitor + pump + related supplies + insulin, she would hit the individual deductible pretty early into the year. 

My question is, am I overlooking anything that I should consider into making my decision? And also, if I pay the same amount each month (by contributing the difference into the HSA), is there any additional tax savings? Since PPO premiums are pretax as well?

But it doesn't look like there is much I can do to offset the 30k interest I come. Maybe next year I have it put into an llc so I only pay 21% on it?

Paying about 11k on that 30k of interest income is a tough pill to swallow ... how do we combat that?",1732110522.0
personalfinance,Open a Roth before or after paying off debt and having 6 months saved?,"I earn about 65K as a state employee and am only contributing 5.5% to retirement. Employer match is 6.25%. With my current expenses, I don’t see how I could make the maximum contribution every year so my thinking is I should open a Roth (tax free withdrawals sounds like a great benefit to me). 

My only debt is a car loan (36 months at 5.99%) and I’m already 4 months ahead. I expect to have it paid next December. I currently have 4 months of expenses in my HYSA. 

My plan: Pay off my car loan AND have a minimum of 6 months saved before I open a Roth. I want to also open a non-retirement brokerage account (maybe for down payment on a house?). I’d redirect my car payment funds to the brokerage accounts. My main angst is I won’t be able to do this until 2026! 

A part of me is screaming that TIME is ticking and I can open something now and make smaller contributions instead of waiting. But then the part of me that wants to be rid of debt is saying I could use that money to pay it off even sooner.

What are your thoughts on this strategy? I’m open to other ideas I may not have considered.",1732110396.0
personalfinance,Advice on using trust fund money,"Not sure if I’ll get answers to all my questions here, but hoping I can gain a little insight.

I had an injury at birth due to medical negligence. My parents sued the doctor and settled out of court. So far I’ve received 4 annual payments of $40,000 each that started when I was 18. This money was primarily used to pay for my college tuition, and I feel *extremely* lucky to not have student loans like the majority of people I know do. Judging by how much my tuition was, I’d conservatively estimate that there’s about $50,000 left in my account. The next payments are set to begin when I turn 25. I’ll be getting 4 payments of approximately $250,000 every 5 years until I turn 40. I’m just curious as to how I should use the money as it comes along. I’m already investing in a Roth, though that has been exclusively with my own money from working. I’m definitely planning to use the first $250k payment to put a down payment on a house, but beyond that I’m honestly sort of lost. As of now, I’m thinking some more investment accounts, real estate (either as a rental or personal vacation home use, or both) and obviously regular savings.

The money was set up by the attorney to be held in and paid out from a Supplemental/Special Needs Trust managed by my parents. I’ve heard the main advantage of this type of trust is that it enables the beneficiary to still continue to collect government benefits, provided you spend the money on a very strict list of necessities. I collect no benefits, so I *assume* that I can really spend the money on anything I want/need since I’m not being audited/monitored for benefit eligibility. Obviously I still plan to use it responsibility, but am I correct in this assumption?

In 2013 I purchased a home with cash with my sales commission savings.   Could not get a loan obv without a w2, and while I understand the benefits of leverage, because it was a cash deal, this property provides me with $3k/month in passive income now which also works out to roughly a 12-16% guaranteed rate of return on the initial investment not even counting appreciation,  depending how you want to calculate the numbers (including/excluding property tax, insurance,  remodeling costs etc)

Have no desire to sell the property which is my primary/only source of income. 

Anyways,  in 15 years I can access my 401k/Roth which hovers around $1M.  I have a retail account roughly of $100k  that I sell off whenever I have cost over runs on my cc bill (which has been a lot lately) but effectively everything thing I sell off is not only present value but also the opportunity cost to compound.

So it's a balancing act.

personalfinance,"What’s my best route to $0 debt (401k withdrawl, 401k loan, personal loan, sell car etc)?","Hi all,

Long time reader, first time poster. I'll give the stats below and see if there are any suggestions from the forum. Bottom line is I am in pretty deep with debt, but the good news is I just got a new job with about a 40% pay raise. I just want to hopefully optimize getting out of debt, reduce interest, etc.

Income:

* $150k/yr pre tax
* $7100 per month post tax, 401k, brokerage investment etc.
* I put about $350 per month into my current 401k and $600 into my brokerage

Debt / Open Credit:

* $20,000 balance / $21,000 limit Personal Capital One Venture - Interest is \~$300/month at 17.75%
* $18,000 balance / $19,000 limit Personal BofA - Zero interest until 4/2024, then 15.7% after
* $0 balance / $25,000 limit Personal Capital One VentureOne
* $0 balance / $21,000 limit Personal Chase
* $0 balance Amex - shared with partner for shared daily expenses

Expenses:

* $2,250 / month rent
* $2,500 - $3,000 / month each shared expenses with partner
* $1,000 / month non-shared personal expenses

Assets:

* $83,000 - $88,000 in my 401k from last job (left about 2 months ago, so will likely convert it to an IRA soon)
* $2k current 401k
* $1.5k post-tax brokerage
* Car worth \~$6,000, paid off - GF has a car too

Other:

* Credit rating is right around 700
* Biggest thing bringing it down right now is I'm hovering right around 30% credit usage, and I think a tick over that which has brought it below 700 (698)
* Capital One offered 12 months at 0% APR on my ventureOne account for balance transfers 

My debt ultimately started with the memestonk debacle back in 2021, margin call, etc etc. My investing now is simply buying shares of market ETFs and I learned my lesson there.

I used to make about around $80k in 2020 / 2021, then $100-$105k a year for the last few years before I got my new job in September for a pay bump up to $150k. Unfortunately, I joined a startup and to be honest the future of the company is rather up in the air. Which comes up in my options below. The new company is ending their 401k match at EOY.

I keep track of all of my expenses from my shared and personal credit card on an excel document, so I have a good sense of where the money is going by category each month. We don't eat out more than a couple times a month, and I think we're done with travel until about April or so. I try to be frugal wherever possible but I also don't want to have this ruin my life and turn to living like I used to during college etc.

So, I think my options are:

1. Withdraw enough from my 401k/IRA to cover my credit card debt - which I think is the lowest stress option for me now and gives me a fresh start to contribute a lot to my IRA/401k down the line. Yes, I will take a big hit on my retirement savings but I am now earning a lot more and would be able to contribute more monthly with my debt being gone.

2. Roll my old 401k into my current 401k, and take a loan out on it to pay off my CC debt at a 9% interest rate - the problem here is if the company goes under, or gets acquired, or if I get fired, that amount is due within 90 days, or I have to then pay the tax penalties as if I just withdrew it.

3. Debt consolidation loan - I've been getting far too many emails and calls harassing me after trying to look for a loan here. General specs would be $1,800 a month for 2 years (14.7%), $1,300 a month for 3 years (15.3%, $1,000 for 4 years (16.2%). The other APRs don't seem to make sense given where my current balance APR is at. I'm leaning away from doing the 2 year because that is a huge monthly payment. The 3 or 4 year payments seem more palatable given my expenses but still very unsure about this option.

4. Sell my car to put a big dent in the capital one balance, then try to control spending and pay down the Capital One balance first, but in April I'll start getting interest charged on the BofA balance, and will need to strategize after that. Capital One has offered a year of 0% on balance transfers, and I'm seeing how long that will last before transferring my BofA balance there.

5. I suppose I could also zero out my 401k contributions, zero out brokerage contributions and pay it down that way, but I’m eating interest payments. 

Are there other options I should be considering?

Should I just take the risk to take the 401k loan out, and do a big enough loan to keep enough to cover the taxes in my brokerage etc if something bad does happen with my job and I have to pay the penalties? I could take a \~$45k loan from my 401k, pay off my two balances and then stash the rest in my post-tax brokerage account in something stable, just in case I have to pay off the taxes and penalty if I get fired / the company goes under.

Part of me feels confident in making enough money in the future where I want to just take the taxes and penalties from taking out enough from my 401k, just to wipe everything out and have my mind at ease. No credit hit either.

I appreciate any input and help! ",1732081098.0

personalfinance,Laid off: What to do with 401k?,"My wife was laid off and we don't know what to do about her 401k?

**BACKGROUND:**  

We're in our mid/late 50's and we were hoping she'd be able to retire in 2-3 years (I'll keep working for another 10 years or so).  Obviously with her income going from pretty decent to zero puts a wrinkle in the plans as we just don't have enough saved and living solely off my income will be tight but possibly doable (I'm self employed, so I don't have a 401k or pension).

Besides the modest size 401k, we both have an IRA that we opened 3 years ago (1 is pre-tax, one is post-tax = because we had no clue what we were doing).  The IRAs have preformed amazingly well, but even so, the total dollar amount isn't huge (the contribution's were capped, and there has only been 3 years of contributions, though at our ages I think we put in a little more than someone younger could have).

We have a pretty low COL and aren't material/money driven (which is good in that we don't need a ton of money to live on, but bad in that we don't have a ton saved up either).  With our ""retirement funds"" (401k + IRAs + Savings) I estimate that we currently have about half of what we need to get by on in retirement.  

Our plan had been for both of us to continue working and to continue to max 401k and IRA contributions for 2-3 more years (at which point we'd hoped to have our house paid off and our kids be financially self sufficient).  Then she'd retire and we'd live off my income for another 7-8 years until we both hit 65, with the hope/thinking that that money saved would grow some over those years without us having to put more into it (thus giving us a much more comfortable retirement, especially if it came close to doubling over those years).  But now with her income zero, it changes things. 

I'll also note that at her age she doesn't want (nor does she think she can get) a corporate job like she had, and ideally would like a fairly ""low stakes"" position (part time would be ideal to try out partial retirement, but we may need her to work full time just to gain access to healthcare) and thus likely she will be making about half of what she used to.  Month to month that should be OK (assuming Obamacare isn't too expensive if she doesn't get a full time job) but it will limit (to zero?) how much we can support the kids and likely we won't be able to add any to our retirement funds.

**QUESTIONS:**

1. Do we leave the 401k where it's at (and I assume pay the company some sort of management fee)?
2. Do we move it to one of our IRAs?  And if so, do we have a choice of which one?  (I think hers is the post-tax one but I'd have to double check)
3. If we have a choice, is Fidelity or Charles Schwab a better choice?  (my IRA is at Fidelity, hers is at Schwab)
4. For years we've maintained keeping 6 months of living money in a savings account (with crap yield, but it's our safety net/emergency fund).  With the upcoming year and all the unknowns, we're unsure if digging into that to make IRA contributions is something we're comfortable with, so likely won't contribute anything.  Is that dumb?  Our kids are both fairly recent college grads with low paying jobs and we still help them financially a decent amount.  1 lives in a MCOL area and is pretty close to being able to live off her own income, but the other is on the East coast in a HCOL area and she doesn't make much more than minimum wage (plus she's applying to grad schools, so her expenses may go way up while her income goes down some).
5. Sort of related:  At what age do parents stop helping their children financially?  Neither of our parents helped us at all past 18, but we're trying to help our kids avoid the struggles we went through.  Our plan has always been to help as much as we can (which was a decent amount) up until they're 26 (and forced off our health insurance, which seemed like a good age to plant the flag at).  We don't want them stressing about our finances, nor do we want them to get into a pinch and us not be able to help them.  So how do (decent) parents handle the financial ""separation""?

We've got about 647 more questions, but at the moment those are the ones we feel the most worried about.

Thanks and I appreciate any/all advice!

I don’t have many people to talk to about finances, and I would like to handle things as best as possible. I currently don’t have a car, but I am going to be putting all my savings from work towards a car, and I’ve found one for $5,600 ($6,300 after fees, taxes, etc), and I also want to start investing in savings accounts (ROTH’s, multifaceted investment accounts, daily investing, possible trading). I know I’m not providing a lot, but I just don’t even know what to share to get advice. I would like to get a car as soon as possible, I have nearly no money saved, and it would open up my life a lot more, so that’s why I’m prioritizing it, as well as the fact that I only have a few months before it gets cold and rainy, and I won’t be able to commute to work easily without a car (bike/public transportation commute around 1.2 hours, with a car it’s 20 minutes). I don’t know anything about loans, and I’m pretty scared to have absolutely any debt for fear of not having enough to pay it back before the interest causes me to pay even more, like I’ll never be able to pay it off. But would it be a smart financial decision to try and opt for a loan? Either now, or maybe after I save $3,000 or $5,000? I want to be able to afford the car and pay it off quickly, and my main issues are these two. 1) If I get a loan sooner, and get the car, the loan will be a lot bigger, needing $6,000 or so, it would make work commute much easier, and allow for more flexibility, but I would need to pay monthly for insurance, the loan, gas, and other car expenses, which may make it difficult to feel comfortable with my savings/income. 
Or, option 2) I can try and work as much as possible before the weather gets worse, which the work isn’t hard, but I chance a lot of risk having to ride a bike upwards of 20-30 miles daily, which is mentally and physically exhausting, and I would be doing it nearly everyday, but it lets me save money for a car. I could make maybe around half the car price, $3,200 estimate, in maybe a month to two months? Would that be a better idea to get a small loan with less interest and less to pay back?

personalfinance,Credit card is giving me balance transfer offer. What’s the best way to maximize it?,"I have a card thru one of the large banks. For one of the cards, they’re giving me either a 9 month at 0% apy or 15 months at 0.99% apy. Total amount is $9500

The balance transfer would incur a 3% BT fee so for 9 months, I’d have to net more than $285. 

For the 15 months, the 0.99% apy would incur a total interest of $118. So my total return would have to be greater than ~$405.  

I could keep it in my HYSA but I’m not sure the 4%+ will last for the duration (plus taxes would might just make me breakeven with the BT fee).

I like a lot of other junior military members got to their first duty station and bought a car. Nice lil 2020 Kia Forte with 68,000 miles. Recently got it banged up pretty bad that I’m scared my insurance might call it a total loss. I still have 14,000 dollars left on the loan and I doubt the total loss payment will cover all of it. I get paid 1,100 twice a month and most of my bills are on the first paycheck. But the last few months I’ve been scrapping by near pay day, even going into the negatives on my banking account. I have a car loan, insurance, WiFi, and phone plan. As well as a girlfriend that always wants to go out and eat as well as other plans.

personalfinance,Buying your own car and path to adulthood,"Hi guys,

I am 28M, single, and live with fam in the bay area. I use my family's car to commute and I make about $100K a year with savings.

I'm getting to the age where I feel like (also with societal pressure) I should have my own things i.e. my own car and my own place to live. However, I am happy living with family until I have even more money saved, and/or until I meet someone to move out with. With that said, I recently found a car I really like (mazda cx-50 hybrid), and I wondered to myself if it's time to buy my own car. With tax, fees, etc the car would likely be \~$45K, which I can afford. However, it doesn't feel like a need but more so a want. My family don't really use cars that much, except for me. We have a 2014 subaru forester and 2007 toyota camry which are very robust cars.

As I have implied, I feel like having my own car would be a boost in the current dating world. Though, I also recognize that it could also be my own ego/confidence talking. Would you buy a car in my story? How else would you use this money? I'm curious to see what other people think and if they have any advice for my scenario.

I’m currently putting away 15% to her trad 401k and maxing out mine, and maxing out both Roth IRAs. I am also contributing $300 per month to both of my kids 529s. 

My current mortgage payment is only $1800 per month, but with the larger homes we’re looking at plus the much higher mortgage rates these days we’re looking at up to like $5000/month for an $800k home. With our current budget, the kids daycares, car payment, and our retirement savings, I can’t even come close to affording that. 

So what I’m wondering is how much I can safely dial back our retirement savings to make the monthly payments on a better house for our family.

Hey Reddit,

I’m a 25M based in Toronto, working in financial services. I make around $140k CAD in a commission-driven role and have managed to save up about $60k.

I’ve maxed out my FHSA and have about $30k of contribution room left in my TFSA, which I should be able to fill by the end of 2025. I currently hold 2,500 out of 5,000 shares vested in my company, which I can purchase for $6.75 per share. The CEO has indicated that there will be future liquidation opportunities, with an estimated selling price of $15 CAD per share. However, I can only purchase these shares while I’m employed at the company.

My current investment strategy has been to dollar-cost average into the S&P 500 through my retirement accounts. With the S&P hitting all-time highs consistently, I’m wondering if I should start allocating more towards my company’s private stock.

While I wouldn’t be able to hold this stock in a tax-advantaged account, it has the potential to significantly outperform the market and represents a limited-time opportunity. If I leave the company, I won’t be able to buy the shares anymore.

I don’t know what my deal is, but I tend to over analyze the vast majority of my purchases and now and then get immediate buyer’s remorse. I really don’t know why - I have a great paying job, I’m an avid YNAB user, and I never do any frivolous spending. I rarely spend money on myself. I don’t have credit card debt. But for some reason I over analyze most purchases to the point where it leaves me anxious and don’t go through with the purchase. On top of this, I get instant buyer’s remorse a lot of times.

Recent example - I was thinking it would be fun to upgrade my tv. I can absolutely afford what I was looking at, but I kept feeling guilt of “you don’t need this, the current one is fine” or “you could instead use the money towards a vacation with regroup family” and other things like that. I even went as far as placing the order, instantly became regretful, and immediately canceled the order. I felt the purchase was unnecessary and unwise, even though it was easily affordable. And then I feel like an idiot for feeling the way I do. It’s a fun cycle!

personalfinance,Buyer's Remorse? Thinking of selling my new car for a cheaper one.,"Hi everyone, 

I'm seeking advice on of it's a sensical decision to sell my current car that I bought new for a cheaper one that I'll have paid off sooner; or if I should just keep grinding away and accept the sunk cost.  

Long story short, I got divorced a year ago and was in need of a car. Maybe hastily, I bought a 2024 Subaru Crosstrek. I'm overall pleased with the car. I don't really want to sell it, but I hate having a car payment more than I thought I would. I'm definitely feeling the strain on my wallet. And, I'd rather use the funds for savings and travel. 

I split the financing between an auto loan at 5.39% and a HELOC at 3.25%. The total original balance was around $32,000.

The current balance on the auto is \~ $11,800 and payments are $300/mo. 

The current balance on the HELOC is \~ $14,200. Minimum payment \~ $140, but I am paying $300. 

The reason I'm paying more on the HELOC is because I'd like to free up the funds to actually use for my home improvements. 

So total debt against the car is \~ $26k. I've paid down around $6k in a year and a half. 

Between the two loans, trying to pay it off early,  I am paying $600/mo for it, which I can swing but I'm definitely feeling the pinch. Auto insurance is about $80/mo. 

For simplicity's sake and not having a back up car in the meantime, I'm assuming I would end up trading at a dealership and best case, break even on the debt against it.  

I do also get a small bonus in the new year where I'd apply at least $1,500 towards the auto loan. 

  


A couple of options going on in my head to get out of this loan:

1.) Trade and get a $10-$15k car---then I have to worry about breaking down/maintenance without a back up car or person. I estimate this would be \~ $10k less of a loan though.

2.) Decrease 410k contributions from 11% down to 5% which is the company match- this would free up \~$200/mo to apply to a loan. I am currently earning 8% on my 401k though. 

3.) Just keep my head down. Eat beans and rice. Apply any extra funds to the auto loan.

personalfinance,I am 19 in 10k of medical debt,"
Hi all, I need some advice. I (19F) made a very stupid mistake with my insurance and now owe around $10k to a recovery program that I was in for about two months. This is not a physical hospital but an online program, so I am responsible for the entire amount.  

Currently, I am unemployed and a full-time college student, about a year away from finishing an Associate's degree. I want to complete my classes. I live at home, and my only necessities cost $240 a month for medications and copays for doctor appointments. I don’t own a car and can’t drive yet, I am working on that.  

I do receive money for school from a relative, but I don’t have access to the account. The money is specifically for tuition and books only.  

Right now, I feel defeated and filled with dread. I am looking for full and part time jobs in the area but am unsure if I can manage two jobs and being a student. I plan to take a break between finishing my Bachelor’s to focus on paying off this debt.  I currently have only around 3k in my account between my checking and savings.

I would really appreciate any advice. I know I made a stupid mistake, and I understand that I need to take responsibility and work my way out of this. Any help is welcome, thank you!  

For context, the mistake I made was allowing the company to think my secondary insurance was my primary. Unfortunately, they don’t accept my primary insurance, and my secondary insurance won’t pay because they are not liable (which I completely understand). Please don’t make my mistake!

personalfinance,asked to co-sign parents' bridge loan,"edit: confirmation is all i needed. wish i could help, but i don't think this is the move. here's hoping they don't hold this against me.  
  
Hi all, hoping you can all help me out here with a sanity check.

My parents currently own a \~900k home with no mortgage. They worked with a builder to build a $500k home. The plan has been to sell the old home and buy the new home. The new home finished much earlier than expected and the builders are trying to close ASAP. My parents just found out so they're listing their existing home this week.

My parents want to get a bridge loan, here's how it works from my understanding:

This loan company will give my parents a loan for the 500k for the new home. They have also made an offer to purchase the old home for well below market value. My parents will have a few months to try and sell their home for more, but if they can't, they're stuck with the below market sale, but at least the sale is guaranteed.

They are okay with all these terms. I would not be if I were in their position. The closing cost fees and the lowball offer are what I would consider predatory, but the difference between the offer they've received and the value of the new home is more than enough to pay these ridiculous fees. They're aware of it, they're okay with it.

But due to my parent's terrible credit, they need someone to cosign on the bridge loan. It kind of blows my mind that their credit is so bad, that they need a cosigner for a bridge loan where the sale home is worth almost 400k more than the new home. It must be really bad.

I want to help my parents, but I need to understand the risks involved. My original concern was ""what happens if/when they can't sell the house?"" The answer seems to be: my parents get bent over a barrel and sell it for much less than market rate but still walk away with something extra. But at least I wouldn't be on the hook for making any kind of mortgage payment.

What questions should I be asking? My wife and I are close to being able to buy our first home, our timeline is Fall 2025 at the very earliest. What can go wrong that can affect our ability to buy?

Will co-signing on a bridge loan remove my eligibility for first time homebuyer programs?

Would this ding my credit rating, and if so, how long would it take to recover? My current experian score is 815.

Would this count towards my debt : income ratio?

Once the house sale is made, will the closing of the bridge loan ding my credit score?

Again, i see how awful this deal is for my parents. They're okay with it and willing to pay the predatory fees out of their profits. What are the worst case scenarios for me if I do decide to help them?",1732060525.0

personalfinance,Hyundai Motor Finance Dispute,"Hi everyone. I had a lease with Hyundai motor finance from 2021-2024.

I normally paid online every month with no issue. In June of 2022 I received a message on the HMF website “error cannot process payment at this time”. I called Hyundai and they informed me it was an error on the website and I could mail a check.

I mailed a check which was never cashed.

This issue proceeds from June-August of 2022. Online payment can’t be processed, advised to mail a check by Hyundai customer service which is never cashed.

I spoke to a representative on the phone about the possibility of Hyundai incorrectly reporting a late payment, and was assured that notes were made in my file about the issue and any issue would be corrected.

In September of 2022 Hyundai reports my account as 90 days late. I call for an explanation and am told my checks were not cashed because they are from a “non-eligible” bank account. I then am presented with the option to pay over the phone, which I do with my debit card from the same “non eligible” bank account. I then ask for the 90 day remark to be removed because I attempted to pay the debt on time and Hyundai refused to cash my mailed checks, and not take payment online.

I was assured the remark would be removed. I asked for this in writing and was told that Hyundai does not provide communications in writing, only billing statements are provided in writing once a month.

The remark is eventually removed and the technical error is fixed. I finish paying all of my payments on time online for the rest of the lease.

I turn in the lease July 2024. 6 weeks later I receive a letter in the mail from Hyundai stating I owe $977.50 in fees and repairs. I purchased wear and tear coverage from Hyundai. I call Hyundai and inform them the bill I have received is wrong because I have purchased insurance and to send me a corrected bill.

In October I receive a letter stating I owe $0. Today I get a credit alert Hyundai reported me delinquent on October 31 for an owed balance of $0, and updated my previously removed 90 day delinquency as back on my report with another superfluous December late payment added on.

What does everyone advise for a dispute letter to the bureaus? Currently I am experiencing multiple late payment errors with various late dates that don’t match, a delinquency of $0, blank date of last activity, false payment history beyond a 36 month lease (39 months of payment history on a 36 month loan)

I have been managing multiple credit accounts ( amex, chase, capital one etc) for 12 years with no negative remarks outside of this Hyundai situation which is ruining my otherwise perfect credit history.",1732052769.0

personalfinance,"Should I, ironically, actualize gains to offset my current stocks losses for the year?","I currently have a closed out trade I sold earlier this year, which was a long-term hold, that has me at -$7000 approx for the year.

I know that $3,000 of this, max, can be used to offset general income as a loss, with the remains indefinitely carried into next year, and future years if that situation presents itself.

I have some large paper gains on NVDA, all long-term holds, and I was curious if the smartest move is to sell some of this now to cover either $7,000 in gains, presuming that then I would not be taxed capital gains taxes on said NVDA sale, or at least $4,000 in gains, leaving me with $3,000 in loss for the year. With earnings tomorrow, and the year’s end coming up, I thought If it could benefit me in this way to trim the position now, it might make sense.

Would the $7,000 actualized loss from the previous long-term hold benefit me more during tax filing than offsetting that loss with NVDA gains to avoid paying future capital gains taxes on NVDA sales? Would this process irrelevant since I’d have at least $3,000 in losses to work with next year from carryover?

Student loans - 12k @ 2-5%

  
This was my situation a few months ago. I still have this debt now. Instead of paying off this debt, I enrolled in flight school to become a pilot. I was approved for a loan to cover the entire cost of my training. This is where it gets incredibly sickening the position I am in. 

So far I’ve used 20k of this loan, which is at a whopping 18% interest rate. The rest is able to be used, but not yet used yet. This also isn’t gaining any interest at this time.

So right now, I am over 50,000 dollars in debt with interest rates as high as 18%.

  
Do I drop out of flight school and grind for several years to get zero debt, and then continue my way through and pay with cash? Or, am I too far in, and I should keep going with flight school and use the rest of the 80k of borrowed money at my disposal?

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans versus Buying a House,"My wife and I have been setting up our emergency fund first as we have had several emergencies that each cost more than 1000 dollars.

My issue is, I don’t want to wait much longer to buy the house. I'll be 26 and she will be 27 if we buy on our projected timeline (June of 2026) without paying off student loans. If we pay loans off first it will take an additional 14-16 months.

personalfinance,Am I crazy for not wanting to use a 401k for retirement?,"I know this is crazy and people might hate on me but I really don't see why you would save money in a 401k for retirement. I understand the tax benefits, but to me it makes much more sense to me to invest your money instead into things will provide you a return, such as businesses or real estate. Some reasons why I think so:

1. **There is no time limit.** This is one of the things that always confused me about retirement planning. You have to assume you'll die and stop needing money at a certain age. What happens if you live past that? With the way things are looking people my age (24) can't count on social security, I doubt it will look the same and may not even be there by the time I'm 80. Also what if I live to be 100? It just doesn't really make sense to me.
2. **You have something to pass on.** If all you do throughout your life is build up a treasure chest that you can live off of when you are ready to stop working where does that leave your kids and/or grandkids? When I pass away I would love to be able to leave a lot for my loved ones, and I hope I don't have to sell it off (As I would a 401k) just to pay for my lifestyle.
3. **You can use the money as you grow old.** For a 401k you are locked into using it at a specific age unless you want to pay penalties for taking it early. Instead of waiting until you are old I think it is better to be able to use your investment's returns as you are getting old. I understand that with compound interest a 401k account would grow also, but it is very hard to use it for specific opportunities such as a business or real estate deal.

I know I'm probably forgetting some, so I'll most likely edit this as time goes on.

Phone allowance per month: $100
PTO: 25 days

I'm in a sales based role and will be joining a start up where I need to produce as well, I would like a base salary of some sort as well as a commission or bonus structure to incentivize myself. The start up's goal is to grow fast and sell the company in 5 years or so, so I also wonder if I should be asking for some sort of ownership percentage although I don't want to sound greedy. But, I am young (29) and question what would happen if we did sell, then what??

After a year, my siblings and I finally got finished with probate a couple of weeks ago and checks were handed out to us from both our parent’s estate.

My current dilemma is that I do not want to deposit those checks with my current bank, Wells Fargo. Although nothing has happened to me yet with all the ‘horror’ stories I’ve heard of other people’s experiences with Wells Fargo, I simply do not want to risk depositing $20k.

With that, I’ve been trying to find a different bank or even a Credit Union to safely deposit that amount (preferably a savings account). However, in the town I live in, there are no local credit unions nearby and the only banks here are Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Bremer Bank.

personalfinance,Using HELOC to buy second property?,"
Currently own a triplex split 50/50 with my brother. Loan is for $440k and property is worth around $590k. Monthly payment including taxes and insurance (PITI) is $4100. Monthly rental income is $5250. All in all cash flowing a little bit after maintenance and capex. Was curious if anyone’s ever taken out a HELOC to purchase their second investment property? I would be splitting it with my brother and combined we have about $80k saved and need a little extra bump for the down payment on another triplex.

I've always lived in poverty and I'm lost?,"So, I just turned 26 in August, did 4 years in the military and completed college and got (what I would consider) A high paying job in tech a month ago. Roughly $145k a year after bonus. I almost completed my PhD so the company I work for gave me a tier 3 or Principal/senior title for work which is very nice. Most of my life I've always lived on the poor side to where 25-50$ was life changing for me certain weeks and I have never had a savings or excess money or familial help. My (ex)fiancé and I moved out here across the country for me to get this job and that cost me everything I had to take a gamble here. And I have since kicked her out. I found out she cheated on me two weeks before we left and called off our engagement. so right now, my total debt is roughly only 12k left on my car, 18k in student loans (even working 40 hours a week while doing college I still needed the money to help paying housing costs) and my rent out here where I live is 2300$ a month... So for the first time in my life. Especially now as a single man. I have what I would consider to be plenty of excess money at the end of the month. I have no prior savings, no real immediate danger debts other than those normal ones and walk away with roughly $5,000 at the end of every month after all bills (including fun things). And one thing I have never been taught once you reach this point is... What do you do with it? I feel weird just having it sit, and I feel like I need to be actively doing something?

I'm looking for some advice on managing my investments and brokerage accounts. Here's a snapshot of my current situation:

Edward Jones Brokerage Account: ~$38,000
High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA): ~$42,000
Roth IRA (Fidelity): ~$4,058 (on track to be maxed out)

personalfinance,Investment accounts to pay for mortgage,"Had a debate with a buddy about paying a large down payment vs making investments and paying your monthly mortgage using interest from accounts. Neverminded who's right or wrong I just want to see if this is even plausible.

His argument was basically saying if you had $71,000 you could invest it at a 3.5% rate of return (per month). You would be able to pay your $2500 monthly mortgage completely off of interest.

personalfinance,Roth IRA or Taxable Brokerage?,"I recently started taking my finances seriously. I’m aggressively paying off about $90k of private student loans and am making great progress so far ($1000 extra per monthly payment). 

I currently put about $20 per week into my brokerage account. Although it’s not much, seeing my account grow from $0 to $1000 in about a year has kept me motivated and ultimately helps me aggressively pay off my debt. I also see this weekly investment as a learning experience to prepare me to manage my finances after I pay off my debt.

One thing I’m not sure about is if I should continue to invest this amount into my brokerage account, or a Roth IRA. I initially decided to use a brokerage account because I’m already putting 12% of my post-tax pay into my employer’s retirement account. It didn’t seem right to me to put this money into a Roth IRA when I still haven’t maxed out my post-tax contributions to my retirement account. 

As I learned more about investing, I see that it’s possible to withdraw contributions from a Roth IRA penalty-free, and there are exceptions for certain uses. While my small weekly investment started as a way to learn and motivate myself, seeing the balance hit $1,000 made me start thinking about how I can use this money to buy a house or get a masters degree. Now, I’m not sure where I should put my money.

Given my current situation, is there anything else I should consider or am I over complicating this?",1732049161.0
personalfinance,Thoughts on my path forward?,"I (26) got into debt after living above my means for a few years after college. I have spent the last two years working with a therapist and studying financial literacy, and I have resolved a lot of my financial self-sabotage. Everything felt possible until April 2023, when my car got totaled. The car market was recovering from COVID-19, supply was limited, and used cars were absurdly overpriced. I instead leased a new 2023 Nissan Rogue. I went from having a paid-off 2011 Kia Sorento to a $564 lease payment. That was when I knew I had to change significantly to turn this pattern around.

Since then, I have moved from an extremely HCOL area to a LCOL area, which also cut my renters and car insurance in half, I haven't added any debt to my credit cards and stick to monthly budgets, I took on a second job and have seen a change in myself but no change in my finances. I used to need a car for work but now that I moved I wfh and could go without a car for a while, however it is not as easy as just selling it as its a lease.

So, the path forward seems to be that I should get a loan for the car, turn around and sell it, and then go without a car and put the car payments towards my CC debt. This is fine and dandy, except I have maxed out my CCs and can't get approved for the car loan. So I plan to cash out my 401K to pay off some CC debt, improve my credit score enough for the car loan, buy and sell the car, and then put the extra money towards rebuilding the 401K and CC debt. The financial breakdown below:

Age: 26

Income: $71,600- take home $3,872

Rent: $1,300

Bills and food: $500

Car Lease: $564

Discover: $12,323/12,600 at 18.99% ($412.00/month)

Chase: $6,431.75/6,500 at 22.49% ($289.75/month)

USAA: $2,436.08/2,500 at 28.65% ($125.00/month)

Personal Loan: $14,279.78 at 17.99% ($499.00/month)

Student Loans: $9,407.86 at 0.00% ($0.00/month - payments resume TBD)

401K: $9,500 available after taxes and penalty

If I were to take from my 401k, what would you apply the 9.5 towards? I would like to pay off the Chase and USAA, freeing up $414/month and improving my credit utilization to get approved for the lease buyout loan. I'm afraid that taking from the 401k is the easy way out, but right now, it seems like the only way out besides drowning for another two years until I can return this lease. I can't make this decision on my own. I don't trust myself enough yet, but I really want what is best, and hopefully, people here can see that without judgment. Thank you",1732048965.0
personalfinance,Seeking Financial Advice for My Mother Facing Homelessness in Kentucky,"I’m reaching out to see if anyone can provide guidance or help me create an action plan for my mother, who is in an extremely difficult financial situation. 

She lives in Kentucky, and she has been with my stepfather (though they were never legally married) for over 14 years. During this time, he handled all financial responsibilities—housing, bills, groceries, etc. Unfortunately, they are now separating on bad terms, leaving my mother without any financial stability or assets to her name, my ""step father"" is saying he owes her nothing and since they were never legally married he doesn't need to take care of her or help her anymore and is completely kicking her out on the curb so to speak. 

Here’s some background:

* She has been on disability and SSI her entire life and currently receives about $800/month in benefits.
* She has no work experience and has never held a job.
* She is 60 years old and has health conditions, including cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, which further complicate her ability to work. 
* She has not yet applied for food stamps or other assistance programs, and I’m unsure of her eligibility or the best way to navigate these systems in the state.
* She has no savings.
* She was looking at trailers to purchase but the high interest rates and cost far exceeds her income. 

I recommended public housing as a potential solution, as this was something we relied on during my childhood when she raised me and my sister with the same income. However, I don’t know how feasible, affordable or accessible that option is now. I also suggested she consider looking for work, but she is very resistant to the idea due to her health and lack of experience.

To be transparent, my relationship with my mother is complicated to say the least, and while I want to help her, I cannot provide financial support or a long-term living arrangement due to our past history. I’ve told her that if she stays with me temporarily, it will be limited to 90 days and I would make her sign documentation and an agreement to be out after 90 days, as I am unable to take on the responsibility of supporting her indefinitely which I know would happen.

I am at a loss for how to help and would greatly appreciate any advice.

I don't use my credit cards anymore, but I have two with high interest rates. I also have a car loan with a high interest rate. Accounts are as follows, starting with the largest;

Credit Card 1. $15,700 owed left. 16% Interest, but I used it for Cash Advance a lot which is 20%. Monthly Mimimum is $350, I've been paying $400. (I've already paid over 2k in just interest this year)

Car Loan: $5,700 left. 18% APR. Monthly Payment is $190. I've been paying $200.

Credit Card 2. $900 left. 18% interest rate. I don't see a minimum on it, but I've been paying $100-$150.

As for assets, I have 22k in a retirement account compounding, but I haven't touched it and I don't want to.

personalfinance,is the tax on pulling money out of brokerage acct and roth ira the same ?,"idk a lot about finance, all i know is stick a decent chunk of money in something stable and never touch it. 

before this year i had tens of thousands of dollars sitting in a regular savings account, out of my adhd boredom i started watching all these finance videos and learned that i had been missing out on basically free money for years. 

I’m not that smart and i can barely make heads or tails out of how complex everything seemed so i gave up on trying to figure out and just started experimenting. 

i put half my money is a HYSA with amex, i left some money in my regular saving account for if i need instant access, i put some money in bitcoin, ethereum and solana, i invested some in a roth ira and invested some in a brokerage account. 

I was thinking of putting more in my brokerage account but i’m wondering if i might as well put it in my roth ira. I am 22 im not big on saving and i think its stupid when people tell 22 year olds to stick half of their money in an ira like tbh i don’t care if im rich when im 70 for lack of better or more mature phrasing i want to buy cool stuff now and enjoy my life as much as responsibly possible. As of now my priority is not to save, I only put my leftover money into savings. I might wake up tomorrow and want to buy a new car or i might not, point being I don’t have any goals as far as purchases i want to make or money i want to save. 

Which brings me to my question. I figure that on the chance that i don’t decide to make any huge purchases then its better to have the money in my roth ira than a brokerage account, but if i do decide to take the money out does it make a difference in whether it was in a roth ira or brokerage account in terms of the tax or fees i would have have to pay on my gains ? Is it that the brokerage account only taxes gains and the ira taxes the full amount withdrawn? or are the both taxed on the gains only 


EDIT: Just to clarify i am referring to money that is invested, i know that i can retrieve uninvested money at no cost. ",1732044646.0
personalfinance,Why would I ever do a HSA?,"I did a HSA once. For a year, I had to pay for basically every out of pocket.

This year, I had a big surgery and I shudder to think what it would have cost me if I stayed on the high deductible plan. I moved to a EPO and the surgery only cost me $50.

personalfinance,I feel like I wasted $10k on a car that is having nothing but issues since I got it,"I thought I was doing a financially responsible thing by buying a 10 year old SUV in cash. I bought a 2015 VW for 10k like a year ago and paid all in cash. 

It’s been a year since I’ve had it, and it’s been nothing but issues. Constant engine lights coming up with new codes. Trying to fix things and replacing parts just for that to not be the issue. I feel like I just wasted 10k because I feel like the sensible thing is to get rid of it before even bigger issues come up. 

I’m 26, have about 10k in my savings at the moment. (I paid off my student loans in one huge chunk) so I have no debt. I live at home but I’m looking to get a place with my girlfriend in the next year. Does anyone have advice for what I should do? I feel like eventually my engine is going to blow and then at that point I couldn’t even sell it. Should I just accept my losses and sell it for what I can?

personalfinance,Recasting current home vs. keeping the old home as rental ,"I recently purchased a new home, the original intent was to sell my previous home and to recast my mortgage to lower my new homes monthly payment but the market has slowed down some - I am currently paying two mortgages. I am now considering my options with the previous property, lowering the asking price, or keeping it as a rental for a min. of 6 months or potentially longer if it works out. 

My previous homes principle balance is approx. 209k, the interest rate is 2.99% and the monthly mortgage PITI is approx. $1,450. The monthly rental price would be anywhere between 2,100-2,300 a month. 

When I use the recasting calculators my monthly payment does not seem to drop very significantly on my new home, my current principal balance is approx. 534k, the interest rate is 6.5% and the monthly mortgage PITI is approx. $4,400. The goal is to put down an additional 90k.

personalfinance,"I've followed Ramsey's Baby Steps up to this point. Now that I'm in BS 4/5/6, should I consider a different approach?","I'm looking for whether there are better options toward my plan, now that my wife (45f) and I (38m) are out of debt (besides the mortgage). My plan is below, but I'm open to hearing from you all!

Basic details about our situation:

* Gross income is $210,000
* Loan on new home is $664,000. 30 years at 7.1% and monthly mortgage is $4,473. If rates go down in 12-24 months, we'll refinance.
* We have about $100,000 saved for retirement.
* We have two kids in the home with us, ages 16 and 5.

**Baby Step 4 - Save 15% for Retirement**

We currently are saving about 19% of our gross income toward retirement. These are our monthly contributions. The plan below allows us to max out employer matching and Roth, outside of my wife's contributions because she does not receive any employer match. Anything different we should be doing here, perhaps taking my wife's $250 and putting it toward a college fund?

* $834 that I contribute through my employer's plan
* $1,007 contributed by my employer to that same plan
* $250 that my wife contributes
* $1,166 that we contribute to our Roth IRA

**Baby Step 5 - Save for College**

I work in higher education, so it's completely possible that one or both of our children can benefit from tuition remission down the road. Our first daughter did this, and when I left for a different institution, the three of us were able to bankroll her tuition. As we're new to this stage, we are open to recommendations here.

**Baby Step 6 - Pay Off Home**

As mentioned, our monthly mortgage is currently $4,473. We plan to pay an even $5,000. Online calculations show that doing so will allow us to pay the home off 8 years early, even if we never refinance. I do wonder if putting that additional $527/month toward college would be more beneficial. If so, would there be a split that makes more sense to benefit our oldest, as he is 2.5 years from starting college and pour more into our youngest's account when he is done.",1732042654.0

personalfinance,Open enrollment has begun at work. Questions about retirement and HSA specifically.,"My work has open enrollment for 2025 benefits now. I'm staff at a public community college, so we get health insurance, a 457, 401k, an HSA, and a pension. Trying to figure out what's best for me--I'm 27, single, and only intend to stay here another 2 years maximum.

**General info:**

* I make $22.04 an hour pre-tax and work 40 hours per week. We are paid bi-weekly, so 26 paychecks a year. My pre-tax paychecks are $1,763.20. Post-tax I get $1,170.17. Rent is $615 and utilities are $120.
* Federal and state income tax is about $300, union dues are about $37, my health insurance is about $78 (premium + HSA contribution), 457 contribution is about $70, and my pension contribution is about $110. 

**Health insurance:**

* The premium (once per paycheck, paid bi-weekly) for 2024 was $15, and it's $33 for 2025. Not a huge jump, but still. The deductible is now $1,650, co-insurance is $650, and the maximum out of pocket is $2,300.
* My employer contributes $825 to my HSA, which leaves me with $3,475 left to contribute in the year. Divided per paycheck, that's about $133.65 per paycheck. This is a lot. I'm currently contributing $63--this will get me just past the maximum out of pocket by the end of the year. I felt it was the safest minimum amount to contribute.

**Retirement:**

* I have a 457 that I contribute to (always 100% vested) and a 401k that my employer contributes to. The sheet shows a 2% contribution by me for savings, and a 1% match by my employer; then a 2% contribution by me for PHF, and a 2% match by my employer. I don't fully understand the division since the 457 and 401k are not divided into savings and private health fund.
   * I'm currently contributing 4% to my 457 assuming I receive a 3% match from my employer.
* I also contribute 6.2% for my pension with a 6.2% employer match.

**Other:**

* I also have a Roth IRA and HYSA that I contribute to when I can, even if it's just a tiny bit. Usually, I dump as much as I can into the Roth from my savings at the beginning of the year, and then just contribute to my savings as the year goes on.

**Questions:**

* Should I prioritize maximizing my HSA contributions? I've heard this is the best thing to do before contributing to a Roth IRA, but I don't make a ton of money as-is.
* Which retirement elections should I prioritize? I've heard HSA, then 401k/457, then Roth IRA. Just want to make sure that tends to be correct.
* If I leave this job, will my HSA go with me or will I be forced to transfer it to my 457 or forfeit/withdraw it and take the penalty? I suspect this is a question for the bank that holds my HSA, just wondering if there's a standard practice.",1732041836.0
personalfinance,best credit card-type option for a family member who falls for scams?,"Hi. I have an aging family member (approaching 80yo) who seems utterly incapable of not falling for a scam -- constantly giving people her credit card info for faux virus protection, or answering deceptive texts that solicit money. Thankfully most of these have been caught by credit card fraud alerts -- though we've had to repeatedly cancel and get new cards for her.

Short of taking away her phone entirely and isolating her from those remaining loved ones who she does keep in touch with over the phone, I'm looking for ways to limit her downside risk with these scammers. 

My family and I have been considering removing any traditional credit cards from her possession and perhaps giving her prepaid cards to deal with day-to-day expenses. She's still very autonomous and likes it that way... and there's only so much babysitting we can do of her, and we're already spread thin. Though I suppose we also do like the level of protection the cards give her in terms of fraud detection (it's been caught every time). We've frozen her credit so everything is flagged each time, thankfully.

Are there other, better options for credit card type things, knowing that we'd like to try to give her at least some autonomy and independence, but that the constant scamming-cancel-new card cycle is becoming a real issue?

If I sell a stock worth 25k, even if it has minimal taxable gains, will my AGI go up 25k for the year?

personalfinance,Lost $7k in My Rollover IRA Due to Vanguard’s Mistake,"I’m trying to do a backdoor Roth IRA, but ran into some issues. I had too much income to contribute directly to a Roth, so I recharacterized it to a traditional IRA. The next step is converting it to Roth, but I need to make sure my Vanguard rollover IRA has a $0 balance by year-end (I have 1,225 shares of VTSAX).

I called Vanguard to confirm the price, and they said it would be yesterday’s price. That was wrong, which I discovered later after checking with others. I tried to cancel the transaction, but couldn’t. I sold the shares at $136, missing out on about $6-7k in potential gains. I’ve learned that you don’t know the final price of selling mutual funds until after the sale.

Vanguard admitted the mistake and said they’ll fix it, but there’s an issue. I already rolled over the funds to Fidelity for 167k, and now the balance is $166k due to market downtrun. Didn't think they'll take responsibility with this. Vanguard will adjust as soon as the money reaches my account (so I'll have 1225 VTSAX again, as if the transaction never happened).

The process:

* Vanguard tried to stop the check on Friday, but it was already cashed by Fidelity. Now my balance is $166k. This steps fails.
* Vanguard will ask Fidelity to return the money. I don’t know how long that’ll take. They said it'll take 3 business days to just prep the letter.
* If above doesn't work, they'll go with reimbursement. I don't know what what this means.

If all of above doesn’t work, Vanguard will make an adjustment for the difference. I asked them to just give me adjustment, but they refused unless I go through all of the process. I asked them to speak with supervisor, but need to wait 48 hours. 

My questions:

* Should I leave the money in Fidelity and proceed with the Roth conversion?
* Should I wait for the process to finish, even if it risks missing the Roth conversion and paying taxes on the $7k roth contribution?

personalfinance,Sell off Stock Portfolio to Avoid Taking Out Student Loans ,I'll start with some background on my situation. I'm currently 25 years old in my first year of law school and I do not currently have a paying job. Going forward most of my tuition is covered by a scholarship and the remaining tuition that I have to pay is set aside. I have enough to cover tuition for my remaining semesters without taking out any loans so that is not an issue. Living expenses is another story.

Since then, I have stable contract work that leaves me with around $4800/month gross (I have to withhold the tax from each paycheck myself, I put ~20-25% of each paycheck in a HYSA for taxes). The pay is not great and I am struggling with my debt payments. My emergency fund was siphoned to pay for some unexpected medical bills. I recently committed to a budget that should keep me above water, but to be honest I have pathetic discipline and constantly find myself falling back into overspending and debt. Over the past 3 months, I have stuck to the budget and hope to continue to do so, but my CC debt is crushing.

I have about $6000 in CC debt at 26% that has been drowning me. I’ve stopped charging anything to this card and frozen it, but the interest has been continuing to raise the balance.

I’m wondering how catastrophic of an idea it is to refund my PERA funds and pay off the CC debt and get the cloud out from over my head. I understand how terrible it is to use my future to finance my present, but the stress over these payments and having that balance continue to grow while I can’t make meaningful dents into it has been very hard to shake. I understand that I will have to pay income tax and an additional 10% tax on an early withdrawal so that $9800 I have would likely be somewhere around $6000 or so. 

At my current point in life, having that money seems like a life rope to get off a sinking ship. Of course I recognize that without commitment to changing my lifestyle and spending habits, i’ll soon be in the same position but without $10,000 for retirement. I just can’t figure out what to do.

The other option would be to pull it out and roll over to an IRA and invest with those funds, but I’m not exactly sure how to do that either without incurring tax penalties.

Any advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated, even though I know /r/personalfinance might seppuku before suggesting that someone early withdraw retirement funds haha.",1732038554.0

I’m not financially savvy. I’m good at saving and paying my bills. Never had an upbringing that taught me about investing nor have I educated myself on it. My parents were convinced into buying a whole life insurance policy in which they convinced me so that will give you and idea about my knowledge of financial instruments. I bought it at age 23 and now at 39 the cash value is a little north of 40k. I plan on cashing it out and adding it to the 125k as advised by an advisor.  

-I make 100k, my wife about 60k
-I have a mortgage, about 240k left on it. 4% interest rate, bought in 2015
-we have a 4 year old
-one car payment, my wife some student loans 
-I’m a blue collar worker- I get a pension at the end. No 401k, no IRA. 

My grandmother passed away and left me 125k. She had lived her last 50 years off of her brokerage account. My inclination is to just take the money and start my own brokerage account and IRA and let it grow. She had and advisor manage her account, which was much larger than what I received from her. The management company that handled her account is happy to open one for me. She trusted them and was with them for decades. Since I don’t know much, would it be better for them to just manage it for me? Should I just take the money and open my own vanguard or Schwab? I’m assuming the fees would be similar.

personalfinance,Advice on buying a house from a friend,"Hey everyone, throwaway account here...

My partner and I have two middle school kids and have been renting a house from a ""friend"" for the past 4 years since they moved out and needed tenants during COVID. I say ""friend"" because we've drifted apart but nothing negative has happened. We love the place and after renting for 20+ years we'd like to settle down. We want to find a deal that works well for both of us. Here's the situation:

* **The House:** Located in a now-desirable (gentrified) neighborhood, purchased for $300k in 2008, now worth about $1 million.
* **Our Finances:** Gross income of $200k this year, expecting a $200k work bonus next year and could use $100k for down payment. Partner going to start generating income next year. $20k in the bank. No credit card debt. $500/mo car payment.
* **History:** We've been renting this house for 4 years at $3,500-$3,600/month and have been excellent tenants.
* **Our Goal:** Buy the house so that we can settle down and make it our own - it has huge potential. We also want to make it beneficial for both parties.

We're exploring options like:

* **Straightforward purchase with a first time homebuyer mortgage:** A little below market value since we're saving them realtor fees.
* **Owner financing:** Potentially at 5% interest??
* **Rent-to-own:** Lock in a contract for either of the above with an option to purchase, while we wait for the bonus.

My questions for you:

* What are the pros and cons of each option for both us and the seller?
* How can we structure a deal that's truly win-win?
* Is 5% owner financing attractive in this market/next year? What are the benefits for the seller beyond the lower rate?
* Any other creative solutions we haven't considered?

Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",1732033302.0

Besides normal maintenance (timing belt and breaks) rear hybrid differential went out. I already spend 5k on this suv. Now it needs new exhaust (I fixed it once, but new leak came up, it looks like I need to replace the whole thing. It will be $750 if I do it myself or 1500 for my mechanic to do it.)

I’m looking for serious advice or opinions on how to pull myself out of the financial hole I’m in and build a better future for my family. Here’s my situation:	

I’m 23 years old, my wife is 21, and we have an 18-month-old toddler.

My wife is a full-time student and doesn’t currently work.

I take home $640 a week with my current job.

We have nearly $9,000 in combined credit card debt and no significant savings.

I’m about to start a new job that’s a pay cut from $21/hour to $18/hour, but it offers more room for growth and commission potential.

We’ve already cut our budget way back to the essentials:

I’m eating one meal a day to save on groceries.

Rent is $500/month, which is as low as we can reasonably get.

We don’t pay for any streaming subscriptions or other non-essentials.

Goals:

1.	Pay off the $9k in credit card debt as quickly as possible.

2.	Start saving for an emergency fund.

3.	Build a long-term financial plan for stability and growth.

Questions:

1.	What are the best strategies to tackle this level of credit card debt? I’m already looking into balance transfers and potentially a debt consolidation loan.

2.	How can I boost my income quickly, even while starting a new job? I’m willing to hustle and explore side gigs or other options.

3.	What are some practical budgeting tips that have worked for you when money is already cut back to the bone?

4.	Any advice for balancing finances with a young family and a student spouse?

personalfinance,Is it possible to have a conversation on the Roth vs Trad IRA question?,"I am long retired and worked before Roth IRAs were a thing and am a bit surprised by the love of the Roth over the traditional IRA here.    It seems to me to be a math problem.    Higher tax rates while working means use the deduction and lower tax rates in retirement means take advantage of the lower tax burden.   Yes there are RMDs but that is why you are investing for retirement to use that money when you are no longer working.

My career started out like yours I imagine.  Low 20% incremental tax rate, but as I got older I was able to make iit to higher brackets and lived in a state with state income tax, so typically paid an incremental tax rate in the upper 20% and occasionally lower 30%.   So I needed and valued the tax deduction.   Now many years in retirement we are running around the 24% incremental bracket.   There is no way a Roth IRA would have made since in my case.

personalfinance,Transferring both a roth and traditional 401k into matching IRAs - how do I avoid pro rata rule violations?,"Hey everyone.

I have been offered a new job that I am strongly considering taking.

With my current employer, I have both a traditional 401k as well as a roth 401k.

The new employer will offer a 403b, I'm not sure whether it is a traditional, roth, or both. 

I also maintain a POST TAX traditional IRA I have historically used *only* for serving as an account for performing a backdoor roth. I also, of course, have a roth ira. This is because of the sunsetting provisions and my pay being somewhat bursty, it was easier to contribute the max amount of POST TAX dollars into the traditional on jan 2nd, then once the funds had cleared, convert it all to roth. 

I think my plan is currently as follows:

1. Open a new traditional IRA that is set up for pre-tax dollars.
2. Perform a rollover of my roth 401k into the roth IRA.
3. Perform a rollover of my traditional 401k into the pre-tax traditional IRA.
4. In the new year once the dust has settled and jobs have been changed, I will invest into the roth IRA directly since I won't be earning enough to worry about sunset anymore.

I am specifically looking to avoid transferring my 401ks into the 403b as most educational services locally use extremely high cost 403b providers (equitable) and I don't really want to be paying 1-2% on my investments when I could be paying a much lower rate at vanguard where my IRAs are located.

The new position will not be earning as much as the old one, and so I believe I can avoid doing the backdoor roth IRA into the future.

Does this all make sense? I know rolling the 401k into the ira can trigger pro rata issues so I just want to get some eyes on this to make sure it all makes sense.",1732028530.0

personalfinance,"Ex-Poor turned Super Saver because Business is Going Well, But Now What? How do I set myself up best when a house could finally be in my future? Or do I help my partner with their debt?","Hi there, I'm not used to posting on Reddit so forgive me if I worded any of this poorly Z\_Z.

  
So I'm (31) a small business owner in the creative/artistic/performance industry (technically a sole proprietor w/o an LLC if it matters), and things have gone really well for me. I'm saving thousands of dollars almost every month, mostly in hopes of buying a house one day. Up until last year, I've been pretty poor, so this is a new development for me, and one I have no idea what to do with (a good problem to have, though, admittedly). 

I figured at this rate I was going to be able afford a house sooner than later, so I've just kept it uh, is liquid the right term? in savings accounts with 3.5-5% APY, but now that I've saved up over 60k that way (and my partner is no longer in a financial position to help fund a house--most of which are fairly expensive here in the Denver market), I just feel like I should be doing something \*more\* with it while we wait/I save as it could be anywhere from 1 to 5 years. I also don't need to save up a down payment that large even if I wanted to keep a large sum of money handy. 

Seeing as I'm a freelancer and have always been a freelancer with no 401K, SS, etc, I've been advised to put the maximum allotment into a Roth IRA, but that's kind of about all the advice I've gotten. I've also been considering helping my partner out with their debt since that'll ultimately be a consideration that affects our loan options (and them paying 20%+ on interest is definitively worse than me earning an extra 5-10% through investments, or so I assume). Of course if I did do that, rest assured there would be a contract of some form of fashion. (I love them to pieces, but I'm careful with my money because I remember what it's like to work a lot harder for a lot less). And I have no debt to pay down personally. Other than that I already have about 35k in other savings/investments from previous years, not including the 60k+ figure above. (As a freelancer, I really just try to 'over-save' as much as possible haha. No health insurance, no retirement accounts, etc. Just seems really important to do I guess.)

What do you all recommend for me to best setup my financial future and/or house buying prospects? Preferably something that's really simple/easy to manage and/or access. I'm the type of person who hates having more than one credit card, bank account, and prefers to use apps for ease and accessibility of use (for instance, I have an Acorns account, and considered looking into Roots, at one point I invested into Crypto--good and bad that haha), but I'm definitely willing to hear out more complicated options if they're significantly better.

personalfinance,Debt To Income Ratio Question,"Hi, I have recently been trying to calculate my Debt to income ratio. When I did this I originally added a mortgage payment of around $1800 a loan payment of about 252 and a car payment of about 494.

Now the 494 is the minimum i was asked to pay at the beginning of my loan. I’ve overpaid significantly on it, and my credit union is telling me I only owe something like a dollar next month and I don’t actually owe payments until April of 2025. I’m assuming they do this so they can recoup the interest they’re losing. 

But what Im looking to know is, if I’m calculating my DTI for as it sits currently, should I still be using the original agreed upon number of 494 in my DTI calculation? Or do I use the minimum the account says is due. I’m very new to this and was hoping for a clear answer ",1732026407.0

She recently stopped working due to some mental health issues she has been having, and signed up for social security.  What she is making on social security doesn't cover bills for the month.  She is panicking about her future, which only adds to her issues.  Fortunately, she has the house, and what i consider a decent amount of money in a few separate accounts.  I am not any good with finance, so i thought i would ask here.  Between the equity she has in the house, and the money in the bank, i feel as though the money could be working harder than it is, although i may be wrong.

The house  is too big for her needs, but the mortgage is about a thousand dollars cheaper than any rent around.  Maybe it makes sense to sell the house and downsize and pocket some of that money?  I don't know much about the market, and her mortgage is so cheap.  Also, it might make sense for her three kids to split the mortgage if I can get the other two on board, if we are going to get the house anyways one day.

personalfinance,Evaluating whether I should enter an employment program or not,"Just last year I went from being legally blind and having 95% of my visual acuity in my remaining eye to losing most of my central vision. I'm in my mid 20s and several years back I moved from Virginia to the Deep South after graduating college. Truthfully I've never found my footing career-wise. It's been floated to me that I should join the Blind Enterprise Program, which offers disabled people in my situation the opportunity to (effectively) operate food service and micro-retail businesses, think vending machines in government offices and state prisons. While I may prefer to become a teacher, the licensing procedure in my state takes four years on top of a Bachelor's degree, while this program takes about 20 weeks. Thinking long-term, I'd definitely not mind becoming a teacher.. but the time to get a licnese feels like a hindrance.  I have 3 years of experience in purchasing and am finding it difficult to get hired on by a company, so I see this as something to do for the next 4-5 years that can help me live on my own.

While I am going off of limited data, gross income for sites I have seen ranges from 60-90k/annum, net proceeds are about 1/2 to 1/3rd. Top-line national figures suggest the average is around 50k/yr. In a purely mathematical sense, it seems like a good idea.

 There are a few issues I can see arising:

1) Getting over the stigma of this not being a ""side hustle"" but, you know, basically a full time job. It's low-skilled gig work with a lot of government bureaucracy involved. I'm paraphrasing from some book, but ""it's hard to see a potential path out if you're stuck in a room without much opportunity"".

2) While startup costs are minimal, most locations I've heard of are located outside of my county and in general far from civilization (think a prison commissary). Logistically, I don't know how you service those without spending 4 hours in a car simply driving to the location 2 days each week. That's not feasible for most people even hired drivers.

3) Looming issues around tariffs. i previously worked in hospitality purchasing through COVID, I remember the whiplash of supply chain issues and it almost gave me a stomach ulcer. Rising costs way beyond projections and literally no way not to spend the money, the margins and top-line figures seem a bit too optimistic.",1732011282.0
personalfinance,Question about Charge Off and Settlement,"Hello!

Background:  I was self-employed and had a personal loan and credit card through Navy Federal that I defaulted on back in 2021 .. COVID didn't help either. So anyway, I went to apply for a mortgage recently and this negative mark on my credit is hurting me.  I have a few missed credit card payments from a few years ago, but other than those I have been steadily rebuilding my credit and it is rising (around 570 now). Navy Federal has this listed as a ""Charge Off"" on my report, and it just hit my credit report in Sept 2024.

 I contacted Navy Federal to get information about this and they said they are having a third party collect the debt (Apelles, LLC which is a collections agency). I contacted Apelles and they said I can either pay the total debt in full (around $26k) or they will settle with me and I will have to pay $8900 (I looked back through emails from Navy Fed and this is the settlement amount they gave me also, but I was stupid and ignored it). They said they are handling the payment, and once I pay it then they will give to NFCU and then the debt on my credit report will be updated to ""Settled"" and it will no longer be listed as a ""Charge Off"". Apelles also said they will provide me with a letter stating the debt has been settled and they are no longer seeking payment, which I can give to my lender.

My Dilemma: My mortgage lender stated that since Navy Federal has this debt listed as a ""Charge Off"", means they are no longer attempting to collect the debt and they essentially wrote it off and I should receive a 1099 (to essentially report it as income, but I haven't received one). He suggested that I write a letter to NFCU and Apelles to dispute the debt and state that they are reporting this debt incorrectly and that I do not owe it (since it was charged off) according to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. However, when I spoke to Navy Federal, they said they have not charged it off and they are still seeking payment but using a third party to collect payment.

I am confused by all of this, and honestly I want to correct this on my report so that I can move on, build my score again, and get a mortgage. I am able to pay the settlement for $8900. This is the only thing that is weighing me down. I am much more responsible with my spending and I pay my cards in full every month.

personalfinance,Do I sell my condo or rent the extra bedroom? ,"Hi All,

Struggling with a decision I need to make in the next 24 hours (saying yes/no to a potential roommate).

I bought a condo back in 2022 (I've owned for exactly 2 years) in Southern California. Put 20% down, have a high mortgage payment due to interest rates at the time (and still have not fallen).

My industry also went on strike and I lost a LOT of work I thought I was going to have, and it all sort of ran dry. I can cover about half my expenses now with my limited income, and have about a year and a half of savings left.

It's been so hard to find a decent job and I'm going crazy seeing my savings drain. My condo is a 2-BR and I'm considering renting out the extra room which would cover about 1/3 of my mortgage payment. Definitely helps.

But, I don't want a roommate. This would be an easier situation if I was renting and could just move/downgrade, but I own like a big boy now. I was browsing ads for rentals and seeing prices for about 1/2 to 2/3rds my mortgage price in a great area and am drooling a bit. But if I were to sell ALREADY, would all the costs make this whole buying decision I made not worth it? Do I bite the bullet and get a roommate?

If I sold, I'd have access to a good amount of equity that I could rent with and invest in other areas while I continue looking for work. But then I miss the boat on owning. I'm a single male, and this isn't my dream home, it was meant to function more as an investment.

Do I drive myself crazy with a roommate just to keep my condo, or drive myself crazy seeing my savings drain a lot faster? That's where I feel stuck -- what's the price for the peace of mind of living alone?

What would you do? Thanks for reading!

EDIT: Some financial info:

Current mortgage: $4,000/mo.

Roommate portion would be: $1,500/mo.

Rent for a 2-br place I'd live in: $2,600/mo. (so the price would be about even for me, except no roommate and no owning).

personalfinance,18yr old looking to build credit for car loan,"I'm trying to help my daughter build a foundation of smart, safe financial habits, however, I'm not the most fluent in finance myself. She's an extremely intelligent and responsible young adult of whom I'm very proud... and very afraid of letting down in my financial advice. I'm hoping some kind souls here would be willing to offer their thoughts.

Right now she wants to start building her credit to get a small car loan in the future.

In researching guides on Reddit and elsewhere it was recommended she apply for a secured credit card. She recently did and was accepted. Are there best practices in how she utilizes the card? As in how much of her limit she uses at a time? I read that using 30% of a credit card limit is preferred. Any truth to that?

Would it be smart for her to also apply for other credit sources? Perhaps a really small personal loan she can easily pay off in a short period of time? Or would that have a negative effect on her credit score? 

I should note she'll be going to collect in the new year and will have school loans from that. Does that change the approach she should take?

Thanks to anyone who reads this jumbled mess while I'm stressing out over her future!",1731994857.0
personalfinance,"I am in college and I don't need to work to support myself. However, I am in a decent amount of debt. Is working part time worth the added stress, or just focus completely on school?","I just started school back up again this fall and it's going well. Right now I make $3300 a month because of my GI Bill and VA disability. I also work part time as a CNA which brings around $600 an extra a month. I've worked there for too long and I'm debating on either not working at all next semester or trying a CNA job in the Cardio unit at the hospital. The only caveat is it would be 2 12 hour overnight shifts. 

My debt is a $15,700 personal loan at 18% interest. That is less than ideal, I know. Right now my minimum payment is not due until next June of $25. I think the reason is I've paid off $5,000 towards it since this summer, though I'm still paying it off with extra money. I won't start nursing school until 2026, and I'll most likely graduate December of 2027.

Part of me wants to take advantage of not having to work and just focus on school; after all of my expenses, including true expenses and sinking funds I still have $600 dollars to put towards my debt, so I could easily pay it off before I get my RN. That doesn't include the breaks and summer's off in between. On the other hand, this job could be great and I could pay it off faster while also having some extra income. I just don't want to juggle too much, as things have been going well this semester and nursing school will be challenging. I guess I have to figure out if I can trust myself to juggle the job/hours with school, or trust myself to stay disciplined with the budget without working. ",1731994679.0
personalfinance,Home buying advice in southern cali,"Hi,

Me (36m) and my wife (29F) have been wanting to buy a home in orange county, ca for a while. We have no debt and have saved close to $500k, most of it being invested in stocks. 

My wife take home pay is about $7k, and i recently stepped down from my job as a pastor making $5k a month (which I am currently taking a short break and will start looking to get another ministry position in January). One benefit that I will have as an ordained minister is having the benefit of housing allowance. 

My wifes work has a pension plan as our retirement plan, and I have $17k in my Roth IRA with plans to max out my contributions every year. 

With all that information, I'm hoping to get a 3 bedroom and 2 bath home anywhere from $800k to $1mil. The mortgage rates are pretty crazy so I was thinking of putting a high down-payment to reduce our monthly payment.

personalfinance,Should I move out of my parents or stick it through?,"I am 21 years old and I live with my dad. A lot has changed over the past year. My parents split and my mom was the breadwinner. She sends him some money every week (around 200) but not consistently. My grandfather recently passed and gave his house to my dad, this is where we are currently living. It’s rent free, just utilities, and property tax. So now to the problem. I am currently in school and plan on going to nursing school in about 2 years as I still have to do my prerequisites. I am joining the national guard also which will help me save some money for nursing school and tuition assistance. My dad got a part time job stocking but the issue is neither of my parents make the right financial decisions and he will spend his money frivolously. Right now I’m paying all of the utilities which amount to about 320 a month but the estate is going to reimburse me once the estate account is opened. Im also saving money because I know for a fact he will not have 4 grand saved up at the end of the year to pay for property taxes. So about 650 all together a month for all expenses

My mom always took care of all of the finances and I feel like my dad will lose everything if he doesn’t have someone hold his hand. The reason I haven’t moved out is because during nursing school I won’t be able to work much and I don’t want to fail out from trying to overload myself. At the same time, I don’t want to be guilt tripped if he can’t manage his money and pay his share of the bills. My mom says I should stick it out because it will be more to live on my own, which might be true because I live in md dmv area which is very high cost of living. It stresses me out because I want to save money but it seems like he always needs something. Also, I feel bad at the same time like I’m abandoning him if I move out.

personalfinance,Paying Off Debt - How to Fix My Credit?,"I  filed for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy back in 2017, and it was discharged in 2018. During the process, I reaffirmed my car lease since I needed it for work. However, I ended up returning the car and was left owing a few thousand dollars.

Now, I’m in a position to pay the full amount I owe (no discount on the principal), but I want to see if it’s possible to negotiate with them to update my account history and mark all those months as “current.” This issue is tanking my credit score, which was already badly hurt from the BK.

personalfinance,new balance transfer or interest-only HELOC?,"In 2023 I bought a roof & fence. Half of this was via interest-only HELOC at 8.5% (10 years interest only, if it matters). The other half I paid for with credit card convenience checks at 0% interest for 15 months with the idea of not accruing interest right away the way I did with the HELOC portion. Used an existing credit card with an offer, didn't open a new account.   
  
I have been paying what I can towards that 0% card while being more aggressive with paying the 8.5% HELOC interest and principal.

But that 15 month 0% APR is expiring, the high CC rates will kick in, and I don't have any existing CCs with a 0% or low % for transfer. Plus the transfer fees are 4-5% of the balance, which could be up to $750 with the $15k I'm looking to move.

**Am I better off:**   
1. getting a new credit card with a 0% balance transfer offer and playing this game for another year WHILE dinging my credit score and paying the transfer fee. 

2. using HELOC funds at 8.5% to pay off the credit card and put the balance on the HELOC. This was my original plan all along, but wondered if there were better options.

Now that its matured an edward jones employee contacted us and said we should put it back in a 6 month CD at 4.2%, or into a money market account (no FDIC insurance.)

Nearly 100% of my savings have been put into index funds or stocks so keeping this money lower risk seems smart. We will max out Roth IRA contributions this year regardless.

We do not need liquidity, but it seems like locking it away in a CD, or putting it slightly more at risk in a money market account are both worse options than a high yield savings account. We also just took out a HELOC loan at 7.2%, going up to 8.5% that is about 1/6th of the life insurance payout.

Is the CD smart because rates are about to drop a lot?

Is there someplace that gives a bonus payout or startup payout for moving 6 figures in?

Is paying off the HELOC the smartest move since 8ish% is higher than 4ish%?

Are there smart questions im not asking?

My concern is that my dog needs surgery and I will be paying between $6000-$8000, so I will likely need to take a loan to pay for it. The surgery is completely non negotiatable for me.

My options are:

1) Use my entire savings to pay for as much of the surgery as possible.

2) Pay off my car and use the remainder of my savings to pay as much of the surgery as possible and take a loan for the rest.

3) Don't pay off the car, pay half the surgery, and take a loan for the remainder.

I'm leaning very heavily to number 3. I'm very hesitant to drain my savings, especially since I will be needing to move out in February and need the money as a security deposit. Absolute worst case scenario is that I need to stay where I am. I am only moving because I hate my neighbors (shouting as I typing this).

I can possibly slash my expenses down to the absolute bare minimum along with doing 10-20hrs overtime weekly, however I will likely also be draining my mental health severely by doing so and now is not a good time with other things going on in my life, not least of which my injured dog.

personalfinance,I’ve Screwed Myself Over,"Long story short, this year has been horrendous. My dad died, my grandma died, my cat died, my SIL has cancer, my income dropped, one roommate moved for work and just stopped paying, and another I had to kick out because it was not good, and I was being taken advantage of (trying to help a friend who needed a place). I have fallen so behind on my bills, and I’m just not sure what else to do. I have a decent income (~$100k) but I’m so late on my payments that it seems impossible to catch up. I’m current on my mortgage, HOA, and utilities. I’m behind on all debt payments (which total $64k—about $3k behind). I had already worked out hardship plans but still can’t afford those. I have two side hustles but have been so depressed that I haven’t been able to motivate myself to work on them… I’ve already ruined my credit… it was 843 and now it’s 476. Should I try to catch up or declare bankruptcy? Do I have any other options? 

Edited with numbers:
Monthly take home pay, after 22% is taken out for my pension, which is the minimum I can have taken out: $5,406, but I’ve lost about $1,500 a month for 5/7 of the last months
Mortgage/Home Ins./Property Tax: $2,806 (rent is about $300-400 a month cheaper where I live if I were to sell and stay in same area, one of the cheapest where I live)

Eating Out: $350
Pets: $100
Misc: $100 (hair cut, makeup, feminine products, clothes, etc)
Roth: $400 (on pause currently) 

It doesn’t look scary until you factor in that I have missed pay significantly more than usual this year due to everything going on in my life, so you can see how I got behind on credit cards. 

Here are my debts:
Credit Cards: $52,000, minimums: $1,300, interest: 6-10% (I’ve negotiated this twice)
Personal Loan: $9,000, minimum: $330, interest: 8%

I’m 3 months behind in a week, so about $5,000. More than I thought 😩

As far as family goes, I don’t have any help or support. My dad had a will, according to what he told me the night before he passed, but when I ask my step mom about it she won’t answer me and literally changes the subject (I finally asked if he left me literally anything—even just a tshirt or a massage gun, and she still avoids answering). It’s on my list to call a probate attorney, but I literally have no clue what the deal is. It’s hard to imagine he didn’t leave me anything; he and I were super close, and he was a surgeon, but my step mom is… interesting? She and her sister are still fighting over their mom’s will, and her mom passed 5 years ago. I don’t really know anything beyond that. The lawyers I’ve talked to all said I can write a note to include in my file if I declare bankruptcy. 

I am usually really good with money and super motivated. I worked 3 jobs for 12 years to pay off student loans and then saved another $85k to buy a house on a conventional loan in a high cost of living state to be close to my family. Prior to this happening, I had never had an overdraft on my bank account and never paid a bill late. I know how to get out of debt, but I guess I just don’t know what else to do to get caught back up. I’m burnt out and depressed (don’t worry too much—I have multiple degrees in this area and know what I need to do). I’ll get there, but I’m thick in the grief process right now, and this isn’t helping. I had a 3 month emergency fund, but I ended up going through that when I was roommateless. I would prefer NOT to rent out my spare bedroom. I have had the worst experiences this year.

I have talked to my financial planners, and they recommend bankruptcy if I can qualify for a chapter 7. I would keep my house and car according to laws in my state. I don’t anticipate needing credit for anything in the near future as I already have a house and reliable vehicle; honestly, at this point, I think my credit would be fixed faster if I did either form of bankruptcy. At least bankruptcy would restructure everything and get me caught up. I obviously am torn about doing this since I keep delaying it and trying to figure out another way—including here. I feel like such a failure.

ANOTHER EDIT: I COULD pull $5k from my Roth IRA to catch up and take the tax hit (I got a big refund last year). Ugh. IDK!

Attached is the medical and prescription coverage:

(Base PPO/HDHP)

Deductible: 3500/2500

max out of pocket: 6350/6350

coinsurance: 30%/20%

PCP Visits: 35 Copay/20% after deductible

Specialist Visits: 60 Copay/20% after deductible

Impatient: 30% after deductible/20% after deductible

Outpatient: 30% after deductible/20% after deductible

ER: 400 Copay/20% after deductible

Urgent Care: $75 Copay/20% after deductible

Prescriptions: \[$15/$40/$75\] / 20% after deductible

I guess the only other thing to note is that my employer will attribute $400 into the HSA w/ the HDHP plan.

personalfinance,Getting divorced. Need help with the split.,"My wife and I are slowly, amicably planning our divorce at the end of this year.

I need help with ideas on how to do this split.

Background:

Married 17 years. We've contributed to my retirement SEP IRAs, but she has a school counselor job which will not bear fruit in retirement (came to it late).

We have about $950k in various IRAs. We have a house we paid $239k in 2007 at top of the market. I have a previous house that is a rental worth about $165k. We owe about $225 total on both houses. I make about $201k/year, plus $25k-40k extra by working my vacation time. She makes about $60k.

I'm keeping the houses. She wants to get an apartment and work out her three-year contract, then move and purchase a house closer to family and friends.

She doesn't want the houses, but suggested $300k cash, and $1000/month alimony for five years. I agreed.

Here is my problem -- how do I give her $300k cash without taking a tax penalty for removing it from an IRA? I can borrow against my $275k in my TSP (government IRA). I can take home equity loans against the houses.

Ideas? I know we need a financial advisor, a lawyer, or both in order to navigate the tax problems here.

personalfinance,Child tax credit versus living expenses for additional person in household,"Edit #2- question resolved. Thx so much u/Its-a-write-off!!!



Question/opinions comparing which is more beneficial for us and current family situation. My husband’s adult son (currently in college) moved in with us full time this past January 2024. He use to be split 50/50 with his mother. My husband and his mom would alternate the child tax credit each year as well. Last year was my husband’s turn to claim for 2023 tax year, however the mother was upset due to reportedly having several expenses that were not split and wanted to claim the tax credit. Husband wanted an itemized invoice in order to split those costs instead of giving up claiming the child on his taxes that year.

Fast forward to present day. Since the kid lives with us full time, I am not sure if fair to continue alternating child tax credits. I could be incorrect so feel free to point that out (nicely). The kid is on the mom/step-dad’s insurance though he also has healthcare through Native American Tribe. They also pay for his cell phone service. We cover his car insurance, gas money, and the regular increase in utilities/food when adding another person to a household.

How would I go about comparing the increase in our costs versus what we would gain or lose with the child tax credit? Thx for any info!

EDIT: My apologies for my major confusion! Step-son too old for child tax credit and both sets of parents (mom & step-dad OR dad & step-mom) aren't single so Head of Household doesn't seem to apply.   Assume that means the step-child can be claimed as a dependent since under 24 and full time student, but how much of a benefit is that?",1731975503.0
personalfinance,Mortgage recast questions,"Under contract on a home planning on initial 20% down on a conventional 30 year mortgage. I have an inherited IRA sitting earmarked to be used for the house. Caveat is that I had an unusually high tax burden this year, so that’s money cannot be withdrawn until 2025 without an excessive tax hit. Tentative closing date is mid December.

Brought up the idea of recasting with our lender and they were very unclear/avoidant. They mentioned there is no way to guarantee we can recast, there may be a timeframe to recast which they couldn’t specify (ex. wait 6 months, which is fine with us), and there is nothing in writing from lenders that would specify conditions of a recast.

I want to put this money right onto principle next year and reamortize (to clarify we can afford the higher mortgage, but want to recast to have a lower burden month to month). Is this lender jerking me around? Why wouldn’t I be able to recast? Shouldn’t be able to find some kind of terms and conditions on this from the lender?

personalfinance,Refund sent to closed card?  Bank and merchant both not taking responsibility.,"Hi all, thanks in advance for your help and advice.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this on, but my situation is as follows:

On Sept 28 I paid for something.  On October 14, I closed the account/debit card that I used to make that purchase.  On October 21, I was issued a surprise refund for my original payment, and the refund went to the now-closed card I paid with originally.

I have been on this month long back and forth between the merchant and my bank, trying to get the refunded money sent to an active account.  The problem is, the merchant no longer has the funds they sent out for my refund, and the bank has no record of those funds arriving.  In other words, the merchant doesn't have the money and neither does the bank--the funds didn't even bounce once they reached the closed debit card.  Every time I contact the merchant, they tell me to contact the bank to return the funds.  Every time I contact the bank, they tell me to contact the merchant because they can't even file a dispute on funds that don't exist.  I am out of ideas on what else to do or who else to call; I'm expecting a call from merchant leadership in a few days to try and discuss the matter further, but does anyone have any idea on what I can do to get this sorted out?  I have copies of the bank statement showing that the funds didn't arrive, and I have a copy of the refund statement saying the funds were sent.  I just have no idea who I can hold responsible for this problem since everyone is pointing fingers, or what I can say to them to make someone take this seriously and figure out where the money went.

personalfinance,Advice on tricky situation,"I hope this makes sense because it’s a convoluted situation. 

A retired F recently got divorced and had her son buy her ex out of 43% of their home. The son got a mortgage at almost 50% of his income, is living in the home and she’s currently renting a unit from another son but is only paying 1/2 of the rent because she only makes 2k in SS a month. So the other son has to cover the rest. 

The first son wants his mom to do a buy back and sell him and his GF the rest of the house for a monthly payment for the next 15-20 years. They can’t afford to get a loan for the remainder of the house. So if she doesn’t agree they need to sell the house. 

A few of us think this situation is a terrible idea but it’s such an emotional situation that no one is listening to reason and the first son obviously is trying to do whatever he can to keep the house which is way more than they can afford. 

My questions are the following:

- would this make sense at all to keep the house?
- what problems do you see with such an arrangement? 
- what is the best way out of this?

I feel like I know what everyone is going to say but as I’m not a pro in real estate or finance I need more information to show them the pitfalls of this arrangement.

For background, I am getting serious with my girlfriend and she has expressed that I should start taking my (soon to be our) personal finances more seriously. We were having a relationship logistics talk and when we get on the topic of finances she is typically not satisfied with how I manage them (I don't). I've basically lived on pure impulse and things mostly pan out. I don't educate myself much outside my work and personal interests and don't know where to begin to put a plan together. Listed below are some of the problem areas we have identified together.

1. Budget - Don't have one, don't need one. I know how much I have coming in every month and I just spend less than that. This has been my strategy since I turned 18 and I have never rethought it (Im 31). The surplus gets saved to a savings account. I have 3 months of all my expenses saved.

2. Investing - All dollars above the 3 months expenses get split in two. My good friend built a ""trade bot"" that tells him how to buy stocks. Not sure how it works, I'm not that kind of engineer, He built the bot and I fronted the money for him to test it. So far its done well? There is more in there than the sum of all my deposits so I assume thats good. She asked me how its doing against the market? She thinks the trade bot and the fact shes never met this friend are sketchy and wants me to put it in a ""normal"" investment account. The other half I use to buy project cars. As I hobby I purchase and restore old cars. I can perform a full frame off restoration including electrical, paint, uphostlery and engine work in my shop.  I keep the ones I like and sell the ones I dont have space for. I love it and if we are being honest it was unironically my only investment ""plan"" when I was single. Old Mercs and Bimmers turn a good profit if you are not paying for the labor.

3. House - I bought a house in Massachusetts some time ago and have been renting out for about 7 years now. Really not sure what to do next. Its managed by a property manager and I have not seen it since I left 7 years ago. I don't know what to do with it and she thinks I should know what to do with it?



I am not lazy and I do have the desire to figure out how to be financially literate. I just dont know where to start.

personalfinance,1099 Misclassification + Owed Paycheck = What Kind of Outcome?,"Hello,

To be quick and to the point as I am on my way out -

I worked for an LLC for several years as an independent contractor (1099). I found out the final year that I have been misclassified as a 1099 the entirety of working there. I got testy with my ""job requirements"" and was fired. I have yet to receive a final owed paycheck. So far I have really only lightly researched potentially charging interest owed for the paycheck, as well as pursuing legal action towards the company to recoup funds for prior taxes. I also have began reaching out to Attorney's in my area.

This feels like such a daunting issue with a lot of unknowns on my part. I want to receive the most compensation I possibly can - as I owed thousands each year for taxes (didn't learn how to do my taxes efficiently until the final year either 🙄😅), and I just feel generally pissed off about being treated like a W2 without the benefits.

Just a small side comment - I was the youngest contractor working for the company, working with people twice my age who also likely do not know they were/are being misclassified.... better learning all of this late, but not double my age late, is definitely a positive from my perspective.

I'd like to hear from fellow Redditor's who have had similar experiences, what you did, anything you would have done differently? And what the outcome was. Any friendly recommendations and guidance are welcome.

personalfinance,Fixed income in inherited Roth.,"I am 62 and semi-retired with a low income and spread-out investments.

I recently inherited a Roth (non-spousal) which has to be closed about 8 years. It comprises about 4% of my portfolio. Right now it is in FFRHX which I guess I would consider fixed income because my parent used these dividends to pay specific expenses.  I could certainly use it to pay my healthcare premiums. If I did that I realize there will be very little tax-free growth, but I will have guaranteed coverage of an important expense.

personalfinance,Unwinding Large Investment in Single Stock (Retired 72M & 72F),"Not sure if this belongs here, r/investing, r/personalfinance, or r/retirement

  
I retired 2 years ago at 70 and sold my small business for 7 figures.  I hold a 4% note and am collecting 10% of gross revenue (around 100k per year), the bulk of which is categorized as LTCG.  

For reasons I won't go into, my IRA with Schwab was not funded over past 2 decades the way it should have been, so I am currently sitting on 'only' about $450K in that account.  I was too busy running the business and spending earnings to think about retirement and investment strategies (belatedly remedied by reading r/bogleheads etc.)  

About 8 years ago I took some investing 'play money' and bought quite a bit of TSLA.  That stock is in an after-tax investment account and is worth, as of today, right at $680,000. 

My quandary is this:  How do I unwind from that single stock so I can move the money into bonds and index funds to pad my retirement income?  Clearly, holding such a large percentage of my net worth  ($2.8M) in a single stock is extremely risky.  Obviously, I could just bite the bullet and sell the bulk of the stock, either all at once or over months/years, but would pay 20% capital gains on the sale.  And that would also put me in a high tax bracket as well as affect things like social security IRMMA.

We currently have a 20 year mortgage, with 17 years left to pay. Interest rate is 2.875%; balance is $158,000; payment is $1,000. (This does not include our taxes/insurance)

We have a HELOC with a $46,000 balance at 7.75%. We have interest only payments right now of about $300. 

We wanted to roll the HELOC into a new mortgage and refinance down to a 12 year mortgage to cut five years off our loan. Total payment would be about $2000 with a rate of 6.25%. However, I’m wondering if we should just pay extra on one of the loans because our current mortgage rate is so low. If we go this route, is it better to pay extra on the HELOC? Or our Mortgage? 

I’m hoping rates will come down next year, like everyone else of course. Maybe combine the two loans when/if rates ever get down to 4.5-5%.

I am recently retired and live alone in a 2020 year model RV.  I support myself with a pension I earned from the state, over the course of 35 years.  It is a modest pension; enough to barely cover my monthly expenses.

I chose this lifestyle (full-time RV living), because it best suits my needs at the present, and I need to have the ability to move locations on short notice.

The RV I am in now, I bought in 2021.  It's present worth is about $29,000 retail, and I have paid the loan down to $28,500.  APR is 7.19%.  I needed low monthly payments when I first financed, and am afraid that I am going to be upside down soon on this loan.  This RV also no longer fits my lifestyle and needs.  

My situation has changed and I have enough money to make some sweeping changes.   I want to purchase a ""new-to-me"" RV, which I will live in probably for another 4 or five years, after which time, I see myself settling down stationary.  

RVs I am looking at moving into run in the low to mid 40s ($41K to $46K).  Because I cannot sell my present RV without having a place to live, my thought is to pay off the loan on my current RV, thus avoiding the high monthly interest, purchase my new RV for cash, outright, move from the old RV into the new one, and then fix up and sell the old one.  While I will no longer be paying interest, the old RV will continue to depreciate in value while I own it, and there will be insurance and storage costs associated, until it sells.

Another concern is having $75K in cash tied up in two RVs.

So... opinions whether this is the best path for my situation, or should I buy the newer RV outright, and maintain payments on the loan on the old RV, until it sells and the loan can be satisfied.

I'd like to think I have a good understanding of budgeting/planning for finances etc. Regardless of the backstory of 70k debt, I am looking for ways to get out of this. I haven't been able to financially contribute too much in the last three years given I was pregnant and then on mat leave in Canada, which pays 55% of your salary. I also took that time to get my MBA, which further put us into debt.

Im done with th3 MBA and I now have a good job that pays well, my husband and I make roughly 18k month after taxes.

70k is mostly high interest creditcards. Other than debt relief, is there anything I can do to pay these down. LOC isn't an option since our credit isn't that great given our high debt, I am little lost.

  
Edit: I realized that I have given a very incomplete picture of my situation but what I was really looking for are the tips/tricks to pay this down quickly. Here is the context: we have dual citizenship, we had kids in Canada, so I could take advantage of one year long maternity leave for each of my kid, which I did. So, I was on 55% Canadian income for 2 years, we did put our expenses on the cards, which clearly has racked up now. I am now working in the US, and this money is earned in the US, our gross pay is actually $28k per month but our expenses are quite HIGH. 

Mortgage: $3900, Child care: $5500, Bills: $1200, Cars: $1800, Side business: $1500 all stated in USD, after all this, we are left with $4k per month, all of which will go to the creditcards but what I was really looking for was ways I can expediate the pay-off.

So I was a teacher a few years back and accured around $12k in the South Carolina Retirement System through PEBA. I know the general wisdom is to always rollover those savings into a 401k or IRA, but in this case, it could mean the difference between buying a home vs renting a year or two sooner and potentially being able to make a move when the market is more optimal. As I figure with the hefty tax penalties, I'd probably leave with $7.5k to $8k. This would allow us to put a down payment down while also still keeping our buffer savings (we have nearly 3 months of income each). We both make around $51k yearly and each have a car payment for the next 4 years of around $400 each.

Trying to decide between a HDHP with an HSA and $0 Deductible plan.  When I add up the estimated copayment and deductibles on each plan the $0 deductible plan wins out by only a few $$.  Even though the $0 deductible premium would be significantly more expensive than the HDHP premium.     If the out of pocket expenses are almost a wash, and the premium expenses are not paid by me,  then the tax benefit of the HSA makes the HDHP plan a better deal right?

personalfinance,Saving for college or a future home and retirement?,"My kids are growing up fast and we have been investing on their behalf. I am looking down the road and it's clear that it is much easier to get a loan for college than a mortgage. Loans for college are also generally low interest. There shouldn't be a need to pay them off right away, and they can be deferred if the student is in a graduate program. That said, many families seek to pay tuition upfront or pay off the loans asap. 

I imagine my kids going to a 4 year college and following up with graduate school. This means that they wouldn't be in the job market until they are nearly 30 and they wouldn't need to start making payments on their loans until then. In the meantime, I can continue to invest on their behalf, growing their $15k accounts to $150k by that time. 

They will emerge on the job market with $150k that will help buffer their transition to work-life. They can buy a house - at least here in the Midwest - and start building equity asap. Sure, they will still have loan payments, and mortgage payments, but they will also have a nest egg that is growing at 8% interest that will compete against their 3% student loan. It will also allow me to keep principal in the market instead of the school's bank account. 

I'll have more money to help my kids out in their 30's and beyond. In the end, it seems like we should hold our money in the market as long as possible and let our kids pursue whatever education they want, preferably deferring payment while in graduate school so they can maximize their earnings in their professional life.

personalfinance,I Made a Series of Financial Mistakes and Lost Everything—Looking for Advice to Start Over,"

Hi, everyone.
I never thought I'd be in a position where I’d be asking strangers for advice, but here I am. Over the past two years, my life has completely unraveled, and I’m struggling to figure out how to pick up the pieces.

It all started during the pandemic. I was doing okay financially, working a steady job and saving little by little. But when the stock market dipped, I thought I saw an opportunity to grow my savings quickly. I went all in—everything I had—on a few individual stocks, ignoring the warnings about diversification. At first, things looked promising, but as the market shifted, I realized too late that I didn’t know what I was doing. I lost nearly my entire savings, around $25,000, which was everything I had worked for.

To make matters worse, my marriage began falling apart during this time. The financial stress, combined with other personal issues, became too much. My wife left and took our 5-year-old daughter with her. I don’t blame her—I wasn’t the person she married anymore.

Now, I’m living paycheck to paycheck, trying to make ends meet. I rent a tiny studio apartment, and my credit card debt is piling up because I can’t keep up with basic expenses. I’m drowning and feel like I’ve let everyone, including myself, down.

I know I made mistakes, and I’m not looking for pity. What I really need is advice. How do I start over when I’ve hit rock bottom?

Here’s where I stand:

    Income: $2,800/month after taxes
    Rent: $1,200/month
    Credit Card Debt: $9,000 at 22% APR
    No savings, no investments, no retirement accounts
    Skills: Basic office work, but no degree

I’m open to any suggestions—whether it’s budgeting, side gigs, negotiating debt, or just emotional advice on how to stay hopeful. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you climb out of it?

Thank you for reading. I appreciate any guidance you can offer.",1731956498.0
personalfinance,"Got my first job, how to allocate $ to reach my goals?","Hi everyone I am a 22 year old recent college grad who just got my first job and am seeking to learn more on investing given my goals. 

I have been into personal finance for about 3 years now, but have more so been watching from the sidelines and learning since I haven’t had much income. With this being my first job I should now be able to actually invest consistently and am interested in recommendations on allocations given my goals.

I currently have about $9,000 in a brokerage $7,000 in my Roth, and $3,000 in an HYSA. My car is paid off and I have no debt.

I start my job next month and I’ll make about $90,000 before taxes and deductions. The plan is to contribute 401k and HSA only up to max matching (3% salary and $400 for HSA).

After deductions and taxes I’ll take home around $5,400 per month. I live with my mom and will pay half expenses so expenses will only come out to around $2,000 - $2,300 per month. 

$583 of my income after expenses will certainly go to my Roth so I can max it each year. However, how should I allocate the remaining ~ $2400? I do plan on building my HYSA to more than $3,000. Besides that, should the remainder go to my brokerage, should I increase 401-K/HSA contribution, or continue putting more $ into my HYSA? Are there any other investment tools I should learn about?

As far as my goals go, I would like to move out of home within 2-3 years. I want to eventually purchase a home as well. I’m also interested in starting/buying a cpa firm at some point in the future when I’m ready (probably in 7-10 years). 

I’d be happy to provide any additional information if needed, and would greatly appreciate any advice for my situation. ",1731956391.0
personalfinance,I’m an idiot who contributed to a tIRA while making more than the income limit. What should I do?,"I (32M) just paid off a ton of tax debt and was focused on maxing out my retirement accounts for the first time in my life. I will make 40k from a W-2 job (substitute teacher) and 70K from 1099 gig work. I am covered by a retirement plan for the W-2 (CALSTRS, which is a 401(a) defined benefit plan where 10% of my W-2 paycheck is placed into a pretax retirement account). 

I opened my first tIRA this year and was planning on maxing it out. After I already contributed 2K, I read a post on this sub about the tIRA income limits. If I am above the income limits and I’m covered by an employer retirement plan (which is true for my W-2 income at least) I am worried my 2K tIRA contributions will not be tax deductible.

I believe my only recourse is to convert the 2K via a backdoor Roth and consider a Solo 401(K) for my 1099 income but I wanted to get this sub’s opinion first. Any information is appreciated!",1731954810.0

Basically I'm about halfway through a loan for my car and it's worth about 4k with a payoff of 12k, got an insane interest rate when I got the car (26%) due to an old repo that has now been paid in full. all payments on time but principal hasn't moved and when I tried to talk to the bank they basically said my loan is setup to make me pay 100% of the interest before my principal moves at all. 
Car is 2013 Kia soul with engine recall and am super anxious about motor blowing up and me being completely fucked. (No GAP, I know it's horrible) What are my options with this loan? Really looking to get a new vehicle and it seems the ev tax credit can help with negative equity. Unfortunately credit score hasn't really changed since I got this loan. But my total debt has most definitely decreased by about 6-7k income is basically the same as when I got the car around 40-50k per year. Payment is 450 and am able and willing to have a higher payment. (700-800 is totally doable) No down payment money available. Possibly a consignor available.

personalfinance,To refinance or sell my car?,"So I have a loaded 2023 Tundra Limited that I bought in January of 23 with a 4 year loan and not that much down. My payments are $1223/month as I wanted to pay it off quickly. I did a budget before the purchase 2 years ago and it'd be tighter then my wife and I have run the budget before but we decided to go for it. Fast forward to nearly 2 years into the loan, I have $30,500 left on it, and the payments are causing issues with the household budget and are stressing the marriage. Value private sale is maybe $50,000 if I can find a buyer in this market. Trade in $48,000ish if I'm lucky. Carmax will give me $46,000 for it. 

If I refinance to a new 4 year loan from now it drops my payments for $1223 to $717 or so but the interest restarts. My CURRENT loan has a 5.49% rate and 2/3'rds of the interest is already paid. A new loan would probably be 6.5-6.79%. 

Alternatively I work more, get a 2nd job or just pick up hours at work. I work in an extremely taxing and stressful profession. My marriage is strained already for a couple reasons, finances being one, work stress (both of our jobs are very stressful), among other things. 

I'm not super keen on working more due to the stress that will put on me and the marriage but I need to figure something out as it was a BIG mistake to buy this years ago and the financial stress is really not good either. 

Do people think I should:

1. Refinance it? Saves paying Sales Tax again, pay a lot more interest. Drop payment by $500-ish for a 48 mo loan or $600 for a 60 month loan. I'd end up paying roughly $3500 more in interest then I'd pay just finishing out my current loan.

2. Trade it in for a cheaper vehicle? I could wheel and deal, trading it in keeps me from paying sales tax again. I could find something for a $500/mo payment or less ideally. 

3. Buckle down and work overtime like crazy to pay it off sooner? OR pick up a couple extra shifts a month to pay for the truck. It's not great either way, one way is 13 weeks of working 3 extra 12 hour shifts a week on top of my 3x12 hour regular shifts. I'd be a walking zombie as I'm already super tired and burnt out after 3x12's for a couple days, but it'd be paid off by next spring. This sounds terrible but I think the marriage would tolerate that better then a few extra shifts a month over the next 2 years which would prolong the fatigue and stress over a longer period of time. 

  
Sadly I do REALLY want a pickup truck, as my wife and I really like going out in to the wilderness to camp and it's super helpful with the dogs as well as for DIY home projects that we are both into but currently can't afford since the truck payment. The truck I have now has everything I'd ever want in one but I just should've done a 7 year loan and made extra payments OR just bought an old beater and not had a payment.

  
What does the collective think?

personalfinance,Preserving wealth while funding a large expense ,"My thought process with this plan stems from what I’ve learned from wealthy people - Use other peoples money when you can (in this case the bank).

Quick run down on my scenario: me 38m, wife 32. Our combined income from day jobs $240k, rental income $36k year net, other income $100k yr. Assets - 401k $455k, IRA’s $246k, Brokerage $50k, crypto $332k, HYSA $80k.

We are planning a major home remodel next year that we’ve budgeted $400k for. We have HELOC’s on our rentals to be able to cover this expense. My grand plan is to ride this current crypto wave and look to cash out the bulk of it around April of next year. Would transition crypto assets over to brokerage. Goal is to have $500k in brokerage invested in blue chip equities. Instead of paying for the remodel with cash / investments, I’d look to use the HELOC initially. Once I have my target amount in brokerage I’d sell covered calls off the portfolio to make monthly payments to the HELOC. Also would use our side income source to pay down the HELOC balance. Goal would be to have the full remodel cost paid off over a three year period. The whole purpose of this is to not deplete too much of our liquid assets, and benefit from the tax advantages with the heloc (tax write offs). 

Does this seem reasonable, or am I way off course here?",1731955352.0
personalfinance,Help: 401K vs. Saving for a House?,"**Question**: Is it irresponsible/unwise to **temporarily** lower HSA and 401K contributions to save for a house in my current situation?  I know the common advice to never touch this--is this a situation where it makes sense to do this?  Conservatively (i.e., not counting any bonuses) if I stopped contributing for 3 years, I would have as much saved as I wanted to have for down payment + reserved savings.  More likely (i.e., based on low-end of bonuses previously received) if I stopped contributing for 2 years, I would have as much as I wanted to have saved.  Add 2 years to each time estimate with no change to contributions.

**Sorry in advance for the long post...really just don't know what to do.  Any and all advice/experience is greatly appreciated.**

**Current Situation**:  In a HCOL area.  Max out HSA and 401K IRS contribution limits; save/invest 27-30% of monthly budget + all stock grants/bonuses; rent is 25% of monthly budget; student loans are 13% of monthly budget; car payment 7% of monthly budget.  ""Monthly budget"" = 2 paychecks, post-tax/withholdings/HSA/401K contributions, so there are 2 ""extra"" paychecks per year that are saved/invested/put towards student loans.  Stock grants and bonuses after taxes = about 18% of annual salary and are saved/invested/put towards student loans.  Don't carry a balance on credit cards. 

I support both myself and my spouse, who hasn't had success job hunting/hasn't had steady employment to reliably contribute to shared recurring expenses since getting an MBA.  Goal is to pay essentially all expenses with one salary (my salary for now or forever, tbd).  We want children in the next year, so  goal would be to save most of my spouse's future income/use it to pay for childcare, or if spouse is unemployed, they'll be the primary caregiver even though that's not exactly what we want/planned.

Like so many others, I've been saving but cost of the houses/areas we're interested in have run up faster than I could save over the past couple years.  Prices are starting to normalize a bit, but they're still quite high.  It seems that we won't be able to have an affordable monthly payment without putting at 20% down, given the interest rates and increasing home insurance costs (plus high property taxes in our area).  

Our apartment is well-priced, but the location is beginning to wear on us (me especially).  My new car has dents and scratches from other careless tenants parking crooked in the lot and hitting whoever is next to them with their car door, there's been a notable increase in crime in the area in the past year, hallways constantly smell like weed and garbage, terrible to go for walks as it's on a main commercial road, and it's hard for me to justify paying more for a 2BR apartment with these conditions. At that point, I'd rather ""go for broke"" and really stretch our budget just to have some peace and be paying into an asset (but I won't actuallyyy do that, hence wanting to beef up down payment/reserve savings...).  The school system in our current town is also not good, but the towns around us where we'd like to buy are excellent.  Also, if my spouse does find employment, we would want to employ an au pair for childcare, which would require being able to provide them with at least their own room, if not their own bathroom.  If we have kids while renting, we will need to pay for daycare which can be more expensive than au pairs in our area, and will also make it more difficult to continue being a 1-car family (which we want to be).   

**Other Info**: I'm pretty disciplined when I create a savings goal--there's really no ""fear"" that I'd plan to save money and that I'd end up spending it.  I don't like the idea of borrowing from my 401K for a down payment because of the rules about paying it back and how changing jobs could affect paying it back.  ",1731955296.0

personalfinance,Should I Cash Out My Pension To Expand Rental Portfolio In Seattle?,"Hi everyone, I’m seeking advice on a financial decision I’m considering. I’m 37 years old and currently own two rental properties in the Seattle area.

Right now, my pension payout is projected to be $525/month when I retire. My concern is that inflation will erode its value significantly over the next few decades. Instead, I’m thinking of parking those funds in a rental property, which might appreciate and generate cash flow that keeps pace with inflation.

I got a new accountant  because of this and some other unprofessional behavior from my first one, and he is suggesting I submit a late s corp election for 2024 to save a little bit on taxes, and since I’ve honestly been operating similarly to one for years. 

I have paid $20k so far in federal and state taxes, and I guess my question is how much would I owe will I owe in taxes (a rough estimate obviously!) I am an extremely money anxious person and I didn’t grow up in a family making a lot, so I just feel completely lost. I have a lot saved for taxes, I’m just so scared it’s not going to be enough. I have another appointment with my accountant coming up so I can’t ask him all these questions then, but I just need help easing my anxiety until then because it’s all I can’t think about and it’s becoming all consuming for me if I’m being honest. 

For context my expenses are totaling around $65,000 for the year and I live in Arizona. I’ve paid $18,000 so far in taxes. 

Could anyone give me an idea of what I would owe still in total (self employment, federal, state) if I filed as an LLC, and if I filed as an s corp? I know getting the s corp back filed for the year isn’t guaranteed so I’m just trying to prepare myself especially with the holidays coming up. I’m anticipating around $30k but I don’t know if that’s accurate at all. 

I’m also planning a wedding for next year and I’m the main bread winner by a lot so I’m just freaking out a bit, so I’m sorry if I sound nervous!!! Thank you so much in advance. ",1731952908.0

personalfinance,Pensions: why does NPV / FV matter?,"You should comfortably be able to withdraw 4% without affecting the principal significantly.  A $50K/yr pension has a value of FV of $1,250,000: pension amount / 4%. However, why does this matter at all? 

It’s not actually worth remotely close to that -there is no real value except for the $50K. You don’t pass on anything when you die. I understand NPV, but then again, having the cash equivalent is no comparison as it is far better than a pension.

I make pre-tax 140k a year based on my last tax statement. He *was* making less than 50k a year. Our rent is 3.6k (he was paying about 1600 of it), credit card bills are pretty low (I sensed some change coming and wanted to be prepared to took out some RSUs to pay down debt just in case)...live in a HCOL area so im hoping we can attempt to move in a year or so. My car payments are done in January (currently 173, 2x a month). We have 2 pets but no kids. Pets are pretty low maintenance in terms of costs, we've got their food on a recurring schedule for delivery that works and they dont have any major health issues.

  
I've got probably around 2k in personal stock investments and a LOT (like 60k+) of un-vested RSUs from work that will come my way over the course of the next 2 years. The unvested RSUs are whats keeping me feeling too sick about the long term impact of a small money period. I know anything could happen but id say im like 90% job secure at any given point in time.

  
We're already kind of homebodies, don't really drink. Our ""vices"" are probably subscription services for things like clothes (i am very attached to my monthly clothing rental, helps curb my online shopping habits and makes me feel a little better about clothing consumption), streaming services, and takeout. Takeout has already been almost entirely eliminated (however now with his free time we take a morning walk 3-4 times a week and grab a coffee).

long time lurker, first time poster. 

Im currently 23, almost 24, and am looking for suggestions to improve my personal investments. Considering I’m young and I still live with my family, I’m not all too worried about taking some higher risk since I fortunately don’t have too many overhead expenses at the moment.

~30k in pure stocks mostly focusing on tech (apple, microsoft, nvidia, amazon, etc) and am currently up ~15%

personalfinance,"Budgeting advice, 20 yo ","I just turned 20, I came to the US 8 months ago with my family. I’m currently in the path of literally building my life. At the moment I could land job that pays the bills and I’m living with my family. But I have some goals for my future however they are a little hard to achieve. I’m just asking for a realistic budgeting advice.

Goals (ordered in time needed to acomplish)
1-Get my green card ($1450+)
2-Marry my current partner and bring her to the US (later on that)
3-Study and graduate as an electrical engineering (I was studying it back in Cuba)…further on that later

Current salary and expenses:

Monthly (22-23 business days based):

$2300-$2600 
-975 (rent, day-care for my brother, car insurance, etc etc…it’s a fixed amount that my family has to pay the usual bills)
-250–500 (food, electricity bill, gas)
Personal expenses may vary, I usually don’t spend more than 50 monthly, however sometimes I buy stuff for my girlfriend or some stupid gift giving thing at work, so it could go up to 150, but not always.

Further on my goals:
1-the green card should cost around $1450 or may go up a little more, my family is getting some financial help from other relatives so it may vary, but definitely $1450 minimum. 

2-Once I get my green card (I assume could be around august) I want to go to Cuba and marry her, the wedding itself should not be more than 300, we want something simple, the honeymoon could be around 300-400, and the flight to Cuba and back could be around 300-1000 who knows lol, and also I want to go out with her and my friends a little so add 200 more xD. 

After that I want to start all the process for her to get to the us, prices may vary for everything, but definetely we are looking at +$2500 in the whole 1.5-3 years the process could last.

3-Shortly after marrying I want to continue my studies, I want to go 2 years in community college for my associate, and of course asking for student aid, in Miami-Dade College it should not be more than 2k per semester without the financial help. Then I would start with another 2+ years in Florida International University, but who knows if I would have the same job or the same situation.

How to achieve them?

What should I do every time I get paid? How much should I aim to save monthly, I was saving 1200 monthly but at work they told to cut off some of the overtime so I’m now around 800-1000 monthly.

Should I start investing some of that money? At least a little portion? Is there any way to make money online and add up a little? I already feel that I’m behind in my life and my financial situation is horrible, I would be graduating extremely late (I assume 25-26) and I really don’t know how to handle some of the stuff that’s coming

personalfinance,Employer Payroll Not Allowing Me to Reduce My Tax Withholdings By Any Meaningful Amount,"Hi all, I am planning on filing Ch 7 Bankruptcy in Jan or Feb 2025, and my attorney advised me to reduce my tax withholdings as much as possible, because the trustee can take possession of my tax refund as an asset come April tax refund time (for what its worth, my federal tax refund last year was around $2400 and my state refund was around $1200). In other words, I want to have as close to zero tax refund as possible, because the bankruptcy trustee will be able to take it from me. 

My current paycheck withholding is $934 federal and $240 state. Via my employer's online payroll portal, I submitted a new W-4 which literally reduced both federal and state tax withholdings to 0. (Given I only had 4 paychecks left this year when I did this 2 weeks ago, I felt I needed to reduce the withholdings to as close to 0 as possible), in order to align with the estimated total $3600 refund.

However, the paycheck I got this last Friday only had like $10 less withheld! How is it possible to collectively reduce federal and state taxes by $1170, but only had $10 reduction withheld in my paycheck?

I chatted with my employer payroll and they said that my marital status and # of dependents can impact how much the company can legally reduce the withholding for me. FYI I am single and have 0 dependents.

Can anyone shed some light on this and help me out? I want to be confident in my company's payroll, but I feel like they may not know what they are doing.

If I am single and have 0 dependents - and my W-4 is otherwise ""normal"" with no exemptions or anything, is it normal for it to basically be impossible to get any withholding reduction more than a negligible amount (ex. $10....?)

personalfinance,Would you buy a home in my situation or wait?,"I don't know if I should buy a home now or wait.

I am in my early 30's. I currently gross 157k/year. My job is stable. My credit score is 805. I am single, live alone, and my monthly expenses are $2623, no debts. I have 198k in cash. My net is $8589/month, my gross is $13,097. I rent currently at ~$1500/month which will be going up by 5% when I next renew my lease in a few months. I put 6% of my gross into my 401k which my employer matches, I also max out my HSA pre-tax and put 7500 into a Roth IRA post tax every year. I live in a high income tax state so after everything this leaves me with NET of $7964 per month after taxes and retirement contributions.

I am what you would call frugal, though I don't try to be, I just have a hard time spending money. I currently live well beneath my means. I have no debt. My old car is paid off. Not counting my retirement accounts which I will not be touching for any reason for at least 30 years, I currently have 198k cash saved up rolling into 4 week Treasury bills yielding me 4.589%, this is the easily accessible cash on hand I have intended to use 150k of to purchase a home. Keeping the rest for emergency fund and job loss safety net as I have no friends or family in my life to ask for help if anything in my life goes wrong. I am adding $5341 to this pile every month.

The median price for homes in my area is 655k and they seem to be going up by 3-5% per year. Though this year they are the same as they were last year. If I bought the typical home right now putting 131k as the 20% down-payment assuming an 6.5% mortgage, (I assume if i shop around at least 3 mortgage lenders I can get a 6.5% mortgage rate since they are ~7% today) then my monthly payment will be ~$3871. This includes property taxes, homeowners insurance, mortgage interest and principle, and hoa. 

This would put my debt to income at 30%.

A payment of $3871 feels insane to me, and the Amortization schedule of the loan means I'll be paying in total 1.192 million for a 655k house, so I pay in just interest $668,333. I get that you can refinance assuming rates ever come back to earth, make extra payments, etc etc. to make this less insane.

As far as I can tell this is nearly the worst most expensive time to buy a house in the history of the housing market, and I don't need a house. I am under no pressure to buy. But I have always deeply wanted my own home and I feel like it would massively improve my quality of life. The cheaper houses under the median are very much starter homes and will require a lot of work, I'd rather get something around the median that is move in ready if I decide to buy. If I go down this path I will be a first time home buyer. The way I live right now, I should be able to continue to save around 65k cash each year if I don't buy a house. As for future relationships, I intend to remain childfree by choice. I also intend to remain in the home for at least 15 years maybe forever if I buy.

Today I started getting warning lights on my car that the transmission was having issues, took the car to a shop and they confirmed it would be about $5,000, about half of what the cars worth is on Blue Book. Not wanting to invest that amount of money back into the car, I sold it for around 8K.

I am looking to buy a car, and wanted to get some different perspectives outside of my family.

**Financials**

32 years old, make about 105,000 salary, living in DMV area (my exact location is not the highest cost of living in the DMV, I will call it moderate).

I save 1,200 - 1,500 a month without intensely trying to budget.

I have 70k in a HYSA , 15k in investments, and do not own property yet - although that is a shorter term goal if the housing market settles down.

I have no debt

I am not looking to buy anything frivolous, like an expensive sports car, but would like something ""nice"".

**Questions**

1. Am I insane for thinking it is a good idea to be looking in the price range of 20-25k for a used car with where I am at financially? This would be \~12-17K out of pocket (plus taxes and titles).
2. If the above is not absolutely insane, should I pull the entire amount out of savings and pay in full in cash? Do I finance the entire remainder cost? Or a hybrid approach where I would only pull out half of the amount of what's needed and finance the rest? My previous car was fully paid for, so I am not sure how I feel about adding a large monthly bill that was not present before.

I have very little cash savings, but do have $500k in 401k, home equity of about $300k (30 year interest rate is 3.1% so I'd rather not refinance). My $3k mortgage covered property tax and home insurance. Estimates on CalCovered (health insurance) is $2,000 for a family of 5. I suspect that would be reduced if I'm unemployed? I need a minimum of $6-7k/ month to cover necessities. No car payments, very little credit card debt. Been working since I was 16 and this is totally new to me and very anxious.

personalfinance,Advice Needed: Should We Move Next to My Mom’s House and Sell Our Current Home?,"My wife and I are considering buying the house right next to my mom's. She’s our babysitter and watches our child for free, but right now, we drive about 40 minutes each way to drop him off before work. Our current house is valued around $400,000 (we bought it for $280,000 at a 3% interest rate with a VA loan). Our monthly payment is about $2,000. If we sold now, we’d probably net around $130,000 after realtor fees, thanks to the improvements we’ve made.

The house next to my mom is listed at $210,000, though I think we could negotiate it down to $200,000. It needs some work, but I know a solid contractor who lives a few houses down. I’d likely set aside around $20,000 for initial renovations. However, the local public schools aren’t highly rated, which is a concern. There’s a good private school nearby, though, with tuition around $6,000 a year until high school, where it increases to $12,000 annually.

One hesitation I have is due to a major construction project planned near our current home — one of the biggest developments in the area. This project could significantly increase our home’s value over time, so I’m worried about potentially leaving money on the table by selling too soon.

On the other hand, moving next to my mom would mean a lower mortgage at around 6% with a VA loan, making our new monthly payment roughly $800 — saving us $1,200 each month. We could even opt for a 15-year loan and still have manageable payments.

personalfinance,Need help planning how to spend money beyond weekly budgetting,"
Help with understanding how to spend or save large amounts of money without running out, and why? How do people spend responsibly on big things?

We need help figuring out how to spend money. We used to figure out if we could buy something depending on how much money was in our account (not much at the time) but we could never get ahead that way, and freqentlygot im trouble with unexpected expenses. It was understandable when we only made a little, but we kept doing it even when ourpaycheck got better.

Now we finally figured out a weekly budget and for the most part don't go over that for small discretionary spending, but we got ourselves in trouble again by started an urgent building project with all our extra money, then being stuck home for a storm, missing work for being sick, and then both cars breaking at the same time. Now we have bills coming due that we can't pay on time, even though we make plenty of money. We're down to ""beans and rice"" again (and a few other things).

We've figured out budgetting day to day stuff for the most part, but how do people with lots of money budget the big things? How do you plan for large expenses like taxes or unexpected business expenses? How do you gradually get ahead?

Budgetting used to seem like arbitrarily picking limits to spend on certain things,and now I view it a lot differently as living within our means, planning for small unexpected expenses, etc. But now I'm having a hard time with how to approach large amounts of money and large expenses. Now that we're budgetting the small stuff, we can do the big stuff. But what else is it for? Why not soend all of it, other than an emergency fund? How much is the right amount to save versus spend? It all seems arbitrary to me again. A weekly budget makes sense now, because it's not arbitrary. I finally understand spending less than what you make, instead of whatever you have on hand. But the big stuff is confusing. 

How do people gradually become more wealthy without spending everything? Isn't the point of weekly and monthly budgetting so that you spend on big things? If we're saving extra for unexpected things, how much do we plan for? Is it arbitrary? I really need help with this conceptually. I know I'm missing something.",1731947739.0

personalfinance,Paying off all debt as soon as possible ,"Hey all looking for some advice 

My boyfriend and I are slowly paying off our debt. I am in my final semester of college and he has been helping me pay for school out of pocket. I put each payment on my credit card and then pay it off but of course due to other expenses my credit card is currently sitting at 3K. He has almost 9K on his credit card. Now in the spring I will have exactly 3 payments of about $450 that will be added to the card but we have been worried about his card growing so much so we are trying to decide on the best game plan for us. 

I make $2400 a month and he makes $2600 a month, our rent is $950. Starting this next month I will start paying all expenses in our house (besides his car payment, $270) and he will put his entire paycheck towards his card with the exception of his car payment. My school payments will be added to my card and I will pay the minimum balance due. It will take 4 months to pay off his card this way and after that we will switch and he will pay all expenses (besides my car payment, $273) at that point my card will be at at least 5K so it will take me at most 3 months to pay off my card. 

He has no phone payment and I pay $80 a month for my own phone plan (I have a separate bucket that I add money into each month so this can be left alone to pay for itself), all utilities except electric included in our rent, which is usually around $100 a month and internet is $80 a month. We are budgeting to keep $150 from each paycheck in our accounts for gas and groceries. We are prepared to be extremely frugal and do what it takes to pay this off as fast as we can.

personalfinance,College 529 Funds - rolling over to IRA,"So this post is not about the new rules in regards to 529 and rolling over to IRA but more about the tax scenarios involving earned income and how that affects contribution limits.

You can contribute - whatever is lesser of the two - your total earned income amount or the IRS-mandated contribution limit for a year. Separately, tax filing thresholds are almost twice what the contribution limit is for any given year. So, hypothetically, how would the IRS know if you max the IRA contribution limit from a college 529 rollover vs just against what you earned as income if you don't have to file a tax return?

EXAMPLE:

Earned Income: $4K   IRA Contribution Limit: $10K    Tax Filing Threshold: $15K    529 Funds: $100K

I roll $10K from my 529 funds into a Roth IRA - how would the IRS know I'm only supposed to rollover $4K if I don't  have to file a tax return? Say my earned income is all cash.

Perhaps the question is more general than relating to a 529 fund. I'm currently looking into opening a few for my kids so this was a question I was pondering.",1731947403.0

personalfinance,Enterprise/National Accident with no Insurance,"Hello, just looking for some guidance. A couple of weeks ago I flew home and rented a car from National picking the Emerald Isle option. There was a BMW X1 in the isle that they let me take for the same price. The next day, after burning the candle at both ends traveling, I was on my way to my aunts house and I fell asleep at the wheel. I ended up going into the median and I hit a dirt mound that caused front end damage and caused the airbags to deploy (see images). Overall I know its bad; I had a 2007 Silverado totaled due to a fender bender that you could barely notice last year, quoted $7,000 in repairs, so I can only imagine what this level of damage would cost on a BMW.

On the scene, OnStar (or something) came on asking if I was ok and that they were sending help. I got out of the car.... fine. I'm still fine, no concussion, etc.. The only lingering issue is the guilty overthinking of what could have happened... but that's a different discussion. On scene the officer came out and we did a sobriety test, blew a 0, and I admitted fault. She wrote me a $185 Reckless Driving ticket which I paid the next morning, but otherwise, everything was fine.

The next day I started digging into my rental details and discovered that that rental, and every rental I've had over the last 3 years (quite a few), has had all the insurance options declined. I have a code on my account from work (a perk) that I had always assumed took care of the insurance, but I guess it doesn't and I opted out of all the insurance options when setting up my online account with National, so when I go to reserve a rental online, it never asks. I currently live out of the country so I have no personal auto insurance, because I have no vehicle in the US. Luckily, I have a Chase Amazon Visa that I used to rent the car and in talking with them over a few day period, discovered that they are able to be the primary insurer with an uploaded *Statutory Declaration of no personal auto insurance.* The Credit Card states that it covers up to $60,000 in damages on non-exotic vehicles not valued over $125,000 USD. A 2025 BMW X1 is a small-luxury SUV that MSRPs around $42k to $52k. In the details, I dont see anything that would disqualify them covering me and I've already began the process with them

So how screwed am I?

Worst case the vehicle is a total loss? If that happens I imagine I'd basically have to buy the car if the card above for whatever reason doesn't do anything. If its repairable then I'd be directly responsible for all and any costs?

Lets say worse case, total loss, and I have a $50k bill to pay. Do I take the credit hit (currently 825) and settle the debt in collections? Do I just kiss my savings goodbye (which could cover the cost of one of those vehicles) and see the silver lining of still not having any debt?

Is there anything I could do in the aftermath? Lawyers or something. Work with my old insurance carrier to see if they can help, etc. I'm still waiting to hear back, so I have no idea what is to come numerically speaking.

personalfinance,Is it worth it to max out my HSA even if I risk failing the testing period next year?,"I recently became aware of the IRS rules about pro-rating HSA contributions and the testing period. I started a job in July, and have been contributing to an HSA.

I am signed up for my company's HSA plan next year, and have already elected to max out contributions for 2025.

Long story short, my attorney and I are currently in the final stages of negotiations with an insurance company. After the attorney's 33% cut, I'm looking at around $2-300,000.

* Do we agree that long term disability insurance is generally needed when you have dependents and mortgage payments?  Regardless of health?  No one plans to get sick and miss work but it happens all the time.
* You do *not* need *short* term disability insurance if you have a decent emergency fund?
* Long term disability is four times more expensive (for me) through a 3rd party vs a group policy at work.  The logic of ""you could lose your job, and therefore lose your insurance"" convinced me to switch from group to term for life insurance.  But I'm not sure if it's worth the cost for disability.
* If you have decent 401k savings, can or should you rely on ""hardship withdraws?"" instead of insurance.  I could contribute the amount that would be going to disability insurance to my 401k instead.

For me specifically, I'm 38, good health, but am the only worker in my family as of now (wife and two young kids).",1731933616.0

40K service – $798.30

Right engine mount replaced (found leaking) – $337.52

Battery replaced (failed their test, despite the fact that it showed no signs of problems to me) – $213.00

Tail Lights replaced – $64.40

Drive belts replaced (upon inspection, found one starting to crack) – $196.38

Oil Cooler replaced (leaking oil in coolant) – $369.48

Hello Reddit,

I am married, 24 years old, and I’m currently making ~$108,000 annually with RSUs for around $50,000 this year, and an annual bonus of around $10,000. 

Post- tax I take home around 4000 a month with 401k, and closer to $6700 without. 

I recently purchased a home for around ~400k, with a monthly payment of 3100. I was previously renting at 2100. 

Pre-tax 401k - ~$2000

House 7% - $3100 (400k remaining)
car 8% - $860. (39,000 remaining)
Utilities - $500. 
Student loans - $400 (25k remaining)

Unvested RSU value: $175,000

Is this over leveraging? I am afraid with a near 50% contribution to 401k while I will max in June next year for the first few months I will only be making ~4000 a month. 
Also, with kids I’m worrying about starting HSA contributions for daycare from pre-tax money. 

How would you handle your contributions? Is this too much monthly?

Do you have any suggestions for how I can improve my situation?

personalfinance,Am I overthinking this? ,"I’m 31 years old and plan to retire between the ages of 55 and 60. I would like to retire earlier, but I’m not sure if it will be possible. Currently, I rent and do not own a home or any rental properties. I’m trying to save for a home. I earn about $60,000 annually pre-tax, and my wife earns $29,000 annually post-tax. Together, we take home approximately $3,000–$3,200 per month. We live in Georgia.

I contribute 15% of my paycheck to a 401(k) biweekly, and my employer provides a 6% company match. My total retirement savings currently sit at $66,000: $9,000 in a Roth IRA and $56,000 in my 401(k), which is a Roth 401(k). My wife has about $3,000 in a Roth IRA, and that’s her only retirement account. We try to max out our Roth IRAs each year, but it’s sometimes challenging. Depending on the year, we might contribute $3,000, $5,000, or $7,000 in total.

My wife drives a 2023 Toyota Corolla with 26,000 miles on it, which is fully paid off. I drive a 2024 Corolla Hybrid with 13,000 miles. I could pay it off today, but that would leave us with only $6,000 in our bank account. We are prioritizing building our savings to $10,000 before paying off the car. Once my car is fully paid off, we’ll be debt-free and able to save aggressively for a home.

If all goes as planned, I’ll become a registered nurse in 2025, and my wife plans to enroll in dental hygienist school that same year.

My main concern is whether my investments are on track. Am I balanced enough? Are my fund choices the best available? What would you do differently? I’m 31 and feel worried that I haven’t yet reached the $100,000 mark in retirement savings.

-not sure if/how a trust plays into personal assets for things like FAFSA for kids school and such
-already divorced once and don’t plan to go down that road again, but want to make sure I have my finances set up in a way that would protect things if I did remarry, especially so it wouldn’t be absorbed by new person, and would be earmarked for the kiddos.

I am planning to set up a will and such this year and will already be working with an attorney, so figured it would be the right time.

Mortgage  half paid off  with very low interest rate(2.9)
Live off of about 65k a year

Assets:
1.  $100k savings (I'm a saver)

2.  $260k hysa ( conservative nature)
3.  $115k crypto ( initial investment of 15k was in 2020  bought  btc and eth and a few others)this was my one flier 
4.   $200k investment in cows that pays simple 20% (40k)  annually  every year. Family friend business I renew the contract for 200k annually untill I want to be done.
5. Old 401k with old job is at $90k

My goal is to get to 1.5mm in 10 years so in my mind I think this:

Currently at 765k from above
Annual growth now is:
40k from cows 
About 10k from hysa(for now)
I also am able to save  about 6k a month from income due to low cost of living.

1st question. Should I roll the olf 401k into a fidelity self brokerage traditional  ira or something  and just put it in voo or something? It is so stale with empowered plus their fees are higher than what I would pay with fidelity in voo.

2. Should I reduce the 250k  hysa  and some of that in something more risky, I like the  4.5 guaranteed for now...

3. I should take 7k a year from work and do a backdoor ira...

4..should I take 2k out of my paycheck and put it in a low cost index fund in my company 401k. They don't match... which is lame

Me: 41M, Executive Chef at a retirement community.  Single with a 12 year old who I have 50/50 custody of though never married and I live alone in a 1 bedroom that I pay $1950/month for.

Annual income before tax and 3% 401K contributions - $74K.

Spent almost $10K on a lawyer to gain 50/50 and as a result have to pay that back $7K in loans on CC's as well as a friend who loaned me $3K.

I also owe about $4,500 in taxes after erroneously filing 2 years ago. (This is accruing interest unfortunately.)

I also have a car loan that has about $15K left.

And finally I have student loans from culinary school that I have not ever been able to pay on that are sitting at about $50K.

Any thoughts from anyone on any of this?  Besides filing for bankruptcy as I am not inclined to do this as it will only forgive portions of my debt.

Edit:

personalfinance,Taxable Brokerage versus 401K loan for remainder of down payment.,"We are building a new home, which is now ahead of schedule due to the two homes in front of ours either changing lots or not getting approved for financing. We do not need to sell our current home to qualify for our new home. We went into pre-approval with nearly all savings in our bank that would be put towards 20% down payment with some rolled into higher rate CD's that were set to mature the month prior to our original build date. We were told to expect some delays due to building over winter months, which is why the CD's were reinvested for another 6 month window before we signed our contract.

All good problems to have except that now being ahead of schedule means we are going to be short 25K or so with most of that from the extra two months of savings missed and the CD's. We fully fund our retirement, and would be able to repay a 401K loan in the coming year giving us more of a cushion if needed.  This is what my dad had initially advised if we were short on funds or if build went quicker than expected. However I have 45K in taxable brokerage mostly in SCHB and some initial firms from starter investing before I moved to ETF, these have turned a good profit since the pandemic and all are now firmly back in gains territory ranging from 13% to 117%.

I know I'd pay myself back the 401K loan interest, but wouldn't it be better to sell the taxable shares in 2025 which would mean the 15% long term gains tax would be due in 2026 and keep the 401K in market? I could then reinvest out of the original holdings fully into SCHB or redistribute from lower profit stock no longer of interest and it would lock in some of the profits earned in past 5+ years. This taxable account is long term holdings for retirement or additional savings cushion as an extended emergency fund as I also have a deferred compensation plan to augment any early retirement and most of my extra funds go there to the maximum each year.

No one can predict the market, and with recent election, the interest rates and other movement has been all over the place so just want to ensure I am not missing an obvious benefit or reason to take out the 401K loan versus cover any shortage if they remain ahead of schedule with the taxable holdings.

I doubt based on the current timelines if the schedule at this point would fluctuate more than a month and go back to original dates, so just trying to be ready for having to fund ahead of the CD maturity dates.

Within the next six months, I will likely need $250k for a down payment on a home but I am concerned about the up-front tax hit. The account is at Schwab and I was looking into a pledged asset line. My understanding is that a PAL does not show up on a credit report and I am free to use this money as down payment with no impact to my DTI ratio with the bank/mortgage company. 



I am considering pledging the full account and draw $250k for down payment with the intention to liquidate roughly $50k annually the next five years to spread out the capital gains tax hit and pay back the draw. I want to see if others has done the same with a PAL and if there is anything you would do differently? Maybe liquidate a different amount annually ($25k? $10k?) instead and spread out the loan even longer? Other than spreading out the taxes, another reason that I want to put myself on a liquidation schedule is to mitigate the risk of a black swan event where my portfolio declines over 50% and I'm stuck in a situation where I need to transfer funds from another account to Schwab to have sufficient collateral.

I have a nearly perfect driving record, a nearly perfect credit record, and I’m in my early 60s, which is an age auto insurers don’t worry about much.

Their site was easy to use, easy to understand, and there was zero pressure. (Apparently all customer service with Lemonade is AI.)

Lots of questions.,"So as the title, my lovely wife (35F) has started hospice two days ago after fighting colon cancer for the past 3.5 years. We have 3 young boys (5YO, 3.5YO, 3.5YO). Due to costly medical procedures, we have never had extra money to put aside for the their education. We are expecting gifts (a few hundreds to a few thousands dollars) from relatives/friends. We already have funeral fund reserved, so we want to set this money aside for college if they so choose in the future. I have been researching for the past few weeks regarding 529 plans for our state Maryland.

However, there are a few questions I still have:

* Should I go with Maryland 529 plans instead of Nevada (or any other states) 529 plans? NV 529 seem to have the best reviews/recommendations due to their low fees, better yield/returns for investment. Going with MD 529 plans, I will have $2500/child tax deduction, which seem to be a minimal benefit compared to the better yield rates of NV 529 plans. MD 529 is administered by T. Rowe Price.
* It seems that I can open an umbrella 529 plan under my name (36 year-old) and name our kids as beneficiaries. Would that help with their Financial Aid situation in anyway? Any benefits of doing that instead of individual 529 plans for each child? From my understanding, if they have assets (529 plans under their names) during the FAFSA application, their Financial Aid amount will be smaller. I don't want to take advantage of the system, but I also want the best potential support for my children and maximize the value of our investment.
* If I choose MD plans, should I avoid MD's prepaid trust plan? It seems great on paper, but so many parents have issues getting money. Is that still an issue?
* Any other plans I should look at? Opening a 529 plans with Vanguard seems to be a pretty good investment as well. MD 529 (ran by T. Rowe Price) has higher fee (.64%) than Vanguard (.03%).
* My wife has been staying at home for the past 7 years, so she has insufficient social credits. Hence, the children will not get any survivor benefits. I am on my own to support them, which I have no complaints about. I just want to ensure the best possible future for them.

personalfinance,Rent vs buy when escaping foreclosure?,"Hello! If this is above Reddit’s pay grade I would love at least a direction to head in re: how to vet potential financial advisors.

So unfortunately the home I live in, owned by my mother, has been encumbered by a loan that is too large and has too short a deadline to be paid off (hard money lender). The foreclosure process hasn’t begun yet but it likely will by mid-next-year.

My cousin and I, combined, take home about $6,800/month after taxes + insurance and before any expenses.

The COL in our area is fairly high, so we can easily spend around $700/month on groceries alone for just the two of us before cat food and supplies. We already cook at home, and I usually eat fresh vegetables and canned goods, no meat, to try and pinch as many pennies as possible. Cousin requires a little more variety, so she eats meat, but overall we stick to versatile pantry ingredients. Internet is $100/month, phones are $120/month, and due to our current poor insulation, utilities are about $400/month and will likely go up as things get colder. We only drive to work, to the grocery store, and home, and gas is about ~$100/month.

We currently support my mother in full. She has no active source of income, and her bankruptcy should end in about 7 months. What we could be paying towards a mortgage is currently going towards storage units for things that were once held in a second house that has since been sold out of necessity. Money from that sale has been spent.

For my cousin and I, everything NOT OPTIONAL calculated together, including $30/mo in subscriptions and $130/mo for cat food and supplies but not including a possible rent/mortgage, our baseline lives cost $1,830/month to maintain.

For my mother, including her specific bills, subscriptions, health debt, gas, and groceries, her baseline is ~$1,350/month.

Storage fees are about $2,800/month. Assistance with these fees come from various one-off gifts from friends and family that are thankfully more well off.

Since the home we live in is definitely unaffordable, we have a disagreement regarding what the best option is for what housing everyone should move into.

My mother has no savings to speak of. She invested everything that divorce from my father didn’t take into starting a business, which failed. Any money she has is from either me and Cousin, or one-off handouts from friends and family.

My mom’s plan is as follows: Cousin and I purchase a fixer-upper house, which would cost up to $3,500/mo including mortgages and insurance (one mortgage for the purchase and one to cover the down payment; total depends on what we offer and what is accepted) but not utilities and I don’t believe taxes. There is no HOA to contend with. We pare down storage contents and dump the remaining objects into it. My mom moves in there, cousin and I follow temporarily. Mom improves a closed off section of the house with help from some connections she has (paid for by BARTER, not anything from us kids), and rents it out to cover the mortgage. After that is settled she would find her own employment in the nearby city. The moment my mother’s bankruptcy ends, we hand the rights to and monetary responsibilities of the house over to her and leave for our own apartment.

She is extremely domineering, opinionated, and difficult to live with long-term, so unless I would save up enough to retire by continuing to share a house with her, my immediate first move once possible would be to rent somewhere else with my cousin.

We could also just tell my mom we refuse to buy this house, and tell her that we could pay for part of her life, maybe a small apartment, some groceries, and her bills, but that would be the extent of our assistance. The average two-bedroom apartment in our area would be around $2,400/mo, not including utilities or any extra fees that apartment-hunt websites secretly omit.

My mom insists that it will always be more beneficial to everyone to own a property with a rental income, and NEVER rent from somewhere else. I understand where she is coming from, but I would prefer an option where I can disconnect from her and start reliably having my own savings. I already gave what few thousands I had squirreled away to support mom years ago—we’ve had monetary issues for ages. I can’t advance in my life without getting my savings built back up.

She very likely will not sell the current house before it enters foreclosure—she insists on trying to fight the financers in court. We can assume any extra money from selling it will not be available.

So, assuming we all do the same things we are currently doing, just without any storage, which option would most likely provide more financial security in the long term?

* Cousin and I purchase house with up to $3,500/mo mortgage + insurance, live there and wait for it to be monetized, then hand off to my mother after 7 months-1 year so we can move out
* Cousin and I scale back assistance we provide and move into our own apartment as soon as possible, with $2,400/mo rent before utilities, with housing for my mother going anywhere between $900/mo to $1,400/mo depending on where she lives and before she gains employment or housing assistance

personalfinance,Pro-Rata rule can sometimes be desirable?,"I have read a lot about the pro-rata rule (in the context of Backdoor Roth) and this is my current understanding. It is not a penalty, nor is it double taxation. It is effectively just converting pre-tax money into post-tax money, which seems to be not always ""bad"" depending on your financial goals. If you have pre-tax dollars sitting in a IRA account, pro-rata rule will trigger when the backdoor roth is executed. But that means over time, the basis in that IRA account increases, meaning that in the future you have to pay less taxes on that money upon withdrawal (because your increasing your basis). Building up basis over time can be a legitimate financial strategy.

I’m in the process of rolling over my 403(b) from my employer and wanted to confirm a few details and get some feedback on my plan:

* The $25K Roth balance will be deposited into a new Roth IRA (I already have an existing Roth IRA with Fidelity).

I’d appreciate confirmation that the pre-tax funds should go into a rollover IRA, not a traditional IRA (and any clarity on the difference would be great).

I know that 'Contributions can be withdrawn at any time without tax implications or penalties', but I'm hoping I can get some detail on how exactly that works when it comes time for taxes. I've transferred between a few different brokerages and have a basis carryover that I can't directly determine.  I have personal notes and intend to withdraw less than I contributed regardless.  

My question is will Vanguard send me a tax form of some sort indicating how much I've contributed and attesting that the amount I pulled is below that limit?  If not, do I need to report anything to the IRS and if so, do I need to provide anything that attests the amount I've contributed over the years or is that all tracked anyway?  Anything else I should be aware of before I pull it?  Thanks in advance!",1731862964.0
personalfinance,Prudential Long Term Care Bond,"Hello,  
  
I’m keen to hear if anyone has experience with, or knowledge about, Prudential's Long Term Care Bond. This product was originally purchased by my grandparents in 1997 under its former name, the Scottish Amicable Long Term Care Bond.

In 2020 we completed the sale of my grandparents’ home after my grandfather passed away and my grandmother moved into a care home. It seems that both of them held policies, but the capital amount was significantly lower than the £20,000 each had invested in 1997.

Given the product’s name, I had assumed it was designed to help cover care home fees if one spouse entered care after the other passed away. This is precisely the situation we are now facing. However, we haven’t had any communication from Prudential in the past four years. We also haven’t received any statements, details of key benefits, or other relevant updates regarding the product.  


The original documentation we have indicates some sort of £20,000 per annum payout, but it does not clarify under what circumstances or when this would be claimable.

There are a few articles online, whereby people had issues in receiving the investment value: See Guardian Article, from 2007 titled: Long-term care bond victory.

It would appear that 'Pru Intl review shuts LTC bond' in 2003.

If anyone has insights or additional information about this bond, I would greatly appreciate your input.

personalfinance,Looking for personal finance software to replace Quicken,"I've been using Quicken forever (20+ years now), but as the years go by, it just seems to perform worse, though it still has all the features I need to manage everything I need. My biggest gripe with Quicken these days is how slow it is to download the transactions for all of my linked accounts. It typically takes several minutes for about 5 accounts.

Over the past few years, I've looked at several alternatives (Empower, Mint, Rocket Money), and the biggest issue I've seen with them all is that none of them appear to let you manually add expected future transactions to linked accounts. I do this all the time in Quicken to plan out my expenses for the next month.

I'd love to find something that could link to my accounts like Quicken, but maybe perform a little bit better, and offer planning tools similar to what Quicken has.

Is there something out there that might fit the bill?

personalfinance,Looking for advice on house purchase at 7.5% interest rate vs staying in current home ,"Looking for some honest opinions on current situation. 

Current combined income month AFTER taxes: Oct-May $11,210 is and May-Oct is $10,250. Fluctuation reason is bc health insurance only gets deducted for 6 months out of the year from husbands paycheck. 

Currently own a home at 2.4% interest rate and have $170k left on the payoff. Current payment is $1049 per month. Super cheap I know.  

Found a new house I absolutely love. New mortgage payment after 20% down and considering the high interest rate now would be somewhere between 2,500-2,600/month factoring in taxes and homeowners insurance. 

We have 2 car payments, a camper payment, and other smaller debts. I’ve ran the numbers and it appears that we can afford it, while still being able to save 1k per month, but it’ll be tight. We also have 3 kids; one older barely adult, one heading to college soon and one in junior high. 

Husband will be getting promoted in January which will come with approx an additional +500 per month, plus ancompany truck and fuel paid for. And I receive general salary increase every July 3% which will be another $300 per month, approx.

I don’t want to bank on any increases though. And I don’t want to lower my savings amount per month. 

Here is why we’re considering the move. I am spending a ridiculous amount of time driving to the school multiple times a day for sports, anything is 15-20 mins away (we live rural). And also, we have some water issues as we have 5 people living in our home. We drilled a new well a few years ago but still during periods of drought it becomes a weekly issue that puts an undue burden on my husband. I could drill another well again, but there is never a guarantee we will hit good water enough to sustain this many people in our household. And I hate conserving water. I realize now we can buy whatever, save a lot , and go on trips, etc. but this is the trade off. The new purchase would mean no more water issues and no more extra spent on gas and time driving back and forth everywhere. 

I also work from home, husband does not.

personalfinance,What to do with savings (considering investing),"Hey everyone!

I’m 24 years old and currently in a stable financial situation – I own my apartment, have a car, and no debt. I also have enough savings to cover several months’ worth of expenses.

I’ve got around €2,000 set aside, and I’m trying to figure out what to do with it. I don’t want to leave it sitting in cash or in my bank account where it’s losing value due to inflation (I’m aware inflation won’t significantly impact such a small amount, but I’d still prefer to be cautious). I’ve been considering investing in stocks, specifically Nvidia, but I’m not necessarily aiming for high growth. My main goal is just to preserve the value of the money.

I also considered Palantir, but it seems too volatile and risky for me, and from what I can tell, a bit overvalued. I actually invested in Palantir before when the stock was around €25 but had to pull out after a couple of weeks for personal reasons. It stings a bit seeing it at €65 now, but I’m trying not to dwell on missed opportunities and focus on what’s next.

Do you have any advice? Is putting this amount into a single stock like Nvidia a good idea, or should I consider other options? I’m open to suggestions, especially if you have experience with investing smaller amounts

Financial Stats:

Credit score: 770s

Debt: Around 60k (20k student loans, 30k new car which was absolutely necessary, unfortunately.)

Savings: $45k (I save $3k a month. Goal: $100k.)

Salary: $86k 

401k: Not positive. I believe under $10k. (I match my companies 5% which I believe gives me $300 a month.)

HSA: $1k (I get $200 a month from my employer.)

Thats all. My goal is to continue saving as much money as I can to aid in my retirement & future investments (like a house). 

I know it isnt too bad but I am so anxious that I am not doing more, I know I can do more, I just have a severe gap in knowledge. I see people post about having $700k in investments or stocks & I feel behind. Speaking of S&P500, bitcoin & beyond. I dont even know if that means they have $700k to their name fully or just hypothetically because its a stock. I grew up in poverty so I taught myself everything. I feel the knowledge I am missing is what isnt easily taught/told to do by, say, Google. 

What else can I do to better at, or add to my portfolio? If you recommend investing, could you please give me a resource I can start reading into? I am so new to stocks, I dont want to go in & waste money.

Much appreciated. Apologies if this comes off frantic. I have had anxiety for a month about this but today I woke up with chest pain & said enough is enough.

personalfinance,Would it be a bad move to purchase a home in this financial situation?,"My significant other and I are in our early 30s and have been considering purchasing our first home but we are very unsure as to how to gauge what would be considered affordable without becoming house poor.

We live in a high cost of living state (Hawaii) and have been renting the same place since mid 2020.

Current rent: $1800 + Electric (\~$200)  + Gas stove (\~$40) + Water (\~$80). In terms of rent, it is a very good deal, everything nearby for rent for a similar space and size is easily 2.2k+ at the minimum. Since mid 2020 our rent has only gone up $50/month with the addition of paying for water which we originally weren't. Landlord is great, they are aware we are planning to look for a home and are willing to keep rent the same and roll month to month if we decide to sign/renew a 6 month lease (December - May).

We by chance happened to see a listing for a new build for a home \~$985,000 which is to be finished by the end of the year which includes up to $40,000 in closing costs on the sellers end. Median single family homes here are \~1.1 million and condos \~520k.

Pre-approval for a loan was completed and the estimated rate is ""6.125% at 3.125 points"" after buying down w/ the remaining closing costs. Estimated monthly payments of $5,420 (Principal & Interest $4800, Hazard insurance $150, Real estate taxes $285, HOA $186).

Combined yearly income of \~225k (\~120k + \~105k). Planning to split 50 / 50 for everything.  
Combined \~$11,900 per month after taxes & 403b, but Person 1 only contributing 3% to 403b and Person 2 only contributing 5% to 403b (3% match for both of us).  
Combined $380k in HYSA, \~80k in roth IRA, \~100k in 403b.

Job security is stable. No current health issues. No student loans or debts aside from recurring monthly bills (phone, car insurance, roth IRA contributions, netflix, HBOmax, spotify, amazon prime). Planning to have children in \~2 years.

We are on the fence on committing and worried about ending up house poor in the future after having kids / as HOA fees rise / unsure if we are contributing enough to our 403b to be secure into retirement. We have heard about 0.28 DTI (pre-tax income?) and 50 / 30 / 20 rules (post-tax income?) but am not sure if there are other ways to gauge this situation and would really appreciate some advice or guidance. We have only gone to this one home and haven't checked out / given a chance to looking at other properties which feels silly for such a major life decision. It is likely we end up purchasing a used home/condo if we don't secure this place as there aren't any new developments nearby in the upcoming year. It's just more so that this offer to cover closing costs and it being the last model of it's release left puts the pressure on. This development plans to make a mix of condos/townhouses/homes over the next 9 years but there is no official word of which order/timing of releases.



TLDR;

$985,000 new build home w/ $40,000 closing costs covered on sellers send.  
Planned down payment of 20% (\~200k).   
Loan: ""6.125% at 3.125 points"" after buying down w/ remaining closing costs.  
Estimated monthly payments of $5,420 (principal/interest, hazard insurance, real estate taxes, HOA) before utilities.

Combined yearly income: \~225k  
Combined \~$11,900 per month after taxes & 403b, but Person 1 only contributing 3% to 403b and Person 2 only contributing 5% to 403b (3% match for both of us).  
Combined $380k in HYSA, \~80k in roth IRA (maxed yearly), \~100k in 403b (Person 1 invests 3%, Person 2 invests 5%).

No major debts / loans. Planning to have children in \~2 years. Worried about ending up house poor / costs of children in the future / if we're not currently contributing enough to retire safely and would really appreciate advice or guidance. Thank you so much.",1731860752.0

personalfinance,Camper/RV Loan Advice Needed,"Hi All,

  
I am currently looking to purchase a new 2025 Scout Olympic truck camper. I have a couple of options to purchase this camper, and we wanted to ask Reddit what would make the most sense. Here are a few details of my situation that may determine which route we should take.

  
Camper Cost: $34,000

Savings: $50,000 in 5% APY HYSA (Yields $208/mo - $2,500/yr)

Credit Score: 794

Debt: none besides mortgage all vehicles paid off no student loans.

Costs: $2,000/mo (utilities/mortgage/groceries/gas insurance etc.)

Income: $5,400/mo
  
1) Purchase in full.

2) Finance w/ BECU RV Loan @ a rate of 6.99%.

3) Make a substantial down payment and finance the balance.

  
I am not making any large purchases anytime soon besides possibly this camper. We do not have kids. We each make roughly $100,000/yr each, however this would be funded by just me. Resale value on these things would most likely be around $28,000-$30,000 if sold after 1-2yrs of using it (if we do not like the camper but I would expect to have this for years to come).

  
I've racked my brain, but wanted to get Reddit's thoughts on this.

personalfinance,"trying to rebuild after two injuries killed my career and my savings., and nearly killed me.  ","sorry, this is long. 

hey folks. I could use some help. I'm already beaten down into the dirt, if you could refrain from insulting me, I'd appreciate it.  I'm in pretty bad shape financially. doing my best to claw my way out of it. 

I'm 46. I started out as an art professor, but the pay ($32k in nyc), stress, and job stability was so bad that I moved into doing project management and 3D design for cabinetry, millwork, furniture, and interior design, mostly for high end flagship retail stores. Made about $85k/yr living in NYC. At the time, I was an active alcoholic with severe untreated lifetime depression, so I didn't manage my money well. **I'm now 7 years sober** and working with a good therapist, things are much better but my finances are worse, due to the fact that....

during the pandemic, after being laid off for a year by covid, I got severely injured riding a bicycle. Broke 8 bones, collapsed a lung, had a brain hemorrhage, had 3 surgeries, was on oxygen for 3 months, etc. Took a year to recover enough to go back to work. 

A year after that, I had a traumatic brain injury skiing. The TBI severely affected my vision and brain function, and I am no longer able to work as a project manager or designer, or many other things. I was out of work for almost two years and then initially could only work part time. A couple years later and after spending thousands and thousands of dollars (my entire savings), on treatment for the TBI that wasn't covered by insurance (meaning basically all of it), and after numerous false starts with trying to go back to my old career and various other jobs, I finally have a full time year round job that I can do, working as a maintenance manager for a Property Owners Association. 

fwiw, the brain injury makes decision making very difficult, especially when i'm stressed, which is why i'm here. 

so here's my current situation: 

* 46 yrs old. single, no kids, one small dog. $500 in savings, $1k emergency fund, no retirement, literally no family left except my mom who is 72 and has no savings or retirement besides the $600k house she inherited. 
* Live in a remote mountain town of 2k people. COL is somewhat expensive, but my AA sponsor is here, my therapist is here ($30 a session, basically pro bono), my job is here, all my sober friends are here, etc. I have to go to another town 30 minutes away about once a week for healthcare, groceries, walmart, etc. Moving somewhere cheaper would cost me several thousand and my pay would drop by half. I like it here and would prefer to live here permanently. 
* make $34/hr, about $70k a year, will get a stipend for health insurance, 3 weeks PTO, 10 holidays, IRA with 3% match. flexible schedule. I live 6 minutes from work. 
* starting a second job teaching skiing on weekends at $20/hr in a couple weeks. there is a chance that it will be too much with the TBI and I'll have to quit and focus on my main job. I also live about 5 minutes from this job. 
* Rent is $1250 a month for a 1bedroom during winter. In the summers, I live in a camper on a friends land and pay no rent. 
* groceries are about $400/month. I'm already mostly eating rice and beans, cheap eggs, cheap bulk frozen turkey burgers, and oatmeal, so it would be hard to get this cheaper. I maybe eat out once a month, usually at McDonalds using a deal on the app. 
* car insurance is $200/mo. I shopped around a lot and this is as low as I can get it. I've never had an accident, but I got three speeding tickets last year while visiting my mom on the east coast, just wasn't used to there being cops everywhere. This will get lower next year when my tickets fall off. 
* about $70/wk on gas.
* phone is Mint, it's $50/mo. 
* have a 2020 F150 that is financed. has 100k on it. I've paid about $17k on it so far, currently owe about $16k. 11% interest. payment is $435 a mo. I do need 4x4 and high clearance where I live as it snows a lot and they dont plow much, most of the roads are dirt/mud in summer, etc. I also do haul stuff several times a week for work. I'm trying to sell this but it's difficult because no one wants to deal with paying off the loan and waiting for the title, and I've mostly gotten lowball offers. I would ideally like to get rid of it and get a 90s truck I can work on myself (yes, I actually can, i used to be a mechanic). 
* I recently inherited a 2005 dodge diesel truck that doesn't run. It's prob worth about $15k running, but I need to put about $1k-$1500 into it to get it working again. I'm considering selling the ford and keeping this since I know the truck inside out and how to fix it, and i dont want to deal with someone else's used truck with god knows what problems, but also diesels are a pain and expensive. 
* have three maxed out credit cards due to being out of work and all the medical bills. I paid these off every month before I got injured but now it's out of control. 1 @ $6000, 1 @ $800, 1 @ $3500. 
* $90k in student loans at 6%. in deferment currently. 
* dont have anything else I can sell, except for a bunch of tools in storage that's worth maybe $3k, hesistant to sell these as they are potentially a source for additional income next summer, as I'm a skilled carpenter and those are in demand here at about $35/hr. Not something I can do full time, but part time for additional income is an option. 

Ideally, I'd like to get rid of all my debt and buy a small piece of land and build myself a small house so I never have to move again, but I realize that's a long way off. 

I think that's it. Greatly appreciate any help.

I’m currently working and earning ~$300k/yr, I’m going to tell them about this situation tomorrow.

- $370k 401k
- $35k in each of our individual IRAs 
- $40k HSA
- $700k RSUs (big tech company I work for)
- $1k in 529 plan for son

Life insurance:
- $1.5mm in 20 year term life insurance I bought three years ago
- $900k from my work policy

Non-mortgage debts:
- $36k of student debt (mine) that will go away if I die
- No other debts. Cars and credit cards are paid off

Estate planning:
- going to have a lawyer draft a will that gives everything to my wife. I think this is how the law would operate anyway but better safe than sorry I guess. Will also allow for more sophisticated estate planning if necessary (trusts for the kid or something).

Just one main question for everyone: what can I do to make things easier financially on my wife and son if I die? Or even if I don’t die and end up requiring expensive treatment and might or might not be able to maintain employment? What should I be thinking of (other than the other obvious depressing stuff).

Both late 20s with 2 kids. I make 95k a year and job #1 and 20-25k at job #2. My wife makes 60k per year. Job #1 has a 9% 401k match and we contribute to the match and max our Roth IRAs each year. My wife’s job has a mandatory pension contribution of 9.5% of her salary. 

We own both of our vehicles, valued at 10k and 20k, and have no debt outside of our mortgage. The house is work around 400k and we owe 355k. As far as liquid assets, we have 60k in a taxable, 121k in my 401k, 123k in IRAs and 23k in my wife’s pension. Total NW sitting just under 400k. Should we adjust anything for next year?",1731857400.0
personalfinance,Mega Backdoor Roth Conversion Timing,"My employer started just this year.  I can do an in-plan conversion to a Roth.  Long story short, I didn't do it right away. It has to do with a planned retirement that I have decided to delay due to the outcome of the election.

My question may be stupid but I feel like I've looked everywhere and can't find the answer - does the conversion have to be done in the same year as the contribution?  Or can it be done at any time in the future?  My employer keeps bugging me via email to convert, but I thought I could do it anytime I wanted in the future.",1731856085.0

i had a lot of health issues this year, so my medical expenses are significantly higher. If I take my first beneficiary RMD in 2024, will the medical deductions (I itemize) help “soften” the tax impact of the aditional income?",1731854563.0

personalfinance,"How do I as a US/CAD PR living here, best empty an inherited IRA by 2032?","I am meeting with my wife's Canadian investment advisor and my Canadian x-border preparer, but have seen some great advice come from this group that may help me know what questions to ask. Here's the situation:

US citizen, early 60s, married and living with my Canadian wife as a PR for almost three years. Unable (unwanting) to work for a year until my PR status arrived, slowed by Covid. Mother died in 2022 leaving me about $350K US in an iIRA. Recent IRS rules give me a 10yr window to use the money. Now make over $200K CAD/yr at a corporate communications job so between the exchange rate and tax rate, I'm seeing a lot of this money potentially going away if I use it unwisely. My US advisor (basically my mother's former guy) who manages the iIRA is a little lost about what my Canadian status will have on the funds, so I find myself in a bit of a cross border quandry.

I had a healthy freelance video, design and film composition side business in the US and I'd love to use that money to transition from a corporate gig to a retirement gig that I thoroughly enjoy. Between my wife and I, we have enough but feel like a few more years of prudent earning/investing would position us for a comfortable post-9/5 life.

If I incorporated and built a studio (that could be sold as a studio or ADU) on our property, is there a way to move that money here and use it at a considerably lower rate? Are there other ways to save on taxes? I gladly pay out of my regular salary to support my new home, but for some reason I feel the desire to protect this inherited money as best I can and appreciate any ideas/input to do so.",1731852590.0
personalfinance,To Buy A Used Truck or To Not Buy?,"TLDR: I want to buy a vehicle before the end of year, is it the right move?

I currently drive a 2010 Nissan Altima with 250,000+ miles, I’ve had the car since high school (now 24) and have planned on driving it to 300,000. However, starting last year I’ve began having to put ~$3,000 a year in new parts into the vehicle to keep it running - this is getting costly for me.

I do not plan on selling the car as it’s paid off, I want to park it at my folks house (they’re willing to start/drive it when needed, air tires, routine maintenance, etc.) in Tennessee and over the next few years continue putting new parts into it. (I’m living Florida currently)

I don’t like and have never wanted to be in debt but the specific type of vehicle I want is a truck. I want a truck because it can be used as a tool for moving, will be safer, and I would be paying cheaper insurance than my current 2-door Altima. I would plan on doing all the regular routine maintenance on the truck as I have with my current car for it to last well over 200k. 

I would like to purchase a truck for ~$25,000 before the end of year as prices are the best for vehicles this time of year. Would this be a bad decision due to the major price point  or should I continue dumping the $3k annually into my car?

I’d like to pay $10,000 in cash and get a auto loan for the remaining $15,000. I have $0 in debt thankfully, $12,000 in a HYSA that I’ll use for the cash portion, $3,500 in savings, $1,000 in checking, $33,500 in a brokerage account (about $10,000 in cash at the moment), and $22,000 across my 401k and Roth IRA. I also currently make about $80,000 a year and have a 879 credit score.

Would I be making a bad decision to purchase a truck for $25,000? My rationale is the money I’m spending on my current car would just go into the trucks payment every year. I would also now have a truck I can use as a tool, safer vehicle, and larger for if/when I do have a family. I also have to drive somewhat regularly for work.

My ultimate goal in life is financial freedom and a purchase like this is hard for me to make, but I feel like it’s a justifiable decision if I’m planning on keeping the truck for 10+ years, and that I will be paying around the same or $100 more for the trucks payment and insurance versus the $320 monthly insurance payment I’m making on my 2010 Nissan Altima 2-door.

I thank you all in advance for any suggestions/advice in this situation.

personalfinance,Inheriting a modest house and car. What should we be doing now to be prepared financially?,My MIL recently passed away and my wife is the sole beneficiary.

personalfinance,Mother lied to get me to co sign,"Ok not me, but a friend...just thought saying me would get more attention.

Let's call my friend Alice 

Alice's mom tricked her into co signing for a car saying it was for my friend and that Alice would be getting the car. (Alice didn't want to cosign but her mom kept pressuring her and she eventually caved) 

Literally immediately after she found out her mom lied and the car is not for Alice but for her mom (who made her co sign)

Is there literally anything she can do about this? He mom is not very reliable when it comes to paying for stuff so I'm worried my friend is going to bite the bullet when her mom starts not paying for the car.
